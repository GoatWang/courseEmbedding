How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch to Rate COMM 2015-LC19 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





January 20, 2015 07:57 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM Mortgage Trust 2015-LC19 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$50,900,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,648,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$518,619,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$1,070,879,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$74,712,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$107,287,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$247,761,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,762,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$70,656,000ac class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$70,656,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$33,799,000c class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$14,231,000c class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of January 20, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $14,544,000 class 
      G or the $45,937,880 class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 59 loans secured by 139 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.4 
      billion, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Ladder Capital Finance, LLC, 
      Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, L.P. and KeyBank National 
      Association.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 71.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 79.6%, and asset summary reviews on 79.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has slightly higher leverage than 
      other recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate multi-borrower transactions. The 
      pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.18x is in line with the 2014 average of 1.18x, 
      while the pool's Fitch LTV of 108.9% is worse than the 2014 average of 
      107.5%.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 9.67% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity which is less than other recent 
      transactions. Thirteen loans (40.7%) are full-term interest only and 21 
      loans (29.3%) are partial interest only. Fitch-rated transactions in 
      2014 had an average full-term interest-only percentage of 19.9% and a 
      partial interest only percentage of 42.5%.
    

      Strong Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades of 'A-' 
      to five properties that represent 40.0% of the pool balance for Fitch 
      sampled loans, including three properties in the top 10: One Memorial 
      (10.1% of the pool), Gateway Center Phase II (7.4% of the pool) and 9911 
      Belward Campus Drive (6.9% of the pool). Additionally, nine of the 
      largest ten properties in the pool are located in primary markets 
      including Boston/Cambridge, New York, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San 
      Diego, Houston and Seattle.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 15.3% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2015-LC19 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly above 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      The master and special servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a 
      Division of PNC Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' and 'CSS1' by 
      Fitch.

Approximately $1.06 Billion of Structured Securities Affected

Cl. A-M, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Feb

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.2% 
of the current balance, compared to 4.8% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 5.1% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 4.8% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at 


http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 24, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the December 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1% to $1.41 
billion from $1.42 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 59 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans constituting 54% of the pool. Two loans, constituting 
11% of the pool, have investment-grade structured 
credit assessments.




Three loans, constituting 2% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




No loans have been liquidated from the pool. One loan, constituting 
less than 1% of the pool, is currently in special servicing. 
The specially serviced loan is the Holiday Inn Express Houston ($4.5 
million -- 0.3% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 70-room Holiday Inn Express franchised hotel located in Houston, 
Texas. The loan transferred to special servicing in August 2016 
due to low DSCR, noncompliance of borrower regarding the lockbox 
and Cash Management Agreement, as well as SPE violations. 
A substantial portion of the occupancy was due to petroleum related guests 
and property performance has declined significantly from securitization. 
The loan is current as of the December 2016 payment date, although 
the Borrower is in technical default due to the previously mentioned issues. 





Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 92% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 53% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 119%, 
the same as at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 12% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
10%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.52X and 0.89X, 
respectively, compared to 1.54X and 0.90X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The largest loan with a structured credit assessment is the 9911 Belward 
Campus Drive Loan ($98.3 million -- 7.0% 
of the pool), which is secured by an office/lab/industrial property 
located in Rockville, Maryland. The property is 100% 
leased to Human Genome Sciences, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline, 
who has guaranteed the lease through 2026. Moody's structured credit 
assessment and stressed DSCR are a1 (sca.pd) and 1.88X, 
respectively, the same as at Moody's last review.




The second loan with a structured credit assessment is the Harmon Meadow 
Portfolio Loan ($55.0 million -- 3.9% 
of the pool), which is secured by an interest in 11 parcels of land 
and two retail properties located in Secaucus, New Jersey and Ridgefield 
Park, New Jersey. The ten improvements in Secaucus are at 
The Plaza at Harmon Meadow and include hotels, restaurants, 
and other property types. The improvement at Ridgefield Park is 
a Hilton Garden Inn hotel. Moody's structured credit assessment 
is based on a look-through value of the underlying improvements. 
Moody's structured credit assessment is a1 (sca.pd), the 
same as at Moody's last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 24.4% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the One Memorial Loan ($144.0 
million -- 10.2% of the pool), which 
represents a pari passu portion of an aggregate $224.0 million 
mortgage loan. The loan is secured by a 17-story office 
tower located in the Kendall Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
The property was 97% leased as of September 2016, the same 
as in March 2015 and compared to 98% leased at securitization. 
The pari passu portion of the loan is held in the COMM 2014-CCRE21 
transaction. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 128% and 
0.78X, respectively, the same as at Moody's last 
review.




The second largest loan is the Gateway Center Phase II Loan ($105.0 
million -- 7.5% of the pool), which 
represents a pari passu portion of an aggregate $300.0 million 
mortgage loan that is secured by a 602,000 square foot (SF) retail 
property located in Brooklyn, New York. The property was 
recently constructed in 2014 and sits adjacent to the Gateway Center Phase 
I, which was developed by the sponsor and completed in 2002. 
As of March 2016, the property was 100% leased. The 
pari passu portions of the loan are held in the COMM 2014-CCRE20 
and WFRBC 2014-C24 transactions. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 114% and 0.78X, respectively, the same 
as at Moody's last review.




The third largest loan is the Central Plaza Loan ($95.0 
million -- 6.7% of the pool), which 
is secured by an 880,000 SF office campus with four office buildings 
located in Los Angeles, California. The buildings were constructed 
in 1952 and were renovated in 1992. As of December 2015, 
the property was 68% occupied, compared to 64% leased 
in November 2014 by a granular tenant mix of more than 200 tenants. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 126% and 0.84X, 
respectively, the same as at Moody's last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.
