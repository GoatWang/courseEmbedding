			on the closing and $1.6 million paid by execution of a secured promissory note. The Newsstand Distribution
			Services business and the Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business will retain all of their
			third party pre-closing assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including the negative working

            periods of 2014. The average gross profit percentage on land sales was 12.9% and 16.8% for 
            the second quarter and first six months of 2015 compared to 16.5% for each of the same two 
            periods of 2014. Revenues, average selling prices and related gross profits from land sales 
            can vary significantly from period to period as a result of many factors, including the nature 
            and timing of specific transactions and the type and location of land being sold.
          

            Prior to the closing, Mr. Duloc was the chief executive officer and president of AMREP's Newsstand
			Distribution Services business and Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business and certain
			other subsidiaries of AMREP.  
          

            "After many years in the magazine distribution and product fulfillment businesses, we are pleased
			that this transaction will allow AMREP to focus primarily on its real estate and subscription fulfillment
			services businesses to drive shareholder value," said Edward B. Cloues, II, Chairman of AMREP. "This
			disposition will sharpen our focus and strengthen AMREP's balance sheet by eliminating the negative working
		    capital overhang."
          

            Additional details on the sale transaction are provided in AMREP's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the 
			Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2015. 
          

About AMREP - AMREP Corporation's Palm Coast Data subsidiary provides subscription related services to
			publishers, membership organizations and others, its Kable Staffing subsidiary provides temporary staffing 
			services and its AMREP Southwest subsidiary is a major holder of real estate in New Mexico.
          

Forward-Looking Statements - This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements, including 
			statements with regard to the expected gain, if any, to be recognized as a result of the transaction and the 
			expected focus of AMREP in the future. Words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," and "future" or similar 
			expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject 
			to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions. Certain factors could cause actual 
			results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, and some of these factors 
			are discussed in the filings AMREP makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AMREP undertakes no 
			obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,

						 from   AMREP Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AMREP Corporation (NYSE:   AXR) today reported that it has sold its Newsstand Distribution Services business and its Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business pursuant to the sale of capital stock to entities controlled by Michael P. Duloc. The closing of the sale occurred on February 9, 2015.  
The buyers paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million, which consisted of $400,000 of cash paid on the closing and $1.6 million paid by execution of a secured promissory note. The Newsstand Distribution Services business and the Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business will retain all of their third party pre-closing assets, liabilities, rights and obligations, including the negative working capital of the Newsstand Distribution Services business, which totaled $12,672,000 at October 31, 2014.  AMREP expects to recognize a pre-tax gain on its financial statements as a result of the transaction in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 which it estimates will range from approximately $8 million to $10 million.   
Prior to the closing, Mr. Duloc was the chief executive officer and president of AMREP's Newsstand Distribution Services business and Product Packaging and Fulfillment Services business and certain other subsidiaries of AMREP.  
"After many years in the magazine distribution and product fulfillment businesses, we are pleased that this transaction will allow AMREP to focus primarily on its real estate and subscription fulfillment services businesses to drive shareholder value," said Edward B. Cloues, II, Chairman of AMREP. "This disposition will sharpen our focus and strengthen AMREP's balance sheet by eliminating the negative working capital overhang."
Additional details on the sale transaction are provided in AMREP's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 9, 2015.                                    
About AMREP – AMREP Corporation's Palm Coast Data subsidiary provides subscription related services to publishers, membership organizations and others, its Kable Staffing subsidiary provides temporary staffing services and its AMREP Southwest subsidiary is a major holder of real estate in New Mexico.
Forward-Looking Statements – This press release may contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements with regard to the expected gain, if any, to be recognized as a result of the transaction and the expected focus of AMREP in the future. Words such as "believes," "expects," "projects," and "future" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions.  Certain factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements, and some of these factors are discussed in the filings AMREP makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  AMREP undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
