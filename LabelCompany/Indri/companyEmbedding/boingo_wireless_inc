Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

About Us
Connecting People

 
Back in 2001 (when Wi-Fi was still called “802.11”) we dreamed of a world where people could connect to the wireless Internet anywhere, with any device. Today that dream is reality.

We have connectivity in our homes, our offices, our cities, our planes – even our National Parks. Over the past 16 years Boingo has grown from start-up to the leading Wi-Fi company in the world, and the largest indoor DAS (cellular) provider in the United States. And we’re just getting started.

History[edit]
In 2001, Earthlink co-founder Sky Dayton founded Boingo to address the then-fragmented state of Wi-Fi networks.[4] He said he saw how Wi-Fi "could help make the Internet as ubiquitous as the air we breathe".[5]
In March 2007, Boingo acquired Concourse Communications Group,[6] which extended Boingo's services into Wi-Fi and cellular DAS networks at airports.[6][7]
On November 10, 2008, Boingo acquired Opti-Fi Networks’ Wi-Fi holdings, adding another 25 airport Wi-Fi networks to its portfolio of managed locations and bringing its total of airport Wi-Fi networks to 55.[8]
On May 4, 2011, Boingo Wireless went public, giving the company a market cap of approximately $439 million. The stock price dropped soon afterward, and Boingo's IPO was initially viewed as "less than auspicious",[9] but the stock recovered a year later to its IPO price.[10]
On August 8, 2012, the company acquired Cloud Nine Media, thereby adding advertising services for sponsored Wi-Fi.[11]
On February 21, 2013, the company acquired Endeka Group, a provider of Wi-Fi and IPTV services to military bases and federal law enforcement training facilities.[12]
In November 2013, Boingo announced contracts with the US Air Force, US Army, and US Marines Corps to install IPTV and broadband access networks on their posts.[13]
In September 2013, Boingo announced the acquisition of its largest competitor, Advanced Wireless Group (AWG).[14] At the time of the announcement, AWG operated networks at 17 US airports, including Logan Airport (BOS), Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Miami International Airport(MIA). Boingo announced that the combined entity would operate in 60 percent of North America’s top 50 airports and more than 40 percent of the world’s top 50 airports, reaching more than 1.4 billion passengers annually.[15]
In February 2014, Boingo launched Passpoint Secure hotspot service at 24 US airports, including LAX, Chicago's O'Hare, and New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports.[16] In June 2014, the company partnered with American Express to offer its Platinum card holders free wireless access.[17]
In April 2015, Boingo struck a deal with wireless carrier Sprint Corporation to offload the carrier's customer traffic onto Boingo's Wi-Fi networks at 35 US airports. The deal was reportedly struck to improve Sprint's network performance.[18]
As of April 2017, Boingo's market capitalization stood at $506.6 million.[2]
Products and services[edit]
Boingo acquires long-term wireless rights in large venues like airports, military bases, stadiums, and universities; builds DAS, Wi-Fi, and small cell networks to serve those areas; and monetizes those networks through advertising, carrier fees, or user charges.[19]
Consumer services[edit]

Boingo Broadband - Boingo provides residential high-speed wireless Internet and IPTV services for troops stationed on US military bases, plus Japan.[20]


Boingo Wi-Fi - Boingo sells Wi-Fi access to end users at a network of managed and operated Wi-Fi hotspots and third party locations around the world.[21]


Boingo Media - Boingo sells advertising on its Wi-Fi platform. Consumers can receive free Wi-Fi in exchange for watching an ad.[22]

Business services[edit]

Distributed antenna system (DAS) - Boingo designs, builds and maintains DAS networks for carriers, to improve cellular coverage in buildings. As of November 2016, Boingo has reportedly deployed over 36 DAS nodes and claims to be the largest indoor DAS provider in the United States.[23] Its DAS deployments include Chicago's O’Hare International Airport, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City,[23] and the Oculus World Trade Center Transportation hub.[24]


Wi-Fi Offload - Boingo sells wireless carriers the ability to offload their licensed network traffic onto unlicensed spectrum.[18]


Small cell - Boingo designs and manages small cell networks in venues and sells carriers access to the network. Small cells act as an extension of a macro cellular network and provide more cellular coverage and capacity.[25]


Loyalty programs – Consumer brands, such as American Express, offer free Boingo Wi-Fi access to members as part of their card benefits.[17]


Platform services - Boingo licenses its proprietary software, and provides software integration and development services to customers, allowing them to sell their own Wi-Fi services.[26]


Roaming services - Boingo sells roaming services across a network of over 1 million[27] hotspot locations to business partners, who use this service to provide mobile Internet services to their customers. The company is integrating Hotspot 2.0 technology, also known as Passpoint, allowing users to automatically connect when within range of free Wi-Fi service.[28] Through a roaming deal with Time Warner Cable (now known as Charter Spectrum) announced and launched in 2014, this technology allows newer smartphones with Wi-Fi Alliance-certified Passpoint clients to move between and automatically connect to networks operated by both companies.[29]


Turn-key solutions - Boingo sells turn-key Wi-Fi solutions to venue operators, including installation, management, and operation.[30]

Awards and recognition[edit]

2009, 2011-2016 - Global Traveler Best Wi-Fi Service[31][32][33][34]
2015 - Wireless Broadband Alliance Industry Awards – Best Wi-Fi Network Operator[35]
2016 - LightReading Leading Lights Award – Most Innovative Wireless Service[36]

History[edit]
In 2001, Earthlink co-founder Sky Dayton founded Boingo to address the then-fragmented state of Wi-Fi networks.[4] He said he saw how Wi-Fi "could help make the Internet as ubiquitous as the air we breathe".[5]
In March 2007, Boingo acquired Concourse Communications Group,[6] which extended Boingo's services into Wi-Fi and cellular DAS networks at airports.[6][7]
On November 10, 2008, Boingo acquired Opti-Fi Networks’ Wi-Fi holdings, adding another 25 airport Wi-Fi networks to its portfolio of managed locations and bringing its total of airport Wi-Fi networks to 55.[8]
On May 4, 2011, Boingo Wireless went public, giving the company a market cap of approximately $439 million. The stock price dropped soon afterward, and Boingo's IPO was initially viewed as "less than auspicious",[9] but the stock recovered a year later to its IPO price.[10]
On August 8, 2012, the company acquired Cloud Nine Media, thereby adding advertising services for sponsored Wi-Fi.[11]
On February 21, 2013, the company acquired Endeka Group, a provider of Wi-Fi and IPTV services to military bases and federal law enforcement training facilities.[12]
In November 2013, Boingo announced contracts with the US Air Force, US Army, and US Marines Corps to install IPTV and broadband access networks on their posts.[13]
In September 2013, Boingo announced the acquisition of its largest competitor, Advanced Wireless Group (AWG).[14] At the time of the announcement, AWG operated networks at 17 US airports, including Logan Airport (BOS), Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Miami International Airport(MIA). Boingo announced that the combined entity would operate in 60 percent of North America’s top 50 airports and more than 40 percent of the world’s top 50 airports, reaching more than 1.4 billion passengers annually.[15]
In February 2014, Boingo launched Passpoint Secure hotspot service at 24 US airports, including LAX, Chicago's O'Hare, and New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports.[16] In June 2014, the company partnered with American Express to offer its Platinum card holders free wireless access.[17]
In April 2015, Boingo struck a deal with wireless carrier Sprint Corporation to offload the carrier's customer traffic onto Boingo's Wi-Fi networks at 35 US airports. The deal was reportedly struck to improve Sprint's network performance.[18]
As of April 2017, Boingo's market capitalization stood at $506.6 million.[2]
Products and services[edit]
Boingo acquires long-term wireless rights in large venues like airports, military bases, stadiums, and universities; builds DAS, Wi-Fi, and small cell networks to serve those areas; and monetizes those networks through advertising, carrier fees, or user charges.[19]
Consumer services[edit]

Boingo Broadband - Boingo provides residential high-speed wireless Internet and IPTV services for troops stationed on US military bases, plus Japan.[20]


Boingo Wi-Fi - Boingo sells Wi-Fi access to end users at a network of managed and operated Wi-Fi hotspots and third party locations around the world.[21]


Boingo Media - Boingo sells advertising on its Wi-Fi platform. Consumers can receive free Wi-Fi in exchange for watching an ad.[22]

Business services[edit]

Distributed antenna system (DAS) - Boingo designs, builds and maintains DAS networks for carriers, to improve cellular coverage in buildings. As of November 2016, Boingo has reportedly deployed over 36 DAS nodes and claims to be the largest indoor DAS provider in the United States.[23] Its DAS deployments include Chicago's O’Hare International Airport, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City,[23] and the Oculus World Trade Center Transportation hub.[24]


Wi-Fi Offload - Boingo sells wireless carriers the ability to offload their licensed network traffic onto unlicensed spectrum.[18]


Small cell - Boingo designs and manages small cell networks in venues and sells carriers access to the network. Small cells act as an extension of a macro cellular network and provide more cellular coverage and capacity.[25]


Loyalty programs – Consumer brands, such as American Express, offer free Boingo Wi-Fi access to members as part of their card benefits.[17]


Platform services - Boingo licenses its proprietary software, and provides software integration and development services to customers, allowing them to sell their own Wi-Fi services.[26]


Roaming services - Boingo sells roaming services across a network of over 1 million[27] hotspot locations to business partners, who use this service to provide mobile Internet services to their customers. The company is integrating Hotspot 2.0 technology, also known as Passpoint, allowing users to automatically connect when within range of free Wi-Fi service.[28] Through a roaming deal with Time Warner Cable (now known as Charter Spectrum) announced and launched in 2014, this technology allows newer smartphones with Wi-Fi Alliance-certified Passpoint clients to move between and automatically connect to networks operated by both companies.[29]


Turn-key solutions - Boingo sells turn-key Wi-Fi solutions to venue operators, including installation, management, and operation.[30]

Awards and recognition[edit]

2015 - Wireless Broadband Alliance Industry Awards – Best Wi-Fi Network Operator[35]
2016 - LightReading Leading Lights Award – Most Innovative Wireless Service[36]

History[edit]
In 2001, Earthlink co-founder Sky Dayton founded Boingo to address the then-fragmented state of Wi-Fi networks.[4] He said he saw how Wi-Fi "could help make the Internet as ubiquitous as the air we breathe".[5]
In March 2007, Boingo acquired Concourse Communications Group,[6] which extended Boingo's services into Wi-Fi and cellular DAS networks at airports.[6][7]
On November 10, 2008, Boingo acquired Opti-Fi Networks’ Wi-Fi holdings, adding another 25 airport Wi-Fi networks to its portfolio of managed locations and bringing its total of airport Wi-Fi networks to 55.[8]
On May 4, 2011, Boingo Wireless went public, giving the company a market cap of approximately $439 million. The stock price dropped soon afterward, and Boingo's IPO was initially viewed as "less than auspicious",[9] but the stock recovered a year later to its IPO price.[10]
On August 8, 2012, the company acquired Cloud Nine Media, thereby adding advertising services for sponsored Wi-Fi.[11]
On February 21, 2013, the company acquired Endeka Group, a provider of Wi-Fi and IPTV services to military bases and federal law enforcement training facilities.[12]
In November 2013, Boingo announced contracts with the US Air Force, US Army, and US Marines Corps to install IPTV and broadband access networks on their posts.[13]
In September 2013, Boingo announced the acquisition of its largest competitor, Advanced Wireless Group (AWG).[14] At the time of the announcement, AWG operated networks at 17 US airports, including Logan Airport (BOS), Detroit Metropolitan Airport (DTW), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), and Miami International Airport(MIA). Boingo announced that the combined entity would operate in 60 percent of North America’s top 50 airports and more than 40 percent of the world’s top 50 airports, reaching more than 1.4 billion passengers annually.[15]
In February 2014, Boingo launched Passpoint Secure hotspot service at 24 US airports, including LAX, Chicago's O'Hare, and New York's JFK and LaGuardia airports.[16] In June 2014, the company partnered with American Express to offer its Platinum card holders free wireless access.[17]
In April 2015, Boingo struck a deal with wireless carrier Sprint Corporation to offload the carrier's customer traffic onto Boingo's Wi-Fi networks at 35 US airports. The deal was reportedly struck to improve Sprint's network performance.[18]
As of April 2017, Boingo's market capitalization stood at $506.6 million.[2]
Products and services[edit]
Boingo acquires long-term wireless rights in large venues like airports, military bases, stadiums, and universities; builds DAS, Wi-Fi, and small cell networks to serve those areas; and monetizes those networks through advertising, carrier fees, or user charges.[19]
Consumer services[edit]

Boingo Broadband - Boingo provides residential high-speed wireless Internet and IPTV services for troops stationed on US military bases, plus Japan.[20]


Boingo Wi-Fi - Boingo sells Wi-Fi access to end users at a network of managed and operated Wi-Fi hotspots and third party locations around the world.[21]


Boingo Media - Boingo sells advertising on its Wi-Fi platform. Consumers can receive free Wi-Fi in exchange for watching an ad.[22]

Business services[edit]

Distributed antenna system (DAS) - Boingo designs, builds and maintains DAS networks for carriers, to improve cellular coverage in buildings. As of November 2016, Boingo has reportedly deployed over 36 DAS nodes and claims to be the largest indoor DAS provider in the United States.[23] Its DAS deployments include Chicago's O’Hare International Airport, the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels in New York City,[23] and the Oculus World Trade Center Transportation hub.[24]


Wi-Fi Offload - Boingo sells wireless carriers the ability to offload their licensed network traffic onto unlicensed spectrum.[18]


Small cell - Boingo designs and manages small cell networks in venues and sells carriers access to the network. Small cells act as an extension of a macro cellular network and provide more cellular coverage and capacity.[25]


Loyalty programs – Consumer brands, such as American Express, offer free Boingo Wi-Fi access to members as part of their card benefits.[17]


Platform services - Boingo licenses its proprietary software, and provides software integration and development services to customers, allowing them to sell their own Wi-Fi services.[26]


Roaming services - Boingo sells roaming services across a network of over 1 million[27] hotspot locations to business partners, who use this service to provide mobile Internet services to their customers. The company is integrating Hotspot 2.0 technology, also known as Passpoint, allowing users to automatically connect when within range of free Wi-Fi service.[28] Through a roaming deal with Time Warner Cable (now known as Charter Spectrum) announced and launched in 2014, this technology allows newer smartphones with Wi-Fi Alliance-certified Passpoint clients to move between and automatically connect to networks operated by both companies.[29]


Turn-key solutions - Boingo sells turn-key Wi-Fi solutions to venue operators, including installation, management, and operation.[30]

Awards and recognition[edit]

2009, 2011-2016 - Global Traveler Best Wi-Fi Service[31][32][33][34]
2015 - Wireless Broadband Alliance Industry Awards – Best Wi-Fi Network Operator[35]
2016 - LightReading Leading Lights Award – Most Innovative Wireless Service[36]

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







Boingo Hotspot has been under maintenance at the St. Louis airport since October. Tech support offers no excuses, no apologies, no estimated repair date. I had to go to 2nd level tech support on a 20 minute call to get this much information. The I don't care attitude is front and center.  Don't waste time or energy on this connection "solution"







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Horrible wifi, even worse website. Last customer service call I could barely hear the representative with all the laughing and joking from background employees. Unfortunate the military doesn't offer many wifi options in the barracks.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.







I use boingo on a military base in my dorm and it is a steaming hot pile of spaghetti code garbage. My comouter is rsrely able to connect to the ISP in the first place, and when it does it only give me about a third of the speeds I pay for. If you have any other options for ISPs, go with the other option. Im forced to stay with them because its the only ISP on base.







Got swindled by their airport scam. Paid for an hour of service and found out I was billed monthly for almost a year. Only managed to get 7 months of it returned so I paid $34 for less than an hour of internet. And I only used it because the "free" airport internet they provided wasn't working. What a corrupt company, they should be shut down.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

Boingo Hotspot has been under maintenance at the St. Louis airport since October. Tech support offers no excuses, no apologies, no estimated repair date. I had to go to 2nd level tech support on a 20 minute call to get this much information. The I don't care attitude is front and center.  Don't waste time or energy on this connection "solution"

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

I use boingo on a military base in my dorm and it is a steaming hot pile of spaghetti code garbage. My comouter is rsrely able to connect to the ISP in the first place, and when it does it only give me about a third of the speeds I pay for. If you have any other options for ISPs, go with the other option. Im forced to stay with them because its the only ISP on base.

Got swindled by their airport scam. Paid for an hour of service and found out I was billed monthly for almost a year. Only managed to get 7 months of it returned so I paid $34 for less than an hour of internet. And I only used it because the "free" airport internet they provided wasn't working. What a corrupt company, they should be shut down.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

Would be so kind as to message us the gate/terminal you were located at so we can escalate for investigation? Thank you kindly.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies...

...
OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(

--
The (final) update:
I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.

To summarize:
-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service
-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)
- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected
- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through
- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page
- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud
- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra charges

Suggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.







50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.







Glad I checked YELP before signing up with Boingo.  So many bad reviews and this company is still around.







UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. 

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.

I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.







OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.







Do not use do not use do not use being charged for services I do not use do not use do not make an account this is a scam







This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.







Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.







Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.







Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.

My words of advice:

1) Boingo train your reps. 
2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.
3) If you have other choices, use them.
4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.
5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.
6) Don't get Boingo.







I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.







The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!







This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.







I can't connect to Boingo Wireless at Logan Airport. And I am a software engineer.







30 minutes complimentary? That's it??? I watched your ad, and would be happy to watch another. F***ing joke you all should **** yourselves hope google or Apple destroys your market







I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.

Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.







Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.







Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.







This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.







Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

Same happened to me as to the other guys... I signed up on the airport, the connection was OK, but... 3 days later I get an email with a new receipt of using their service again which I didn't. I tried to call the service number - no way, try to access my on-line account - no way. So I wrote an email to Lauren which replied to some of the guys - let's see if she replies......OK, update - email from Lauren - automatic reply: I'm out of the office... :(--The (final) update:I was contacted by the customer  service and my contract was canceled.To summarize:-I was at the airport with a long waiting time between the flights, so I registered for the Boingo Internet service-One week later I receive an email from Boingo with receipt for one day Internet service  what seams some kind of automatic connection to me at the time (at this point I think that whenever a Boingo wlan is picked up by my computer, my account will be automatically charged for the connection)- I try to log in to my Boingo account to turn off this option, but I fail. There is no user-name data in the registration conformation mail and the user-name I try to use is rejected- I try to call customer support number but I can not get through- I google for other people experiences with Boingo and end up on this page- I see that other people had similar experience and think the whole thing is a fraud- at the end the customer support was fast and fair - my account was canceled without any extra chargesSuggestion to Boingo: when a user register for the service, the confirmation mail should contain his/hers user-name. Also check the log-in page to the Boingo account. If I was able to log in and see my actual service terms and how much connections I made and I was charged for, I would react much calmer. I change my rating of Boingo from 1 to 3 stars.

50 dollars a month for what's supposed to be 30 mbps speed, I have never seen more than 5 mbps. To top it off, it has never failed to go out completely at least once a day if not more. Terrible, most of the time useless, that's precisely how I would describe Boingo wireless service.

UPDATE: I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and only AFTER I filed this complaint (I contacted their company; they tried to lie to me and keep it all) did they silently and swiftly refund my $14.90. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. I have filed a complaint with the BBB about this company and my bank will be contacting this company about their fraudulent charges made to my account. I used this service once and I read the terms and conditions before allowing them to charge my card, and they are currently trying to steal money from me and their customer service representative lied to me and tried to trick me. They've only agreed to refund half of this false charge. I am in the process of refuting this fraudulent charge. Never purchase anything from this company.I paid $6.95 for a one-time charge for 24 hours of free wifi and I read ALL the terms and conditions before I let them charge me through PayPal. SURPRISE, they charged me an extra $14.90 yesterday (several days after I used their service) when I did not connect to their hotspot or log in at all. I called them about this and they are only refunding me half of that $14.90. I wonder if it will even come through. DON'T let them scam you out of your money. Don't let them trick you or lie to you and immediately de-authorize any payments to Boingo Wireless. Contact your bank and the BBB if they have tried to fraud you out of your money.

OUTAGE ALMOST EVERY OTHER WEEK!!!!! I live in the Army barracks, where the only internet we can get is Boingo wifi which costs me $50 a month. I chose the most expensive plan thinking I could worry less about the internet now. TURNS OUT I'M WRONG! Just this week alone we had a base-wide outage on Tuesday. And today is Saturday, the day I usually play online games and watch youtube all day. GUESS WHAT? ANOTHER OUTAGE!!! It has been 8 hours since I reported it but they STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT! ! ! Thank you Boingo for ruining my Saturday. I don't know how much they paid the Army to be the only authorized wifi provider for Army bases, but please Army, change it to another company please. I am already tired enough training for the whole week, I do not want to get frustrated on the weekend because of the darn WIFI.

This company is the worst wireless service provider I have ever experienced. Not only is it awful WiFi in general, they hide behind their sketchy policy and before you know it you have a bunch of money taken out of your account. Once it's taken out they refuse to refund it. This company and their customer service is a joke.

Boingo internet is absolute garbage. They like to shut off and lose connection every other minute. They like to charge you when there internet is crap and not refund you or compensate you. They tell you to basically deal with it. I get better service at mcdonalds hotspot.

Be Careful!!  I had signed up for Boingo and decided to cancel.  Instead of fully cancelling, I changed to "pay as you go".  My iPad or iPhone had the boingo app and it "auto connected" at the airport.  Did not use at all... but found out after the fact that I had incurred $31 of charges over the course of 2 days because they charge you for each time it connects.  Needless to say, be careful if you cancel.  No refund offered.

Boingo is worthless, first being in a hotel that only offers it on base sucks. I needed it to work from but due to their poor service and untrained phone reps who just go through the card on their screen, I was unable to because of the service outage.  When the rep on the phone asks me to "connect to base Wi-Fi" and I say its not there I told you that already, his answer shouldn't be "well connect to boingo Wi-Fi and go to cnn." Because if I could do that I would have. Lastly, if I pay for a service it had better be down for seconds, not over a day. Don't be stupid and use boingo, pay the money for a real ISP.My words of advice:1) Boingo train your reps. 2) Step up your techs, 24+ hours without service makes me want to punch something.3) If you have other choices, use them.4) If you don't have other services buy a hot spot, trust me it is still better.5) If you like self inflicted pain, call the service reps.6) Don't get Boingo.

I've had Boingo for almost 2 years now and I've never had a problem until my recent move. I've made numerous calls about the lack of connection and they repeatedly told me they would send someone out and at one point even made an appointment to send someone out but they called 2 days prior and said the connection was fixed. The problem was still there when I got home. Since then I've made multiple calls and I keep getting the same response from the support team "we will put in a request to have them call you" still no calls.  If you can't service an area. Then don't charge them for service they are not/can't get.

The service is horrendous! I got it as benefit from my American Express card. It's suppose to be premium package but then when you start to use Boingo abroad for 1 month out of year, they will send you a warning notice. They will not specify exactly what you did wrong instead they just pointed their agreement which basically they have the "power" to restrict your access. If you complain, asking for the review, they suspend your service again with no specific reason. They love you as customer when you don't use it but when you start to use it, they will restrict your usage. Glad we didn't pay real money for it however disappointed that the benefit from Amex is not really a benefit, more like a scam!!!

This is not a real service. Don't sign up because you will end up being charged - in my case double charged for over a year. I was able to get $100 refund but truly an unscrupulous business with shady business practices and a customer service department that is very limited. I was on and off the phone for half the morning.

I'm currently trying to use this service at NY JFK airpoirt.  It's terrible.  I just paid for it but get constantly disconnected.  And when it does connect the speeds are quite slow (0.8/0.4 mbps up/down when I got a test to run).  Even loading the boingo.com website itself to try to take further actions on the account is very slow.Naturally I'll try to cancel the monthly service I just signed up for, but based on the other reviews on here I worry that I'll have some trouble.  As with many sketchy companies, the question then becomes -- why do other, more reputable brands (major airports and airlines) drive business to them?  I wish I knew.

Updated review



Well, here we go again. Competitors are taking their time figuring out where to install their networks, so I still have Boingo... and, out of the last 5 days, the Internet has barely worked while I'm here (which has been often). Their customer service is quite nice, though, their troubleshooting logic seems to come from pre-made lists, since I was asked for the current speed test info when I said the internet was down.... The problem is: problems persist. They're not unworkable 24/7, but they're down or rediculously slow, with inconsistent speeds inexcusably often when pitted against their competitors. I have other complaints about their services too, but I wouldn't hold them lower (than 1 star) because they're issues that I presume are the military's fault, maybe not theirs.

The military uses boingo access to provide what they deem to be Internet options in the barracks. I signed up for internet as I moved in after my divorce , and as of this writing, I still have it while I'm waiting for other providers to setup service to my room. Their service, despite charging roughly the same as a high speed internet package from Comcast or Century Link, is the worst service I've ever paid for. Their connectivity is fleeting, their speeds varied and slow, their customer service slow, illogical and unhelpful, and are always insisting their systems show no problems ( despite other devices and people having the same issues constantly and concurrently), asking for speed test and ping data, etc. to troubleshoot connection issues... As soon as I can, I'll be rid of this service and will never pay for Boingo again, airport, gov buildings, or otherwise.

Worst fucking service ever, I'm paying 50$ for the best plan they got and my Xbox one is unplayable. This is the only wifi choice we have in the barracks and they take advantage of it. I can barely watch a video on my phone.

This is the worst internet/tv/phone provider I have experienced. This is my second time with Boingo in two different locations with the 30 dollar monthly plan. All i have to say is my one bar 4G on my iPhone runs laps around this service. Boingo figure out something new because your service is slower than dial up and you have officially wasted my money twice now. Congratulations but never again.

Was at the LAX for 3 hours, so figured i'd finally give paid service a try. Paid $8 for 24 hours of wireless. 30 minutes in it goes down and completely disappears as a wi-fi option. In other words, $8 wasted.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
