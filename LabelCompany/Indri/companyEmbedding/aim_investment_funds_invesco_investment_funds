Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote*For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds outperformed their Lipper peer-group averages. Results will vary for other time periods.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Vanguard stock funds


93% of our low-cost stock mutual funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Give your money a chance to grow over the long term
Get higher potential for investment growth



Stock mutual funds aim to provide long-term growth, unlike bond funds, which focus on income. In exchange for more growth, however, you're likely to experience more ups and downs in the value of your investment.

Increase diversification in your portfolio



A stock fund could give you access to hundreds—sometimes thousands—of stocks, which spreads out risk more than owning individual stocks.

Get broad exposure to the stock markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the stock portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of stocks in a single, diversified fund.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund holds more than 3,000 domestic stocks.

Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund holds more than 5,500 non-U.S. stocks.

How to choose a stock fund



Here are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right Vanguard stock fund for your portfolio:

How do stock mutual funds differ from one another?



When looking for a stock fund, consider these two characteristics:

Investing style. In general, stock funds invest in value stocks, growth stocks, or a blend of the two.

Capitalization. Stock funds also choose investments based on the size, or capitalization, of a company. Companies are considered either small-, mid-, or large-cap.


See a complete list of Vanguard stock funds


Do I want domestic or international stocks?








Investing in both U.S. and international stock funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While actively managed funds give you a chance to beat the benchmark, they can also underperform.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Should I focus on a specific industry?



You can choose a fund that invests solely in a specific sector of the market, like health care, technology, or telecommunications.But remember, these funds have a very narrow focus and expose you to more risk. Sector and specialty funds should only be used to supplement an already diversified portfolio.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

The team at KB Exchange Trust answered all my questions promptly,
enabling my investment purchase to be done quickly and efficiently.
Monthly distributions have been on schedule or even early, deposited
directly into my checking account.

- L. Agin, DST Investor, Arizona


KB Exchange Trust's closing process was easy. I especially like their online
document vault. Having a net-leased property with a reliable cash flow
is greatly appreciated...especially since my monthly distributions are made by direct-deposit.
- H. Trenkamp, DST Investor, New Jersey


 I am pleased to know I have a Fortune 500 tenant on a 15-year lease. All
my monthly distributions have been received as projected. For me, this
investment has been worry-free.

This website does not offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities. Offers can only be made through the Private Placement Memorandum which contains various and important risk disclosures. This brochure does not purport to be complete and should be viewed in conjunction with the Private Placement Memorandum. An investment of this sort is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Projections of future performance contained herein are based on specific assumptions discussed more fully in the Private Placement Memorandum and do not constitute a guaranty of future performance.
DST Interests in any of the properties displayed on this website may be sold only to "accredited investors," as defined in Regulation D under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), which, for natural persons, refers to investors who meet certain minimum annual income or net worth thresholds. Offers and sales of DST interests have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the laws of any U.S. state or non-U.S. jurisdiction and may be offered only pursuant to an exemption from such registration. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other regulatory authority has passed upon the merits of an investment in the DST Interests, has approved or disapproved of DST Interests or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this website and any supplementary materials describing the DST Interests. DST Interests are also not subject to the protections of the Investment Company Act of 1940, including the limitations on self-dealing, affiliated transactions and leverage contained therein. DST Interests are subject to legal restrictions on transfer and resale in accordance with the governing documents of the Trust and applicable securities laws, and investors may be unable to sell or transfer their DST interests. In addition, there is no public market for the DST interests and no such market is expected to develop in the future. Investing in the DST securities involves risk, and investors should be able to bear the loss of their investment.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Explore high-conviction investing with Invesco

                                           At Invesco, high-conviction investing means helping our clients achieve outcomes that go beyond the limitations of traditional market benchmarks.






                                                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
                                              




Our high-conviction strategies include these distinct approaches





Fundamental active
Portfolio managers choose investments based on the fundamental of a company and its stock or bond.



High conviction means assessing companies on how financially strong they are, not just how big they are.

Factor-based smart beta
Passive vehicles track indexes designed to provide exposure to certain investment factors.



Built from investments with specific characteristics – quality, low volatility, fundamentals and other relevant factors.

Posted by Nick Kalivas, Senior Equity Product Strategist on Sep. 26, 2016

The high beta, value and size factors outperformed the broad-market S&P 500 Index by a sizeable margin during the third quarter. The S&P 500 Index rose a healthy 3.85%, but 14 smart beta strategies and two smaller-cap indices all outperformed the broader market.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks long-term growth of capital and, secondarily, current income by employing a total return approach, emphasizing capital appreciation, current income and principal preservation. The fund may act as a foundation for investors' portfolios.

			
			
				
			
		



Dividend growers
A high-conviction, actively managed strategy that focuses on dividend-growing companies and seeks to deliver attractive total returns — combining appreciation, income and preservation — over a full market cycle.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Appreciation


A history of adding value
			The fund had a cumulative return of 272% since manager inception versus 257% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.1




Income


A focus on sustainable and growing dividends
			The fund's annualized dividend growth rate was 12.48% since manager inception versus 7.65% for the S&P 500 Index and 5.76% for the Russell 1000 Value Index.2 Please note the dividend growth rate is not a yield or a measure of fund performance but is based on the annualized growth rate of the fund's actual dividend payments. 
		



Preservation


A solid foundation for your equity portfolio
			The fund's Class A shares at NAV outperformed its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, by 9.95% in the last major bear market.3



58% of the fund's total return came from reinvested dividends

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Invesco Diversified Dividend Fund Investor Guide
Investable Ideas: Dividend value investing








 About risk
			 


Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return through growth of capital and current income.

			
			
				
			
		



Diamonds in the rough
An actively managed strategy that aims to build wealth over time. The fund seeks to outperform by making early and patient investments in large companies whose true value isn't recognized by the market.

Experience our high-conviction approach


Competitive returns


A history of adding value
      Since manager inception, the fund’s Class A shares has delivered higher returns than its benchmark on a cumulative basis, 256% versus 210% and on an annualized basis, 7.49% versus 6.65%.1 



Contrarian approach


A focus on portfolio diversification through contrarian investing
      The team's high-conviction, contrarian approach is designed to uncover undervalued companies during market downturns, setting the fund apart from its benchmark, and providing portfolio diversification aiming to participate in market upswings. 



Added value with our contrarian approach for the 20-year period shown through March 31, 2017
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $56,785, beating its benchmark.





The fund returned 428% over the last 20 years1
A $10,000 investment in the fund at NAV would have delivered $52,777 beating its benchmark and peers.

For standardized fund performance, visit the fund’s performance page.
Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Visit invesco.com for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end sales charge. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.
 Additional information

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the
same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the
underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to
distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights
with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The
Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than
if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that
the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative
contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require
payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the
derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater
than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund’s
returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments
may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may
be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or
price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during
which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions.
Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to
changing government regulation that could impact the Fund’s ability to use
certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the
expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Emerging Markets Securities Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund’s foreign investments may be
adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or
taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and
the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange
controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign
securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate
fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such
foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure
to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging
strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser’s judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund’s portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative,
regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the
Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund’s investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund’s shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual
stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain
other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the
financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When
markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments
held by the Fund will rise in value.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. Investments in real estate related
instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or
technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of
real estate related to the Fund’s holdings. Shares of real estate related
companies, which tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more
volatile and less liquid.
Sector Focus Risk. The Fund may from time to time invest a significant
amount of its assets (i.e. over 25%) in one market sector or group of related
industries. In this event, the Fund’s performance will depend to a greater
extent on the overall condition of the sector or group of industries and there
is increased risk that the Fund will lose significant value if conditions
adversely affect that sector or group of industries.

Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to
the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity
securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall
stock market.

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?

In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Layer opened.Expense ratio







A mutual fund's annual operating expenses, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average net assets. It's calculated annually and removed from the fund's earnings before they're distributed to investors, directly reducing investors' returns.An expense ratio includes management, administrative, marketing, and distribution fees. It doesn't include loads or purchase or redemption fees.




Return to main page








footnote*Vanguard average mutual fund expense ratio: 0.12%. Industry average expense ratio: 0.69%. All averages are asset-weighted. Industry averages exclude Vanguard. Sources: Vanguard and Morningstar, Inc., as of December 31, 2016.
footnote**For the 10-year period ended March 31, 2017, 9 of 9 Vanguard money market funds, 51 of 54 Vanguard bond funds, 23 of 23 Vanguard balanced funds, and 99 of 107 Vanguard stock funds—for a total of 182 of 193 Vanguard funds—outperformed their Lipper peer-group average. Results will vary for other time periods. Only mutual funds with a minimum 10-year history were included in the comparison. Source: Lipper, a Thomson Reuters Company. The competitive performance data shown represent past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. View fund performance
footnote***The "Money 50" list published in the January/February 2017 Investor's Guide of Money magazine is based on mutual funds and ETFs that are low-cost and produce long-term returns that match or beat their benchmarks. Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
	Vanguard provides services to the Vanguard funds and ETFs at cost.

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

McInnes Cooper Charlottetown office initiated the Business Tree Planting Challenge in 2014 and the City of Charlottetown has been working in partnership with them to organize this initiative ever since. This year, three City of Charlottetown Certified Sustainable Businesses joined McInnes Cooper in the tree planting challenge, including Buns and Things Bakery, Howatt's Enviro Paints, and Invesco. Volunteers from the three businesses, along with City staff, planted the trees at Upton Farmlands, adding to the existing Confederation Forest initiated in 2014 by the Macphail Woods Ecological Forestry Project. The City used an equation cited by Conservatree.org to calculate the approximate number of trees needed to provide the amount of paper each participating business uses in a typical year. The equation is based on one tree producing 8,333 sheets of paper.  The participating businesses covered the cost of their trees, which are all PEI native species ordered from the PE J Frank Gaudet Tree Nursery.

As well as focusing on financial sustainability through the services they offer, the Charlottetown Invesco branch operates with an emphasis on environmental sustainability.

Our Corporate Properties team goes to tremendous effort to minimize our footprint and promote sustainability on an ongoing basis, ensuring we remain both LEED and ISO certified year after year. This new Certification from the City of Charlottetown serves as an excellent local representation of Invesco’s global commitments to the importance of environmental issues." Invesco has an active Green Team made up of employee volunteers who participate in various environmental efforts, such as the Business Tree Challenge, where a business plants trees to offset their paper-use. The staff gives back to the community through their Invesco Cares Committee, which donated $6,789.00 in 2016 to local charities and fundraisers.

History[edit]




Invesco headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia


INVESCO (all caps) was created in Atlanta in 1978 when Citizens & Southern National Bank divested its money management operations.[6] In 1988, the company was purchased by the British firm Britannia Arrow, based in London, which later took the INVESCO name.[7] In 1997 INVESCO PLC merged with AIM Investments.[8] Upon completion of the merger the company adopted the name Amvescap.[9]
Since 2000 Invesco has grown through acquisitions such as the ETF firm PowerShares Capital Management and the restructuring of WL Ross & Co.[8]
In 2004, the company agreed to a $450 million settlement with the Attorneys General of New York, Colorado and the SEC after allegations of improper trading practices.[10]
In May 2007 the company changed their name to Invesco (initial cap only) PLC, moved its primary stock market listing from the London Stock Exchange to the NYSE and became domiciled in Bermuda, adopting the name Invesco Ltd.[11] As a result, the company's shares were withdrawn from the FTSE 100 Index and added to the Russell 1000 index.[12] In November 2007, Invesco moved its headquarters from London to Atlanta.[6]
Invesco plans to list the PowerShares Global Progressive Transportation Portfolio (PTRP on the Nasdaq Stock Market.[13][14]
On October 19, 2009, Invesco bought Morgan Stanley's Retail Unit, including Van Kampen Investments for $1.5 billion.[15]
In April 2010, Invesco Aim became Invesco. Later that year, it was reported that Invesco had plans to introduce a Risk parity commodity fund according to regulatory filings.[16]
In December 2013, Invesco reported assets under management (AUM) of $778.7 billion[17]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Takes your existing debt and try to settle with your creditors for a lower amount.
                                    If you pay off the settled amount, your debt will be considered paid in full.
Negotiates with your creditors on your behalf.
Fee based on a percentage of your total starting debt or a percentage of the debt they save you.
Most settlement companies have you create a separate "escrow" account where you will make monthly
                                    contributions over a certain amount of time to contribute to your settlement. Once there is a
                                    substantial amount of funds to show your creditors, the settlement company will try to negotiate
                                    a lower amount of debt.





Combines all your debts and creditors into one monthly payment.
Allows you to pay one monthly payment to the consolidation company,
                                    instead of multiple payments to different creditors.
You no longer owe your original creditors; instead you pay one monthly
                                    payment to your consolidation company.
Consolidation companies can help negotiate lower interest rates on your
                                    debts and help lower your total debt payment in the long run. A lower
                                    interest rate will lower the amount you owe in the end.





Allows you to consolidate all your different debts into one personal loan that can be paid off over time.
Can offer borrowers a lower 
interest rate with a longer payback term (compared to high-interest credit cards or medical bills). This will lower the amount of money required to pay off the loan over time.
Personal loan debt consolidation can be an effective way to raise your credit score quickly (within 3-6 months).
Borrowers can receive funds from their loan within only a few days.

Want us to review a company? If there is a debt company that you don't see on our site, and would like us to review, please contact us.
Real Reviews (yes they’re real) With so many debt relief companies out there, and a lack of sites willing to bring you the HONEST breakdowns of each company, what source can you turn to for the real information you can trust?

We are dedicated to bringing the truth out, and rank debt relief companies as they should be. Through our investigation, and experience with each company, we rank each company, and bring you our honest, unbiased opinion. 
We also include 
authentic
 user reviews by past customers of each company that are moderated and verified.

Like many sites, we are compensated through affiliate relationships with each company we review, however all of our rankings are based on our 
11-Point Ranking Criteria.

All reviews are subject to moderation and approval. Any reviews that may resemble false information, or competitors of another company will need to be verified by our staff before being approved and published. We reserve the right to approve or deny any reviews left on this site.




Tax Relief
												9-Point Ranking Criteria



We evaluate each debt company we review on a strict, unbiased 9-point ranking system. Experience has shown that this is an effective way of determining a company’s ability to serve customers. Below is an outline and explanation of why each criteria point is important.




Price: 7% of Overall Score
Price is an important component of our debt settlement rankings. While this criteria point doesn’t carry as much weight as it does in the debt settlement and consolidation rankings, it’s still important. This point is not as weighted because other factors like the staff members of a company or the overall trust in them is a more important aspect of a tax relief company. Most companies you will need to call to get a price for your specific situation. Companies are awarded the maximum number of points if they display pricing on their site. Some points are award for general pricing information online, and some for giving pricing over the phone.
Professional Association Members: 7% of Overall Score
There are various organizations or associations that both companies and individuals can become affiliated with. Just because a company is a member of one of these organizations does not mean that they are a company that you should automatically be ok working with. However, when a company is a member it greatly increases the likelihood that they are a trustworthy business because of the standards that these organizations enforce. Certification with one or many of these organizations is a sign of trustworthiness to a certain extent.
Some of these associations include: The American Bar Association (ABA), The American Society of Tax Problem Solvers (ASTPS), National Association of Tax Resolution Companies (NATRC), American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), National Association of Tax Professionals (NATP), National Association of Enrolled Agents (NAEA), and National Association of Tax Professionals (NATP).
Staff Accreditations: 7% of Overall Score
A company’s staff credibility is an important aspect to receiving tax relief. It is important to know if a company has these members on staff. Each staff member’s certification and credibility to deal with customer tax relief is an important factor to the trust and legitimacy of a company.

Enrolled Agent: An Enrolled Agent (EA) is an individual that has completed certain certification steps to be allowed to work with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They are empowered by the Department of Treasury. An EA is able to work with individuals in all 50 states. They are an essential part of a good tax relief company.
Tax Attorneys:
Tax Attorneys have passed board exams and ideally have an excellent understanding of tax laws. They differ from regular attorneys in that they have dedicated additional time to focusing more specifically on tax laws. They are an incredibly important part of a good tax relief company.
CPA:
Having a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) on staff is important because they generally have a very good understanding of taxes and finance in general. They have passed specific exams and been certified to help with taxes. They are a (word cut) valuable resource for individuals regarding taxes.

Refund Policy: 6% of Overall Score
A trustworthy tax relief company stands by their word and they won’t make promises they can’t keep. A refund policy is one way of knowing whether a company will stand by their work or not.
 

Tax Problems a Company Works With: 5% of Overall Score
We want to see that a company can handle the following tax problems:

Wage Garnish Relief
Back Tax Solutions
Tax Audit
Tax Lien
Levy
Asset seizure

State Availability: 6% of Overall Score
Not all tax debt relief companies offer their services in every state. Because we want to reward companies that can help the greatest number of people, the more states a company works in, the higher their score.
IRS Negotiation Tactics: 5% of Overall Score
We want to see that a company has experience negotiating with the IRS in the following ways:

Offer in compromise
Installment agreement
Currently not collectible
Penalty Abatement
Innocent spouse relief
IRS Appeals

Minimum Tax Debt: 5% of Overall Score
As with most debt relief companies, tax relief companies will often only work with someone who has a certain amount of tax debt. The lower the minimum debt requirement is, the higher a company scores in this category.
Contact Information: 4% of Overall Score
The easier a company is to get ahold of, the better they are for consumers to work with. We judge companies based off whether or not they provide the following:

Email

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
