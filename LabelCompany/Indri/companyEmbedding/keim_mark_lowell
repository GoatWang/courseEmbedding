Obituary
Condolences


































 LOWELL I. KEIM, 86 MT. CARROLL - Lowell I. Keim was a loving, caring and hardworking man who appreciated the little things. Lowell died at the age of 86, on Saturday, March 15, 2014 at Rockford Memorial Hospital, Rockford, Illinois. Lowell was born on January 22, 1928, the son of Edwin and Garnet (McGinty) Keim in rural Salem Township. He attended Mt. Carroll High School and graduated with the Class of 1946. He proudly served his country for two years in the United States Navy aboard the U.S.S. Navasota. Lowell married Joyce Wise on September 4, 1949, at the Mt. Carroll United Methodist Church. Joyce died on October 10, 2009 at her home in Mt. Carroll. Lowell was a 4th generation Salem Township farmer. Together, Lowell and Joyce bred purebred Brown Swiss Cattle for forty years on the family farm, which was purchased in 1961. Lowell was a sports enthusiast and was a member of a successful bowling team and the Mt. Carroll Merchant's Softball Team. After his retirement, Lowell played golf several days a week with his friends. Lowell was a mentor to younger people interested in agriculture and was active in the 4 C's. Lowell had a significant influence in helping his two sons develop their businesses. Most of all, Lowell loved spending time with his family and friends, sharing stories and anecdotes from his past. Lowell also had a wonderful sense of humor and played several practical jokes over the years. Lowell was a longtime member of the Mt. Carroll Methodist Church. He was also a member of the Masonic Lodge, Commandery and Consistory and was a past Master of the Cyrus Lodge #188 in Mt. Carroll. Lowell was active in the Canton, State and American Brown Swiss Cattle Breeder Association and was past president of the Illinois Brown Swiss Association. Lowell was also involved in his community, serving on the Chadwick School Board, as a Fire Department Trustee and as a member of the Lions Club. Lowell is survived by his two sons, Chris (Ann) Keim of Ft. Atkinson, Wisconsin, and Curt (Jo Ellen) Keim of New Berlin, Illinois; four grandchildren, Sarah (Mark Klebanoff) Keim of Worthington, Ohio, Rebecca (Nathan Pruitt) Keim of Slingerlands, New York, Aaron (Nicole) Keim of Hood River, Oregon and Katie (Aaron Williams) Keim of Waverly, Illinois; three great-grandchildren, Claire Garnet Pruitt, Elizabeth Anna Pruitt and Greta Louise Klebanoff; and one special friend, Jean Guentner. Lowell was preceded in death by his parents; wife, Joyce; and two brothers, Herb and Donald Keim. A visitation will be held from 5 to 8 p.m., Tuesday, March 18, 2014 at Frank-Law-Jones Funeral Home, Mt. Carroll. A Masonic Service will be held at 4:30 p.m., prior to the visitation at the funeral home. A private funeral service will be held at a later date and burial will follow in the Oak Hill Cemetery, Mt. Carroll. Memorials may be directed to the Illinois 4-H Foundation, the Brown Swiss Historical Society or the Mt. Carroll Methodist Church in Lowell's memory. Friends are invited to share in Lowell's life at www.lawjonesfuneralhome.com.

Lowell I. Keim passes away


Wednesday,
March
19th,
2014




Lowell I. Keim was a loving, caring and hardworking man who appreciated the little things. Lowell died at the age of 86, on Saturday, March 15, 2014 at Rockford Memorial Hospital, Rockford, Illinois. A visitation will be held from 5:00 – 8:00 p.m., Tuesday, March 18, 2014 at Frank-Law-Jones Funeral Home, Mt. Carroll. A Masonic Service will be held at 4:30 p.m., prior to the visitation at the funeral home. A private funeral service will be held at a later date and burial will follow in the Oak Hill Cemetery, Mt. Carroll. Memorials may be directed to the Illinois 4-H Foundation, the Brown Swiss Historical Society or the Mt. Carroll Methodist Church in Lowell’s memory.
Lowell was born on January 22, 1928, the son of Edwin and Garnet (McGinty) Keim in rural Salem Township. He attended Mt. Carroll High School and graduated with the Class of 1946. He proudly served his country for two years in the United States Navy aboard the U.S.S. Navasota. Lowell married Joyce Wise on September 4, 1949, at the Mt. Carroll United Methodist Church. Joyce died on October 10, 2009 at her home in Mt. Carroll.
Lowell was a 4th generation Salem Township farmer. Together, Lowell and Joyce bred purebred Brown Swiss Cattle for forty years on the family farm, which was purchased in 1961. Lowell was a sports enthusiast and was a member of a successful bowling team and the Mt. Carroll Merchant’s Softball Team. After his retirement, Lowell played golf several days a week with his friends. Lowell was a mentor to younger people interested in agriculture and was active in the 4 C’s.
Lowell had a significant influence in helping his two sons develop their businesses. Most of all, Lowell loved spending time with his family and friends, sharing stories and anecdotes from his past. Lowell also had a wonderful sense of humor and played several practical jokes over the years.
Lowell was a longtime member of the Mt. Carroll Methodist Church. He was also a member of the Masonic Lodge, Commandery and Consistory and was a past Master of the Cyrus Lodge #188 in Mt. Carroll. Lowell was active in the Canton, State and American Brown Swiss Cattle Breeder Association and was past president of the Illinois Brown Swiss Association. Lowell was also involved in his community, serving on the Chadwick School Board, as a Fire Department Trustee and as a member of the Lions Club.
Lowell is survived by his two sons, Chris (Ann) Keim of Ft. Atkinson, Wisconsin, and Curt (Jo Ellen) Keim of New Berlin, Illinois; four grandchildren, Sarah (Mark Klebanoff) Keim of Worthington, Ohio, Rebecca (Nathan Pruitt) Keim of Slingerlands, New York, Aaron (Nicole) Keim of Hood River, Oregon and Katie (Aaron Williams) Keim of Waverly, Illinois; three great grandchildren, Claire Garnet Pruitt, Elizabeth Anna Pruitt and Greta Louise Klebanoff and one special friend, Jean Guentner.
Lowell was preceded in death by his parents, wife, Joyce and two brothers, Herb and Donald Keim. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Lowell Keim
