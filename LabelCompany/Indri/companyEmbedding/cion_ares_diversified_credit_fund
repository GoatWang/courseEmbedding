OVERVIEW
CION Ares Diversified Credit Fund (“CADC”) is a diversified, closed-end management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.  The Fund has elected to operate as an “interval fund” and by doing so will conduct quarterly repurchase offers between 5% and 25% of the Fund’s outstanding shares at Net Asset Value but is still considered to have limited liquidity.  CADC is designed for suitable long-term investors seeking superior risk-adjusted returns over an extended time horizon and should be considered speculative and not viewed as a trading vehicle.





 


OUR OBJECTIVE
To provide superior risk-adjusted returns across various market cycles by investing in a diversified portfolio of liquid and illiquid asset classes. The fund seeks to capitalize on market inefficiencies and relative value opportunities throughout the entire global credit spectrum.





 


OUR STRATEGY
The Fund will invest primarily in a portfolio of directly originated loans, secured floating and fixed rate syndicated loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial real estate loans and other types of credit instruments.








Fund FAQs



What is CION Ares Diversified Credit Fund? 



                                    CION Ares Diversified Credit Fund (“CADC”) is diversified, closed-end management Investment Company that has elected to operate an interval fund.  The fund seeks to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns across various market cycles by investing in a diversified portfolio of liquid and illiquid credit investments.                                




What is an Interval Fund? 



                                    An interval fund is a type of investment company that periodically offers to repurchase its shares from shareholders. That is, the fund periodically offers to buy back a stated portion of its shares from shareholders. Shareholders are not required to accept these offers and sell their shares back to the fund.
Legally, interval funds are classified as closed-end funds, but they are very different from traditional closed-end funds in that:

 Their shares typically do not trade on the secondary market and are considered to be illiquid. Instead, their shares are subject to periodic repurchase offers by the fund at a price based on net asset value. Shareholders should not expect to be able to sell their shares regardless of fund performance.
They are permitted to (and many interval funds do) continuously offer their shares at a priced based on the fund’s net asset value.
 




Who is Ares? 



                                    Ares Management, L.P. (“Ares” or the “Firm”) is a publicly traded, leading global alternative asset manager with approximately $100 billion of assets under management (“AUM”) and approximately 955 employees. Ares seeks to deliver attractive performance to its investors across its investment groups and strategies, including credit (high yield bonds, syndicated loans, structured credit, and direct lending in the U.S. and Europe), private equity (corporate private equity, U.S. power and energy infrastructure, and special situations) and real estate (debt and equity). The firm is headquartered in Los Angeles with offices across the United States, Europe and Asia. Its common units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “ARES”.

+As of March 31, 2017,  AUM amounts include funds managed by Ivy Hill Asset Management, L.P., a wholly owned portfolio company of Ares Capital Corporation and a registered investment adviser.                                




What is CADC’s Investment Strategy? 



                                    The Fund will invest primarily in a portfolio of directly originated loans, secured floating and fixed rate syndicated loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities, commercial real estate loans and other types of credit instruments.  Most credit instruments in which the fund may invest will be rated below investment grade.                                




What are the Risk Factors? 



                                    Investing in the Fund involves risks, including the risk that a Shareholder may receive little or no return on their investment or that a Shareholder may lose part or all of their investment. Below is a summary of some of the principal risks of investing in the Fund. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in the Fund, see ''Types of Investments and Related Risks.'' Shareholders should consider carefully the following principal risks before investing in the Fund:


Unlike most closed-end funds, the Fund's Shares will not be listed on any securities exchange;
Although the Fund intends to implement a quarterly share repurchase program, there is no guarantee that an investor will be able to sell all of the Shares that the investor desires to sell. The Fund should therefore be considered to offer limited liquidity;
The capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability. Such market conditions may materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets, which may have a negative impact on the Fund's business and operations;
If a Shareholder is able to sell its Shares, the Shareholder likely will receive less than its purchase price and the then current NAV per Share;
The Fund's distributions may be funded from offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to the Fund for investment. Any capital returned to Shareholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses, as well as the sales load;
A return of capital to Shareholders is a return of a portion of their original investment in the Fund, thereby reducing the tax basis of their investment. As a result from such reduction in tax basis, Shareholders may be subject to tax in connection with the sale of Fund Shares, even if such Shares are sold at a loss relative to the Shareholder's original investment;
The Fund's investments in securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing distress involve a substantial degree of risk, require a high level of analytical sophistication for successful investment, and require active monitoring;
Below investment grade instruments have predominantly speculative characteristics and may be particularly susceptible to economic downturns, which could cause losses;
Certain investments may be exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with whom the Fund deals;
The valuation of securities or instruments that lack a central trading place (such as fixed-income securities or instruments) may carry greater risk than those that trade on an exchange;
The value of convertible securities may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates, as well as the market price and volatility of the underlying security;
Derivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Fund;
The Fund may be materially adversely affected by market, economic and political conditions globally and in the jurisdictions and sectors in which the Fund invests;
Non-U.S. securities may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility and changes in value;
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of and returns on foreign denominated investments;
Credit intermediation involving entities and activities outside the regular banking system (i.e., the ''shadow banking system'' in Europe) could result in increased regulatory and operating costs, which could adversely affect the implementation of the Fund's investment strategies, income and returns;
Although the U.S. credit markets are not currently experiencing the same extreme volatility and market disruption as occurred during 2008 to 2009, extreme volatility or market disruption may recur in the future;
Legal and regulatory changes, including those implemented in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ''Dodd-Frank Act''), could occur, which may materially adversely affect the Fund;
The Fund is a newly organized, diversified, closed-end investment company with no operating history;
The Fund's ability to grow depends on its ability to raise capital;
The Fund may borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested, subjects the Fund to certain covenants with which it must comply and may increase the risk of investing with the Fund;
The Fund operates in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities;
The Fund is exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates;
The Fund's financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if a significant investment fails to perform as expected;
There are significant and potential conflicts of interest that could impact the Fund's investment returns;
To qualify and remain eligible for the special tax treatment accorded to RICs and their shareholders under the Code, the Fund must meet certain source-of-income, asset
diversification and annual distribution requirements, and failure to do so could result in the loss of RIC status.

Accordingly, the Fund should be considered a speculative investment that entails substantial risks, and a prospective investor should invest in the Fund only if they can sustain a complete loss of their investment.

The Fund has submitted to the SEC an application for an exemptive order to permit the Fund to offer multiple classes of shares. If the Fund's exemptive application is granted — there is no assurance that the SEC will do so — the Fund presently intends to offer multiple classes of shares, each of which would have different sales load and distribution and/or shareholder servicing fee structure.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

              A widely watched U.S. dollar gauge stabilized on Thursday, but still languished at a 13-month low, struggling to shake off the dovish interpretation among investors of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/​search/​search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. The Fund is a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Act as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's objective is to provide superior risk-adjusted returns across various market cycles by investing in a diversified portfolio of liquid and illiquid asset classes.
2. The Adviser, a Delaware limited liability company, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser serves as investment adviser to the Fund.
3. The applicants seek an order to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares, each having its own fee and expense structure, and to impose asset-based distribution and/or service fees, and CDSCs.
4. Applicants request that the order also apply to any other continuously offered registered closed-end management investment company existing now or in the future for which the Adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control Start Printed Page 27735with the Adviser, or its successors,[1] 
           acts as investment adviser, and which provides periodic liquidity with respect to its Shares through tender offers conducted in compliance with either rule 23c-3 under the Act or rule 13e-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”).[2] 

5. The Fund currently issues a single class of Shares (the “Initial Class Shares”). Shares are currently being offered on a continuous basis pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 at their net asset value per share plus the applicable sales load. The Fund, as a closed-end investment company, does not continuously redeem Shares as does an open-end management investment company. Shares of the Fund are not listed on any securities exchange and do not trade on an over-the-counter system such as NASDAQ. Applicants do not expect that any secondary market will ever develop for the Shares.
6. If the requested relief is granted, the Fund intends to offer multiple classes of Shares, such as the Initial Class Shares and a new Share class (the “New Class Shares”), or any other classes. Because of the different distribution fees, shareholder services fees, and any other class expenses that may be attributable to the different classes, the net income attributable to, and any dividends payable on, each class of Shares may differ from each other from time to time.
7. Applicants state that, from time to time, the Board of the Fund may create additional classes of Shares, or may vary the characteristics described of the Initial Class and New Class Shares, including without limitation, in the following respects: (1) The amount of fees permitted by different distribution plans or different service fee arrangements; (2) voting rights with respect to a distribution plan of a class; (3) different class designations; (4) the impact of any class expenses directly attributable to a particular class of Shares allocated on a class basis as described in the Application; (5) differences in any dividends and net asset values per Share resulting from differences in fees under a distribution plan or in class expenses; (6) any sales load structure; and (7) any conversion features, as permitted under the Act.
8. The Fund will not impose an “early withdrawal charge” or “repurchase fee” on investors who purchase and tender their Shares.
9. Applicants state that, in order to provide some liquidity to shareholders, the Fund is structured as an “interval fund” and makes quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of its outstanding Shares at net asset value, pursuant to rule 23c-3 under the Act, unless such offer is suspended or postponed in accordance with regulatory requirements. Any other investment company that intends to rely on the requested relief will provide periodic liquidity to shareholders in accordance with either rule 23c-3 under the Act or rule 13e-4 under the 1934 Act.
10. Applicants represent that any asset-based service and/or distribution fees will comply with the provisions of Rule 2341 of the Rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA Rule 2341”) as if that rule applied to the Fund.[3] 
           Applicants also represent that the Fund will disclose in its prospectus the fees, expenses and other characteristics of each class of Shares offered for sale by the prospectus, as is required for open-end, multiple class funds under Form N-1A. As is required for open-end funds, the Fund will disclose its expenses in shareholder reports, and describe any arrangements that result in breakpoints in sales loads in its prospectus.[4] 
           In addition, applicants will comply with applicable enhanced fee disclosure requirements for fund of funds, including registered funds of hedge funds.[5] 

11. The Fund and the Distributor will also comply with any requirements that may be adopted by the Commission or FINRA regarding disclosure at the point of sale and in transaction confirmations about the costs and conflicts of interest arising out of the distribution of open-end investment company shares, and regarding prospectus disclosure of sales loads and revenue sharing arrangements as if those requirements applied to the Fund and the Distributor. The Fund or the Distributor will contractually require that any other distributor of the Fund's Shares comply with such requirements in connection with the distribution of Shares of the Fund.
12. The Fund will allocate all expenses incurred by it among the various classes of Shares based on the net assets of the Fund attributable to each class, except that the net asset value and expenses of each class will reflect distribution fees, service fees, and any other incremental expenses of that class. Expenses of the Fund allocated to a particular class of Shares will be borne on a pro rata basis by each outstanding Share of that class. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 under the Act as if it were an open-end investment company.
13. The Fund does not intend to offer any exchange privilege or conversion feature, but any such privilege or feature introduced in the future will comply with rule 11a-1, rule 11a-3, and rule 18f-3 as if the Fund were an open-end investment company.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
Multiple Classes of Shares
1. Section 18(a)(2)(A) and (B) makes it unlawful for a registered closed-end investment company to issue a senior security that is a stock unless (a) immediately after such issuance it will have an asset coverage of at least 200% and (b) provision is made to prohibit the declaration of any distribution, upon its common stock, or the purchase of any such common stock, unless in every such case such senior security has at the time of the declaration of any such distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, an asset coverage of at least 200% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price, as the case may be. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of shares of the Funds may violate section 18(a)(2) because the Funds may not meet such requirements with respect to a class of shares that may be a senior security.
2. Section 18(c) of the Act provides, in relevant part, that a registered closed-end investment company may not issue or sell any senior security if, immediately thereafter, the company has outstanding more than one class of senior security. Applicants state that the creation of multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may be prohibited by section 18(c), as a class may have priority over another class as to payment of Start Printed Page 27736dividends because shareholders of different classes would pay different fees and expenses.
3. Section 18(i) of the Act provides that each share of stock issued by a registered management investment company will be a voting stock and have equal voting rights with every other outstanding voting stock. Applicants state that permitting multiple classes of Shares of the Fund may violate section 18(i) of the Act because each class would be entitled to exclusive voting rights with respect to matters solely related to that class.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security or transaction or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions from any provision of the Act, or from any rule or regulation under the Act, if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 18(a)(2), 18(c) and 18(i) to permit the Fund to issue multiple classes of Shares.
5. Applicants submit that the proposed allocation of expenses relating to distribution and voting rights among multiple classes is equitable and will not discriminate against any group or class of shareholders. Applicants submit that the proposed arrangements would permit the Fund to facilitate the distribution of its Shares and provide investors with a broader choice of shareholder options. Applicants assert that the proposed closed-end investment company multiple class structure does not raise the concerns underlying section 18 of the Act to any greater degree than open-end investment companies' multiple class structures that are permitted by rule 18f-3 under the Act. Applicants state that the Fund will comply with the provisions of rule 18f-3 as if it were an open-end investment company.
Asset-Based Service and/or Distribution Fees
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or joint arrangement in which the investment company participates unless the Commission issues an order permitting the transaction. In reviewing applications submitted under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the participation of the investment company in a joint enterprise or joint arrangement is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and the extent to which the participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
2. Rule 17d-3 under the Act provides an exemption from section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 to permit open-end investment companies to enter into distribution arrangements pursuant to rule 12b-1 under the Act. Applicants request an order under section 17(d) and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit the Fund to impose asset-based service and/or distribution fees. Applicants have agreed to comply with rules 12b-1 and 17d-3 as if those rules applied to closed-end investment companies, which they believe will resolve any concerns that might arise in connection with a Fund financing the distribution of its shares through asset-based service and/or distribution fees.
3. For the reasons stated above, applicants submit that the exemptions requested under section 6(c) are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants further submit that the Funds' imposition of asset-based service and/or distribution fees is consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act and does not involve participation on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Condition
The Fund agrees that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with the provisions of rules 6c-10, 12b-1, 17d-3, 18f-3, 22d-1, and where applicable, 11a-3 under the Act, as amended from time to time or replaced, as if those rules applied to closed-end management investment companies, and will comply with FINRA Rule 2341, as amended from time to time, as if that rule applied to all closed-end management investment companies.
