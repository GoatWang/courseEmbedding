Beese Fulmer can't help but make rational decisions with your investments After 35 years in business, we know it’s critical to look at the whole picture. 



When you're rational, you're more in controlOur clients are glad we don't see investing as an action-packed video game.  Our rational, deliberate approach has worked well over our 35-year history. That's why we created "The Rules of the Rational.” 






The way we workWe have a fiduciary RESPONSIBILITY to you.We BELIEVE great companies need to be purchased at the right price.Our fees are FULLY TRANSPARENT.We believe protecting your assets is an integral part of growing your wealth. This is one reason our average client relationship is more than 10 years. 






We are not like other wealth management advisors. On purpose.
We don't take on too many clients, so each portfolio manager can give careful attention to their few clients.
We don’t sell insurance, make loans or draft estate plans, but our lengthy experience working with high net worth clients has given us valuable insight on these issues.
We won't work with just any investor, so we can concentrate on high net-worth asset clients who appreciate sensible investing.
And we can't help our clients fully if we only share select information like their "highlights," so we make sure our investors see a complete and comprehensive view of all their assets.

 Beese Fulmer can concentrate on the future, because we're not thinking about making the next sale. 

Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. That's why control is so vital for successful high net-worth wealth management. Control means you stay with your portfolio manager for the long term, so your personal risk tolerance and return objectives are known AND followed. Control means your total wealth picture is more important than some fad-stock-of-the-day. And control means we stay steadfast and smart.
Because your money deserves care.

We are not like other wealth management advisors. On purpose.
You are a high net-worth individual investor. We are high net-worth wealth management experts unlike any other. Beese Fulmer understands the complexity of this type of asset management and we've put a structure and a process in place to control the complexity with rational, sensible practices. Retirement goals…risk tolerances…and income needs rule, while tax efficiencies are a given.

Each professional works with you to build an Investment strategy to help you reach your goals.

Investment portfolio consists of primarily individual stocks and bonds. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
Investment portfolios are constructed primarily using individual securities, such as stocks, bonds, and occasionally mutual funds. A portfolio consisting of individual securities increases tax efficiency, while also protecting your portfolio from the "diversification plague" (or too much diversification), which is a symptom of owning too many mutual funds.

Works with your accountant & attorney to maximize planning strategies. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
Controlling capital gains by owning individual securities is an important first step in becoming tax efficient. Professionals look at all of your accounts comprehensively and determine the best account to place each security in depending on tax status, type of trust, and retirement accounts.

Fees are with your best interests in mind. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
By having a fee that is a fixed percentage of assets under management, your account’s appreciation matters to both parties. As a result, your best interests are always at heart.

Investment strategy and track record are time tested and proven. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
Beese Fulmer is the best of both worlds. Mutual funds offer a time-tested investment philosophy, but you’re unable to have the mutual fund’s stock experts build a custom portfolio for you. Trust departments are fiduciaries and will build customized portfolios, but their investment philosophy may not be time tested and proven like a mutual fund.At Beese Fulmer, we think you should have both. We were founded in order to offer exceptional client service and build well-thought-out portfolios. At the same time, we have proof that our investment philosophy works – 34 years in business and counting.
✓
 
 
 




Investment solutions are not bound by off-site decision makers. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
We don’t receive a list of approved stocks from headquarters. We are the experts. Each portfolio manager is responsible for reviewing and monitoring companies in each sector of the economy. We build your portfolio, and we make the decisions to buy and sell. We are accountable, not headquarters.
✓
 
 
 







Small number of clients per portfolio manager. +

 
Beese Fulmer
Bank Trust Department
Brokers
Financial Planners
While our founders were working at the trust department, they found a better way. By limiting our client base to individuals, families of substantial wealth, and foundations, we are able to offer better service, build better portfolios, and better understand your goals.

 Beese Fulmer prefers rational investing to flashy gimmicks. It's just who we are. 

Who is Beese Fulmer? They are a Private Wealth Management firm founded in 1980. Dennis Fulmer and William Beese were both trust officers — and successful ones — at Harter Bank. But they wanted to focus more on helping the customer than on elevating the institution. So they left and created their own company with its own rules.
The first principle was to gain a meaningful understanding of the customer and identify their needs in every instance.
The second principle was to be unlike far too many other investors and do everything they do around rational investing.
Over 30 years later, those two principles are still in place, as solid as always, with all of their investment experts more resolute about The Rules of the Rational than ever.

Meet your team of Beese Fulmer rational investors:

Dennis co-founded the firm along with William Beese in 1980. Prior to creating the company, both served as Trust Investment Officers for Harter Bank.

Beese Fulmer can't help but make rational decisions with your investments After 35 years in business, we know it’s critical to look at the whole picture. 



When you're rational, you're more in controlOur clients are glad we don't see investing as an action-packed video game.  Our rational, deliberate approach has worked well over our 35-year history. That's why we created "The Rules of the Rational.” 






The way we workWe have a fiduciary RESPONSIBILITY to you.We BELIEVE great companies need to be purchased at the right price.Our fees are FULLY TRANSPARENT.We believe protecting your assets is an integral part of growing your wealth. This is one reason our average client relationship is more than 10 years. 






We are not like other wealth management advisors. On purpose.
We don't take on too many clients, so each portfolio manager can give careful attention to their few clients.
We don’t sell insurance, make loans or draft estate plans, but our lengthy experience working with high net worth clients has given us valuable insight on these issues.
We won't work with just any investor, so we can concentrate on high net-worth asset clients who appreciate sensible investing.
And we can't help our clients fully if we only share select information like their "highlights," so we make sure our investors see a complete and comprehensive view of all their assets.
