Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Massachusetts:













Does Douglas R. Gordon carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that involves a building's structural elements in addition to other construction, must be performed by a licensed construction supervisor, issued by the Department of Public Safety. A home improvement contractor must be registered by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, to perform any nonstructural residential home improvement work.
Douglas R. Gordon currently holds license CS-054064 (Construction Supervisor, Building Licenses), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Massachusetts?



Contractors in Massachusetts must prove continous work experience in their trade or a construction related degree from an accredited college, before they can take an exam to become a licensed contractor. Construction supervisor licenses must be renewed every 2 years, after taking the requisite continuing education requirements. 











Your liability risk when hiring Douglas R. Gordon



Contractors in Massachusetts must carry general liability insurance and an active workers' compensation policy. Proof of a current workers compensation policy is required to file a building permit as a contractor in Massachusetts. Be sure to request a copy of certificates for each policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Douglas R. Gordon



If a remodeling project has gone badly a homeowner can recoup up to $10,000 of actual losses through the Home Improvement Contractor Guaranty Fund. The property must be the owner's primary residence, and a claim must be filed within 6 months of the initial court judgement or the arbitration award date.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Massachusetts, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.

                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Suncoast Credit Union


                                            Once again Suncoast has shown itself to be a preschooler in the land of credit unions.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Doug Cloud Law – A Reputation You Can Trust
When people have a legal issue or a potential lawsuit, they often hesitate to get advice from a lawyer, too often to their detriment.  The hesitation arises from the fear of getting enmeshed in a complicated, expensive legal quagmire with no end in sight.
The only way to avoid this fear is to hire an attorney capable of evaluating your entire situation and  explaining  it to you clearly.  Clients need an attorney who can  accurately assess the risks,  costs and benefits of the various legal options available.
Doug Cloud has over 30 years experience advising and representing people in the most trying situations of their lives. He has represented people who have lost loved ones to a physician’s or hospital’s errors or those who have suffered horrible injuries as a result of prescription drugs.  He has represented those wrongfully charged with crimes as well as those suffering the agony of a breaking marriage.  He has represented whistle blowers who have refused to stand by and be party to their employer’s unethical and fraudulent actions.  He has represented consumers cheated out of their home’s equity by unscrupulous builders or mortgage brokers.  He has obtained compensation for people injured by defective products such as vehicles prone to rollovers or  poorly designed appliances prone to causing house fires.
Doug has achieved outstanding results in all of  the common situations in which ordinary people need legal representation. His  wide legal experience allows him to spot issues and solutions many other attorneys can’t identify that may pertain to a client’s legal issue.
He knows that people can understand and make the right decisions, but only if they have a full understanding of their legal situation and the risks and opportunities each legal strategy entails.
Doug can tell you when you need to fight for justice, and when you need to be practical.  But, he also knows that before he can advise you to do anything he first has to listen to you.   Every person has a different case and a different personality.  Each client is an  individual who needs a careful consideration of his or her specific legal problem.
If you would like a free initial consultation to have Doug discuss your legal issue with you, please don’t hesitate to call today.
