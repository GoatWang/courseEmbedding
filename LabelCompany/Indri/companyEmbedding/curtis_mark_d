Epub 2009 May 18.September 2009The screening of enhancer detector lines in Arabidopsis thaliana has identified genes that are specifically expressed in the sporophytic tissue of the ovule. One such gene is the MADS-domain transcription factor AGAMOUS-LIKE6 (AGL6), which is expressed asymmetrically in the endothelial layer of the ovule, adjacent to the developing haploid female gametophyte. Transcription of AGL6 is regulated at multiple stages of development by enhancer and silencer elements located in both the upstream regulatory region and the large first intron. These include a bipartite enhancer, which requires elements in both the upstream regulatory region and the first intron, active in the endothelium. Transcription of the AGL13 locus, which encodes the other member of the AGL6 subfamily in Arabidopsis, is also regulated by elements located in the upstream regulatory region and in the first intron. There is, however, no overlapping expression of AGL6 and AGL13 except in the chalaza of the developing ovule, as was shown using a dual gene reporter system. Phylogenetic shadowing of the first intron of AGL6 and AGL13 homologs from other Brassicaceae identified four regions of conservation that probably contain the binding sites of transcriptional regulators, three of which are conserved outside Brassicaceae. Further phylogenetic analysis using the protein-encoding domains of AGL6 and AGL13 revealed that the MADS DNA-binding domain shows considerable divergence. Together, these results suggest that AGL6 and AGL13 show signs of subfunctionalization, with divergent expression patterns, regulatory sequences and possibly functions.Authors: Mark Curtis, Stephen Schauer, Philipp M. Schlüter, Ramarmurthy Baskar, Jacqueline Gheyselinck, Arturo Bolanos, Ueli GrossniklausA versatile and reliable two-component system for tissue-specific gene induction in Arabidopsis.Plant Physiol.August 2006Developmental progression and differentiation of distinct cell types depend on the regulation of gene expression in space and time. Tools that allow spatial and temporal control of gene expression are crucial for the accurate elucidation of gene function. Most systems to manipulate gene expression allow control of only one factor, space or time, and currently available systems that control both temporal and spatial expression of genes have their limitations. We have developed a versatile two-component system that overcomes these limitations, providing reliable, conditional gene activation in restricted tissues or cell types. This system allows conditional tissue-specific ectopic gene expression and provides a tool for conditional cell type- or tissue-specific complementation of mutants. The chimeric transcription factor XVE, in conjunction with Gateway recombination cloning technology, was used to generate a tractable system that can efficiently and faithfully activate target genes in a variety of cell types. Six promoters/enhancers, each with different tissue specificities (including vascular tissue, trichomes, root, and reproductive cell types), were used in activation constructs to generate different expression patterns of XVE. Conditional transactivation of reporter genes was achieved in a predictable, tissue-specific pattern of expression, following the insertion of the activator or the responder T-DNA in a wide variety of positions in the genome. Expression patterns were faithfully replicated in independent transgenic plant lines. Results demonstrate that we can also induce mutant phenotypes using conditional ectopic gene expression. One of these mutant phenotypes could not have been identified using noninducible ectopic gene expression approaches.Authors: Lukas Brand, Hörler M, Nüesch E, Vassalli S, Barrell P, Yang W, Jefferson RA, Grossniklaus U, Mark CurtisIdentification of positive GATEWAY expression clones when both the pENTRY and pDEST vectors contain the same marker for bacterial selection.CSH Protoc.November 2006GATEWAY cloning technology (Invitrogen) takes advantage of bacteriophage λ site-specific recombination. The life cycle of λ alternates between the lytic and lysogenic stages. DNA can be inserted or excised from the Escherichia coli host genome by recombination between specific sites, AttB (bacterial) and AttP (phage). This process is mediated by the λ proteins int (integrase) and xis (excisionase), and a host protein IHF (integration host factor). GATEWAY cloning technology uses this process to insert fragments of DNA directionally into specially adapted vectors. These vectors contain a negative selectable marker, the ccdB gene, to select against nonrecombinant clones. Promoter or gene fragments are made GATEWAY compatible with adapter primers and amplified by PCR. These fragments are used in a BP clonase reaction to create ENTRY clones. Usually the pDONR vector used to generate such ENTRY clones is chosen so that the antibiotic selection marker is different from that of the pDEST vector, which finally generates an expression clone. This favors the selection of the expression clone and selects against the pENTRY clone. Now that many pENTRY and pDEST vectors have been generated and made available in stock centers, the antibiotic resistance genes are predetermined and may not always be compatible with each other. This problem is frequently experienced by plant researchers, since many full-length cDNA libraries have been generated using the pDONR-TOPO, pDONR221, or pENTR1A vectors, which are all kanamycin resistant in bacteria, and many pDEST vectors have been adapted from conventional plant transformation vectors, which are also frequently kanamycin resistant in bacteria. The following protocol describes ways in which such difficult vector combinations can be used effectively to obtain the appropriate expression clone without having to convert the pENTRY clone or pDEST clone to vectors with compatible antibiotic resistances.Authors: Basherudin N, Mark CurtisDisruption of AtMRP4, a guard cell plasma membrane ABCC-type ABC transporter, leads to deregulation of stomatal opening and increased drought susceptibility.Plant J.July 2004ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane proteins responsible for cellular detoxification processes in plants and animals. Recent evidence shows that this class of transporters may also be involved in many other cellular processes. Because of their homology with human multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP), cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR), some plant ABC transporters have been implicated in the regulation of ion channel activities. This paper describes an investigation of the AtMRP4 gene and its role in stomatal regulation. Reporter gene studies showed that AtMRP4 is highly expressed in stomata and that the protein is localized to the plasma membrane. Stomatal aperture in three independent atmrp4 mutant alleles was larger than in wild-type plants, both in the light and in the dark, resulting in increased water loss but no change in the photosynthetic rate. In baker's yeast, AtMRP4 shows ATP-dependent, vanadate-sensitive transport of methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate and a substrate of mammalian MRPs. Treatment with MTX reduced stomatal opening in wild-type plants, but had no effect in atmrp4 mutants. These results indicate the involvement of AtMRP4 in the complex regulation of stomatal aperture.Authors: Markus Klein, Geisler M, Suh SJ, Kolukisaoglu HU, Azevedo L, Plaza S, Mark Curtis, Richter A, Weder B, Schulz B, Martinoia EApomixis technology development-virgin births in farmers' fields?Nat Biotechnol.June 2004Apomixis is the process of asexual reproduction through seed, in the absence of meiosis and fertilization, generating clonal progeny of maternal origin. Major benefits to agriculture could result from harnessing apomixis in crop plants. Although >400 apomictic plant species are known, apomixis is rare among crop plants, and the transfer of apomixis to crop varieties by conventional breeding has been largely unsuccessful. Because apomictic and sexual pathways are closely related, de novo engineering of apomixis might be achieved in sexually reproducing crops. Early consideration of issues relating to biosafety and intellectual property (IP) management can facilitate the acceptance and deployment of apomixis technology in agriculture.Authors: Mark Curtis, Charlie Spillane, Ueli GrossniklausA gateway cloning vector set for high-throughput functional analysis of genes in planta.Plant Physiol.October 2003The current challenge, now that two plant genomes have been sequenced, is to assign a function to the increasing number of predicted genes. In Arabidopsis, approximately 55% of genes can be assigned a putative function, however, less than 8% of these have been assigned a function by direct experimental evidence. To identify these functions, many genes will have to undergo comprehensive analyses, which will include the production of chimeric transgenes for constitutive or inducible ectopic expression, for antisense or dominant negative expression, for subcellular localization studies, for promoter analysis, and for gene complementation studies. The production of such transgenes is often hampered by laborious conventional cloning technology that relies on restriction digestion and ligation. With the aim of providing tools for high throughput gene analysis, we have produced a Gateway-compatible Agrobacterium sp. binary vector system that facilitates fast and reliable DNA cloning. This collection of vectors is freely available, for noncommercial purposes, and can be used for the ectopic expression of genes either constitutively or inducibly. The vectors can be used for the expression of protein fusions to the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein and to the beta-glucuronidase protein so that the subcellular localization of a protein can be identified. They can also be used to generate promoter-reporter constructs and to facilitate efficient cloning of genomic DNA fragments for complementation experiments. All vectors were derived from pCambia T-DNA cloning vectors, with the exception of a chemically inducible vector, for Agrobacterium sp.-mediated transformation of a wide range of plant species.Authors: Mark Curtis, Ueli GrossniklausAsymmetric leaves1 mediates leaf patterning and stem cell function in Arabidopsis.NatureDecember 2000Meristem function in plants requires both the maintenance of stem cells and the specification of founder cells from which lateral organs arise. Lateral organs are patterned along proximodistal, dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. Here we show that the Arabidopsis mutant asymmetric leaves1 (as1) disrupts this process. AS1 encodes a myb domain protein, closely related to PHANTASTICA in Antirrhinum and ROUGH SHEATH2 in maize, both of which negatively regulate knotted-class homeobox genes. AS1 negatively regulates the homeobox genes KNAT1 and KNAT2 and is, in turn, negatively regulated by the meristematic homeobox gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS. This genetic pathway defines a mechanism for differentiating between stem cells and organ founder cells within the shoot apical meristem and demonstrates that genes expressed in organ primordia interact with meristematic genes to regulate shoot morphogenesis.Authors: Byrne ME, Barley R, Mark Curtis, Arroyo JM, Dunham M, Hudson A, Martienssen RAThe promoter of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2 from Arabidopsis is systemically activated by fungal pathogens and responds to methyl jasmonate but not to salicylic acid.Plant Mol Biol.December 1998The plant defensin PDF1.2 has previously been shown to accumulate systemically via a salicylic acid-independent pathway in leaves of Arabidopsis upon challenge by fungal pathogens. To further investigate the signalling and transcriptional processes underlying plant defensin induction, a DNA fragment containing 1184 bp and 1232 bp upstream of the transcriptional and translational start sites, respectively, was cloned by inverse PCR. To test for promoter activity this DNA fragment was linked to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS)-encoding region of the UidA gene as a translational fusion and introduced into Arabidopsis ecotype C-24. Challenge of the transgenic plants with the fungal pathogens Alternaria brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea resulted in both local and systemic induction of the reporter gene. Wounding of the transgenic plants had no effect on GUS activity. Treatment of the transgenic plants with either jasmonates or the active oxygen generating compound paraquat strongly induced the reporter gene. In contrast, neither salicylate nor its functional analogues 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid and 1,2,3-benzothiodiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester resulted in reporter gene induction. These results are consistent with the existence of a salicylic acid-independent signalling pathway, possibly involving jasmonates as regulators, that is triggered by pathogen challenge but not by wounding. The transgenic plants containing the PDF1.2-based promoter-reporter construct will provide useful tools for future genetic dissection of this novel systemic signalling pathway.Authors: Manners JM,, Penninckx IA, Vermaere K, Kazan K, Brown RL, Morgan A, Maclean DJ, Mark Curtis, Cammue BP, Broekaert WFA peroxidase gene promoter induced by phytopathogens and methyl jasmonate in transgenic plants.Mol Plant Microbe Interact.April 1997The expression of two closely related peroxidase isogenes, Shpx6a and Shpx6b, of the legume Stylosanthes humilis was studied using isogene-specific reverse transcriptase PCR techniques. Results indicated that transcripts of both genes were rapidly induced following inoculation with the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, wounding and treatment with the defense regulator methyl jasmonate (MeJA). In contrast treatment of leaves of S. humilis with abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) did not induce transcripts of either isogene. A genomic clone containing the Shpx6b gene was isolated and 594 bp of 5' sequence upstream of the translation start was fused in frame to the coding region of the uidA reporter gene and introduced into tobacco. Expression from the Shpx6b promoter in transgenic plants was determined by histochemical staining and quantitative assays of beta-glucuronidase (GUS).Authors: Mark Curtis, Rae AL, Rusu AG, Harrison SJ, Manners JM.Gypsy-class retrotransposon sequences in organisms related to the leaf mould fungus, Cladosporium fulvum.Microbiol Res.May 1996Gypsy retrotransposons are a major branch of retroid elements and have been found in a wide diversity of eukaryotic organisms including CfT-1 in the tomato leaf mould pathogen, the fungus Cladosporium fulvum (syn. Fulvia fulva). We have examined organisms that are either ecologically or phylogenetically related to C. fulvum, for elements related to CfT-1. Using PCR and Southern hybridisation, similar sequences were found only in the co-genic fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides. This finding confirms the apparent ubiquity of retroelements, suggests that the phylogeny of retrotransposons is consistent with the phylogeny of their hosts and argues against frequent horizontal gene transfer.Authors: Mark Curtis, Oliver R.P.Nucleotide sequence of a cationic peroxidase gene from the tropical forage legume Stylosanthes humilis.Plant Physiol.July 1995Authors: Mark Curtis, Nourse JP, Manners JM.Differential expression of peroxidase isogenes during the early stages of infection of the tropical forage legume Stylosanthes humilis by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.Mol Plant Microbe Interact.May 1995Infection of Stylosanthes humilis by the fungal phytopathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is associated with an increase in peroxidase enzyme activity within 24 h postinoculation. Peroxidase gene expression was investigated as a first step towards understanding the regulation and functional importance of this host response to fungal attack. Four distinct cDNAs Shpx 2, 5, 6, and 12, isolated from a cDNA library of S. humilis contained deduced amino acid (aa) sequence motifs characteristic of peroxidases. Three of these (Shpx 2, 5, and 6) were full-length and their deduced proteins each fell into a different homology group based on comparisons with other plant peroxidases. Each cDNA appeared to hybridize to only one or two genes in S. humilis. mRNAs corresponding to Shpx2, Shpx6, and Shpx12 were expressed relatively abundantly in young leaves, with lesser expression of Shpx2 and Shpx6 and no expression of Shpx12 detected in roots. No expression of these genes was detected in stems or old leaves. The mRNA of Shpx5 was relatively abundant in stems and to a lesser extent in young leaves. However, infection of young leaves with C. gloeosporioides greatly increased expression of the mRNAs of Shpx2 and Shpx6 but not Shpx5 nor Shpx12 compared to mock-inoculated controls. The mRNA of Shpx6 was strongly induced by the pathogen 4 h postinoculation, a time which precedes fungal penetration, while Shpx2 was induced to higher levels than controls at 24 h after inoculation. The mRNAs of both Shpx2 and Shpx6 but not Shpx5 and Shpx12 were also induced by wounding.Authors: Harrison SJ, Mark Curtis, McIntyre CL, Maclean DJ, Manners JMMolecular evidence that diploid Stylosanthes humilis and diploid Stylosanthes hamata are progenitors of allotetraploid Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano.Genome.April 1995Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, using peroxidase, O-methyltransferase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, and coniferyl alcohol dehydrogenase cDNAs isolated from Stylosanthes humilis, as probes, provided molecular evidence for the genetic origin of the naturally occuring allotetraploid genotype Stylosanthes hamata cv. Verano (2n = 4x = 40). Hybridization patterns strongly suggest that the likely progenitors of S. hamata cv. Verano were a diploid S. humilis (2n = 2x = 20) and a diploid S. hamata (2n = 2x = 20) species.Authors: Mark Curtis, Cameron DF, Manners JMhe phylogeny of the tomato leaf mould fungus Cladosporium fulvum syn. Fulvia fulva by analysis of rDNA sequences.Curr Genet.April 1994The nucleotide sequence of part of the ribosomal DNA from races of the fungal tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum and other Cladosporium species have been determined. Comparisons of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) of several C. fulvum races showed complete sequence homology suggesting a recent evolutionary divergence. Comparisons of these nucleotide sequences in the ITS region with those of other Cladosporium species showed the close relationship within the Cladosporium genus. Using the nucleotide sequence of part of the 18s ribosomal subunit from these isolates and comparing them with sequences of some Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Chytridiomycetes, obtained from GenBank, we infer the phylogeny of the Cladosporium species studied here. Our analysis shows that the Cladosporia form a monophyletic group which falls within the order Ascomycotina.Authors: Mark Curtis, Gore J, Oliver RPInvestigation of the specificity of the interaction between colicin E9 and its immunity protein by site-directed mutagenesis.Mol Microbiol.November 1991Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the C-terminal domain of three DNAase type E colicins has identified six candidate specificity determinants for the interaction of these E colicins with their homologous immunity proteins. We have changed these candidate specificity determinants of colicin E9, using site-directed mutagenesis, to the corresponding amino-acids of colicin E8. A 'mutant'​ colicin E9, in which four of the six candidate specificity determinants have been changed, demonstrated colicin activity against Escherichia coli indicator strains which carried either the E8imm or the E9imm genes, indicative of a 'novel'​ E. colicin. After changing all six of the candidate specificity determinants, the resulting colicin E9 'mutant' exhibited a phenotype very similar to that of colicin E8.Authors: Mark Curtis, James RAn evolutionary relationship between the ColE5-099 and the ColE9-J plasmids revealed by nucleotide sequencing.J Gen Microbiol.October 1989The nucleotide sequence of a 1124 bp fragment of the ColE5-099 plasmid which encodes colicin E5 immunity, a lys gene involved in colicin release from the host cell, and the 3' end of the colicin E5 structural gene has been determined. Open reading frames corresponding to the three genes have been located by analogy with similar sequences from other E colicin plasmids. The location of these open reading frames corresponds with the position of the genes as determined by subcloning and transposon mutagenesis. The amino acid sequence of the carboxy-terminal 107 amino acid residues of the colicin E5 gene shows no homology with any other E colicin, suggesting a different mode of action in killing sensitive cells. A comparison of the nucleotide sequence of this region of the ColE5-099 plasmid with that of the equivalent region of the ColE9-J plasmid suggests a close evolutionary relationship between these two plasmids.Authors: Mark Curtis, James R, Coddington AThale Cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) GenomeWileySeptember 2006The genome of the Thale Cress, Arabidopsis thaliana , was the first plant genome to be fully sequenced, providing a tool for the rapid characterization of biological processes. This versatile model organism has had a major impact on our understanding of the physiology, growth, and development of flowering plants, and their response to environmental stress. An in-depth understanding of model organisms, coupled with knowledge of crop systems, will provide rapid advancements in technology, including genetic engineering, that are required to overcome future predicted global climate changes and short falls in food production.Authors: Mark Curtis, Ueli GrossniklausRecombinant DNA, Vector Design, and ConstructionWileyOctober 2007Genomics, biotechnology, and biology in general have been enabled by methodologies to manipulate DNA in a test tube (a very tiny test tube). Restriction enzymes are used as molecular scissors, ligases are used as molecular "glue." The polymerase chain reaction has become invaluable in amplifying and cloning DNA. In addition, recombination systems have been developed as alternatives to restriction enzymes as cloning tools. All these methods are useful in creating plasmids containing chimeric DNA constructs that will be transformed into plants.Authors: Mark CurtisPlant Genetics and DevelopmentWileySeptember 2007Our understanding of nearly all aspects of plant growth and development have benefited from the application of genetic analyses. Early anatomical and physiological studies provided evidence for processes that allow the plant to respond to internal and external stimuli, but genetics has provided the tools to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The development of new tools in molecular genetics, the adoption of plant model organisms and the creation of databases for comparative gene analyses, have all contributed to the rapid progress in our understanding of plant developmental biology in recent years.Authors: Mark Curtis, Ueli GrossniklausPower electronics applications in utilitiesABB ReviewDecember 2010The power sector is changing rapidly due to ever increasing levels of electricity consumption, increased use of alternative, often remote, energy sources, and a greater focus on energy efficiency and grid reliability. Developments in power semiconductors and the use of this technology in various power-electronics-based applications are facilitating many of these changes. Power electronic are the key building blocks of power-electronics-based switching devices that control the flow of electricity and convert it to the wave form and frequency required for different applications.

Each new design requires a variety of unique, train specific components that are supplied by additional independent original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Traditionally the traction motor is among the many custom made components required by trainmanufacturers. These motors are intensively engineered to ensure function and quality, which results in increased complexity throughout the value chain and adversely affects their manufacturing lead time. To overcome these problems, ABB has developed a new range of induction traction motors with built-in flexibility so that customer-specific requirementscan be met using a single modular design.
