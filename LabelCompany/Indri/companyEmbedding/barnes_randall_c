Overview



The peerless and comprehensive survey of this important American artist, now available in paperback for the first timeThis thoroughly researched, immensely readable study on Winslow Homer, one of America's most significant and prolific painters, presents a full account of his life and work and offers a fresh and provocative reassessment of his place in the history of late nineteenth-century art. Homer's work is popular and accessible, and Griffin's text, with its solid documentation, original research and fresh interpretations, has become an essential survey of Homer and his creative output.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"[An] excellent overview... All the paintings that secured [Homer’s] place in the very top flight of 19th C. American artists are excellently reproduced, together with many of his boating and lsquo;outdoors’ watercolours, which some fans prefer even to the oils for their freshness and immediacy."—Galleries"Professor Randall C. Griffin of Southern Methodist University has provided a fresh insight into a man whose complex life and art have been examined and dissected more than any other American artist... Congratulations to the Phaidon Press for excellent production and reproduction values."—The Falmouth Enterprise"This is recommended for all libraries for holdings in American art history."—Library Journal"The book itself is a work of art."—Les Scott, BBC Radio Stoke

Library Journal
It is seemingly not possible to have too many books devoted to  iconic American artist Winslow Homer. In the past decade,  scholars have examined the minutiae of Homer's life, revealing  internal and external influences, conscious and unconscious  motives, and every social and cultural stimulus that might have  shaped his art. Added to this considerable mass of scholarship  is a new monograph by Griffin (art history, Southern Methodist  Univ.; Homer, Eakins & Anshutz: The Search for American Identity  in the Gilded Age). What can Griffin possibly add to this flood  of information? The answer is an eminently readable text that  considers past scholarly discourses but, ultimately, like  Nicolai Cikosky and Franklin Kelly's groundbreaking catalog,  Winslow Homer, looks at the artist through the entire range of  art he created. Griffin reemphasizes Homer's European and  Japanese influences and adds revealing insights into the  artist's use of pop-culture imagery in his works. With 140-plus  color and 50 black-and-white images, this is recommended for all  libraries with holdings in American art history.-Kraig  Binkowski, Yale Ctr. for British Art   Copyright 2006 Reed Business Information.

      Sidelights
    

      In the late 1990s, Brenda Barnes shocked the business world by leaving her
      high-profile position as the highest-ranking female executive at Pepsi Co.
      to devote her time and attention to her family. While she occasionally
      worked over the next few years, it was not until 2004 that she
      whole-heartedly returned to the corporate world. At that time, she became
      an executive at Sara Lee Corporation, and soon launched a re-structuring
      of the company.
    

      Born around 1955, Barnes was raised in Chicago, the daughter of a father
      who worked as a maintenance man at International Harvester and the
      granddaughter of Polish immigrants. She and her six siblings gained strong
      values from their parents, including the value of humbleness. Barnes told
      Shelley Donald Coolidge of the 
      
        Christian Science Monitor
      
      , "My parents gave me a strong work ethic and the ability to listen
      to people and value what they have to say and do. That base foundation of
      values helped me tremendously."
    

      She earned her undergraduate degree in business and economics from
      Rockford, Illinois' Augustana College in 1975. With no job
      prospects, she spent 
      the next year working variously as a waitress, post office mail sorter,
      and clothing salesperson. Barnes began her professional career at PepsiCo,
      Inc. in 1976, when she was hired as a business manager for Wilson Sporting
      Goods, which was then a division of Pepsi. While Barnes experienced gender
      discrimination at the male-dominated company, she was determined to do her
      job and reach her goal of becoming head of sales. Barnes also entered
      Loyola University, from which she graduated with her M.B.A. in 1978.
    

      Barnes remained with Wilson Sporting Goods until 1981, when she moved to
      another PepsiCo company, Frito-Lay. There, she served as vice president of
      marketing. In 1984, Barnes went to Pepsi-USA, where she moved into sales
      on the advice of her mentor to further her career down the line. In 1988,
      Barnes was named the vice president of national sales and marketing at
      Pepsi.
    

      In January of 1992, Barnes was named president of Pepsi-Cola South. In
      this post, she was responsible for overseeing all manufacturing, sales,
      and distribution of Pepsi products for 13 states in the South. Her
      promotion made her the most senior female executive at the Pepsi-Cola
      Company, a division of PepsiCo. Less than two years later, in September of
      1993, she was named chief operating officer of Pepsi-Cola Company. Barnes
      was responsible for overseeing the manufacture, sales, and distribution of
      Pepsi products in 24 states.
    

      In 1996, Barnes was named president and chief executive officer of
      Pepsi-Cola North America, PepsiCo's North American division and the
      largest beverage division of the company. Again the highest-ranking female
      executive in PepsiCo as well as one of the top women executives in the
      United States, she remained in the post for two years. Her division had
      strong sales and profits, and she was known for her exceptional ability to
      build brand identity. In 1996, the company had sales of $7.73 billion and
      operating profits of $1.43 billion. After warning the company head that
      her tenure in the post might be short-lived, she resigned in September of
      1997, and officially left the company at the end of the year.
    

      The reason for her resignation from the company where she spent 22 years
      of her career was simple: Barnes wanted to spend more time with her three
      still-young children and her husband. The demands of her position limited
      the amount of time she saw her growing children as well her husband, who
      had resigned from his own executive position at PepsiCo in April of 1996
      to spend time with their children. For nine years of marriage, Barnes and
      her husband also had to live in separate cities because of the demands of
      their careers; they commuted back and forth to see each other.
    

      When Barnes resigned, she told Dottie Enrico of 
      
        USA Today
      
      , "There was no pivotal event that led me to this decision.
      It's something I've struggled with for a long time. It was
      easier when the kids were babies, but now I'm sometimes faced with
      having only a few minutes a day to spend with each of my children and my
      husband. The time has come to devote 100 percent of my time to
      them."
    

      In her last position at Pepsi-Cola, Barnes had a 70-hour work week. An
      average workday lasted from 3:30 a.m., when she began working at home so
      she could later have breakfast with her children, to 7:30 p.m., when she
      returned home. She usually had to spend two or three nights a week away
      from home as well, though she refused to do more than a very limited
      amount of work on weekends. The demands of the job, to which she wanted to
      give all it deserved, meant that she missed many of her children's
      birthdays, school plays, and other important events.
    

      While PepsiCo made offers like a flexible schedule, a leave of absence,
      fewer responsibilities, or even a new position with the company, Barnes
      decided that she needed to move on. She commented to the 
      
        Christian Science Monitor
      
      's Coolidge shortly before she left, "The job I have is a
      wonderful job and exciting and thrilling. The people here are wonderful,
      and I get a lot of satisfaction. So I love what I do. But it's not
      a bad choice, to leave one thing you love to go to another thing you
      love."
    

      Barnes' decision was shocking to many in corporate America and seen
      as indicative of a developing trend of the decade. Many couples in which
      both partners had demanding careers were experiencing burnout and looking
      for changes in corporate culture. Family time gained importance for a
      number of executives as balancing demanding careers and personal lives
      became more vital.
    

      Barnes looked forward not only to having time with her family, but also a
      chance to develop personal interests like cooking, computer skills,
      reading, and even exercising for the first time in a decade. While her
      family became her primary focus as they moved back to her hometown of
      Chicago, she kept her hand in the corporate world in several ways. She
      continued to serve as a member of the board of di-
      rectors of seven companies. She began a tenure on Avon's board in
      1994 and also served on the board of Sears, Roebuck & Company. In
      1998, Barnes joined the board of the New York Times Company, the parent
      company of the 
      
        New York Times
      
      , and later also took on the same post at Staples, Inc.
    

      In addition, Barnes took on a temporary executive position and was active
      in education-related opportunities. When Starwood Hotels and Resorts
      realigned their senior management structure after planning to get out from
      the gaming business, Barnes was hired as the company's interim
      president. She was charged not only with managing Starwood's
      operations, but also helping find a new president and chief operating
      officer. Barnes remained in the post from November 1999 to March 2000. Two
      years later, Barnes worked as an adjunct professor at both the Kellogg
      Graduate School of Business and North Central College. She served as a
      member of the board of trustees for Augustana College and the Steering
      Committee for Kellogg Center for Executive Women as well.
    

      In the early 2000s, Barnes was ready to return to full-time corporate
      work, while remaining on the boards of Avon, Sears, New York Times
      Company, and Staples. Such experiences prepared her for going back. Barnes
      told Don Babwin of the Associated Press State & Local Wire,
      "I've been very plugged into the business world in very
      different ways. I have been very active, and I think I have been able to
      see business from a lot of different industries."
    

      Barnes was hired by Chicago-based Sara Lee Corporation in May of 2004 and
      officially began her tenure in July of 2004. Her son, Brian, believed she
      needed to be employed again. He told Eric Herman of the 
      
        Chicago Sun-Times
      
      , "My mom was wondering if by going back to work we'd miss
      her, and we joked that we saw her too much. I think it's great. She
      was getting bored at home, and I think this is exactly what she
      wanted." Initially, Barnes served as a member of Sara Lee's
      board of directors, president, and chief operating officer for the
      company, which manufactured and sold food and beverage products, branded
      apparel, and household products worldwide as well as maintained a large
      foodservice business which catered to food distributors, cafeterias, and
      restaurants.
    

      Only a short time later, in February of 2005, Barnes was promoted to
      president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Sara Lee. At the time of
      her promotion, Sara Lee was undergoing a substantial reorganization which
      Barnes played a significant role in initiating. Earnings in fiscal 2004
      were flat, and the company was making bold but risky plans to sell or spin
      off its $4.5 billion apparel business to concentrate on food, beverage,
      household, and body items as well as its foodservice business. Both moves
      were initially supported by Wall Street, though by divesting apparel
      interests, the company would be losing brands which accounted for 40
      percent of its total revenue. Barnes believed the change would both
      simplify and make operations better, resulting in the same profits on
      smaller revenue five years down the line. It would also better focus sales
      for retailers as it was believed that Sara Lee had too many items to offer
      from multiple sales forces.
    

      In October of 2005, Barnes was promoted again, when she was named chairman
      for Sara Lee. The move made Barnes in charge of the largest female-run
      company in the Fortune 500. While Barnes' restructuring of Sara Lee
      was initially seen as a positive, Sara Lee stock prices dropped 23 percent
      during the first year of her tenure as CEO, and both shareholders and some
      on Wall Street expressed their doubts about her plans. One criticism was
      that the apparel companies were not being sold for a high enough price to
      create long-term cash flow, while others bemoaned the lack of new products
      being introduced.
    

      Barnes was aware that she faced pressure in this situation. She told 
      
        USA Today
      
      's Del Jones, "I feel all the weight of the world. The
      clock's ticking, and I'm very aware of that. It's
      been intense. It will continue to be intense." Yet Barnes also
      admitted to Jones, "I set a high bar for myself and others, and I
      think I help people get over that bar. That's my job." In
      her defense, she believed the strategy was going according to plan and the
      numbers forecast in 2005 were on track for 2006. Barnes pointed out that a
      foundation was being laid for a stronger, leaner Sara Lee.
    

      By early 2007, rising profits for the company proved Sara Lee was turning
      the corner and analysts agreed with Barnes' assessment of forward
      progress. However, no matter what happens with Sara Lee, Barnes'
      ultimate goal was both professional and personal. She told Jones of 
      
        USA Today
      
      , "I would love to demonstrate to the world that a woman can run a
      company well."

    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings.
