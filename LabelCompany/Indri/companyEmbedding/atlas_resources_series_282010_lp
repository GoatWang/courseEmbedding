Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 L.P. ("we", "us", or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on April 1, 2010 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; NYSE: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of ARP's general partner interest.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Indiana, and Colorado. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  � well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  � reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  � preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $72,700 of net production revenues for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and the first six months of 2015, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,631 $ 5,323 $ 3,997 $ 10,883 Production volumes: Gas (Mcf/day) (1) 10,355 13,213 10,064 12,922 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per Mcf) (1) (3) $ 1.90 $ 4.45 $ 2.36 $ 4.67 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 78 % 32 % 59 % 29 % Per Mcfe (1) $ 1.35 $ 1.41 $ 1.29 $ 1.35 Depletion per Mcfe $ 0.69 $ 1.44 $ 0.68 $ 1.47 _  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "Mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to Mcfe using the ratio of six Mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $155,400 and $23,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Previously recognized derivative gains were $301,400 and $44,100 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $1,631,400 and $5,322,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $3,691,100 (69%). The $3,691,100 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $2,539,800 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $1,151,200 decrease in a production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 10,355 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 13,213 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 2,858 Mcf per day (22%). The decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted mostly from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Our natural gas revenues were $3,997,300 and $10,883,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $6,885,700 (63%). The $6,885,700 decrease in natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $4,479,200 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $2,406,500 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 10,064 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 12,922 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 2,858 Mcf per day (22%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $1,276,400 and $1,697,100 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $420,700 (25%). Production expenses were $2,352,600 and $3,165,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $812,800 (26%). The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 were mostly due to lower transportation costs due to a decrease in the realized price of natural gas.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 40% and 32% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 31% and 32% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $35,000 and $27,400, respectively, an increase of $7,600 (28%). For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, these expenses were $69,200 and $62,500, respectively, an increase of $6,700 (11%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The increases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $3,537,700 in the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $2,974,300 as compared to $6,512,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income before depletion and accretion of $5,907,300, a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $68,000 and a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $18,800. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $2,371,400 and an increase in non-cash loss on derivative value of $85,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Cash provided by investing activities decreased $272,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $150,000 from $422,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was due to a change in proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of $255,700 and a decrease of $17,000 related to the purchase of tangible equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $5,067,400 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $3,124,300 from $8,191,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through June 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $72,700 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on April 1, 2010 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, -1.08%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Michigan, Indiana, and Colorado. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  · well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  · reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  · preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of September 30, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 5,319 $ 7,550 $ 19,198 $ 19,166 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 14,607 24,887 17,274 22,836 Average sales prices (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 4.03 $ 3.38 $ 4.14 $ 3.16 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 33 % 41 % 30 % 36 % Per mcfe (1) $ 1.30 $ 1.34 $ 1.24 $ 1.11 Depletion per mcfe $ 2.38 $ 0.96 $ 1.83 $ 1.60  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcf to one bbl.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $5,319,400 and $7,549,800 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2,230,400 (30%). The $2,230,400 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $3,118,600 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $888,200 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 14,607 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2013 from 24,887 mcf per day for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of 10,280 mcf per day (41%). The decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted mostly from the normal decline inherent in the life of the Partnership's Marcellus wells.  Our natural gas revenues were $19,198,200 and $19,166,400 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $31,800 (.02%). The $31,800 increase in natural gas revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $4,753,000 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $4,721,200 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 17,274 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 from 22,836 mcf per day for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of 5,562 mcf per day (24%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $1,750,000 and $3,073,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $1,323,000 (43%). Production expenses were $5,825,900 and $6,918,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $1,092,300 (16%). The decreases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were mostly due to lower transportation fees.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 46% and 51% for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and 45% and 52% for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 were $39,800 and $41,200, respectively, a decrease of $1,400 (3%). For the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 these expenses were $118,300 and $115,900, respectively, an increase of $2,400 (2%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The changes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities increased $7,160,700 in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to $13,957,800 as compared to $6,797,100 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in the change in accounts receivable trade- affiliate of $5,661,500 and an increase in net income before depletion and accretion of $1,121,700. In addition, the change in accrued liabilities increased operating activities by $652,500. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in the non-cash loss on hedge instruments of $275,000, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2012.  Cash provided by investing activities was $2,300 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, resulting from the net of $14,800 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $12,500 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities increased $7,534,500 during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to $15,664,100 from $8,129,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. This increase was due to an increase in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Investor Alert:  Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP




(Last Updated On: May 18, 2016)Have you suffered investment losses in Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.
According to their website, Atlas Resource Partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors.  The company often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP.  These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP, is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Atlas Resource Partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commission brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Atlas Resources Series 28-2010 LP or another Atlas Resource Partners private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
