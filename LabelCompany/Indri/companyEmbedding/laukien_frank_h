Movers & Shakers Interview - Frank H. Laukien, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bruker Daltonics Inc.

Movers & Shakers Interview - Frank H. Laukien, Ph.D., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bruker Daltonics Inc.
						










Date Published:
9 May 2002
						 





























Frank H. Laukien, Ph.D., is the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bruker Daltonics Inc. Dr. Laukien is also a Managing Director of Bruker Daltonik GmbH, a wholly- owned subsidiary of Bruker Daltonics. He also serves as Chairman of Bruker AXS Inc., and as President of Bruker BioSpin Corporation, both affiliates of Bruker Daltonics. He is a part-time Professor of Mass Spectrometry at the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Laukien holds a B.S. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as a Ph.D. in chemical physics from Harvard University. In November 2001, Dr. Laukien was elected an Officer and Chairman-Elect of ALSSA (Analytical & Life Science Systems Association), the worldwide industry association.
Frost & Sullivan: Bruker Daltonics is one of the most well known providers of isolation identification, and characterization solutions in the life sciences market today. From the vantage this provides, what do you see as the hottest growth markets in the biological sciences? 
Dr. Laukien: Yes, we do have a very strong reputation for high-end products. This reputation is something we have worked hard to build up over decades. Bruker has been and continues to be a strong brand name, one of our most important assets.
With the post-genomic revolution in life-sciences research taking place, we continue to concentrate on providing enabling life-science tools based on mass spectrometry - a fast growing market. Our clients indicate that mass spectrometry has emerged as a crucial bioanalytical technique downstream of genomics. We believe it is important to provide a broad array of life-science mass spectrometry and technologies, building on our mass spectrometry core competency, and not limit ourselves to being a one or two product company. Consequently, we concentrate on a portfolio of products and solutions for a number of "hot growth" markets within the life sciences, especially academia, government, biotech and big pharma.
Within the drug discovery market, genomics, proteomics and combinatorial chemistry are all of importance. Within the drug development market, pharmacogenomics is becoming more and more significant. We are starting to hear a lot about metabolomics. We also feel that shotgun proteomics has an important future, and we are addressing that market with our FTMS product line.
Demand and funding for our cutting-edge products continues to grow worldwide, as life-science research funding is shifting from gene sequencing, DNA/RNA expression arrays, and high-throughput screening towards genetic variation, expression proteomics, functional and structural proteomics, as well as metabolomics. This is a logical progression in the post-genomic era, leading to a new emphasis on high information content, data quality and biological knowledge gain, rather than just throughput. We expect that these funding trends in drug discovery and life-science research will continue to benefit our growth well into the future. 
Frost & Sullivan: The Bruker Daltonics/Biacore International collaboration announced in October of 2001 has now been in effect for almost six months. Has this powerful integration of functional analysis (SPR) and characterization (MS) been validated? When can the research community expect to see this system on the market?
Dr. Laukien: Our R&D collaboration with Biacore, announced last October, has already resulted in the introduction of a technical solution for surface plasmon resonance, or SPR, coupled with mass spectrometry. Our joint SPR/MS solution adds the unique functional information obtained using Biacore’s SPR technology to proteomics databases, allowing users to correlate functional information with the identification and characterization data obtained from mass spectrometry.
The combined semi-automatic SPR/MS technical solution is being co-marketed by Biacore and Bruker Daltonics, and consists of a Biacore 3000 SPR system, a map II/8 MALDI sample prep robot for AnchorChip preparation, and an AutoFlex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. The functional SPR data on protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions, as well as our MS data on protein identification and characterization, are integrated using our ProteinScape data warehousing and analysis bioinformatics software package. We would not want to pre-announce our early customer installations, but these are expected to take place rather soon. We do expect to gain significant competitive advantage from this SPR/MS synergy, as does Biacore. More importantly, this SPR/MS synergy will provide a lot of value to the research community, helping to bring new drugs to market faster, for example.
As you know, Biacore is the SPR leader, with more than 2,000 systems for biomolecular interaction analysis installed. Since Bruker Daltonics has over 2,500 of our own systems installed, we expect to see a high level of SPR/MS activity in our installed base, as does Biacore with its large installed base.

Frost & Sullivan: The growing understanding of biological systems on a genetic level is undoubtedly changing both the methods and efficiencies of drug discovery. It seems studies are increasingly done on computer, using biological simulations or protein interaction models. Bruker Daltonics in fact recently announced significant additions to the bioinformatics software line (ProteinScape, biotools 2.1, and HyStar 2.2). Is the laboratory moving onto the desktop?
Dr. Laukien: We are certainly placing great emphasis on software development. We expect ProteinScape to be our flagship software product for this decade. ProteinScape provides a web-based, client-server platform for storing, organizing and analyzing data generated in the entire workflow of our Proteineer proteomics solution. It operates with industry standard relational database systems like Oracle 9.1 and MS SQL Serverdesktop. Simulations can be useful, but we are going to continue to focus on mass spectrometers and associated solutions which generate, archive and analyze massive amounts of real scientific data, often well into the high terabyte range.

Frost & Sullivan: How does Bruker Daltonics approach product development? Is there a set philosophy as to which product areas will be focused upon, or in how product areas will be chosen?
Dr. Laukien: We focus on developing new platforms, enhancing existing products, and building new applications for the life sciences. We leverage our existing large intellectual property portfolio, in addition to enhancing our IP portolio with new patents.
We have been investing well over 20% of our revenues in product development, helping to keep our product line fresh. Most of our sales come from cutting-edge products we have developed in the last few years. We recognize this rapid cause and effect relationship, so we will continue to grow our R&D investment on an absolute basis. However, our R&D as a percentage of our fast-growing revenues will be dropping off to the mid-teens.
As a result of these development efforts, we just announced six new products at Pittcon, in addition to the three major software enhancements you just mentioned. These are very significant new systems, solutions and bioinformatics tools for expression proteomics, interaction proteomics, and for functional genomics. These novel and rather unique products will be very useful for our pharmaceutical/biotech and academic research customers. 
Frost & Sullivan: The international scope of Bruker Daltonics’ sales effort provides you with a perspective broader than that witnessed by many U.S.-centric business models. Which of these geographic markets do you view as primary growth opportunities for Bruker Daltonics, and which international do you believe will meet this description five years from now?
Dr. Laukien: With our worldwide expansion, we now have offices in 15 countries. We have built up some very competitive global distribution capabilities. Europe is a particularly strong marketplace for us with over half of our revenues coming from there. Japan, where we have three offices, is a strong market and we expect that to remain strong.
Frost & Sullivan: What is your view on Mergers and Acquisitions? How has Bruker Daltonics leveraged their acquisitions & partnerships to their own advantage?
Dr. Laukien: Rather than M&A, we have focused more on strategic partnerships and collaborations with key firms like Agilent Technologies, Sequenom, Biacore, GeneProt, Affinium Pharmaceuticals and Roche, for example. These collaborations have been highly successful for us, and we expect to pursue more alliances like these. Regarding M&A, we could be interested in making some acquisitions provided that the firms have products proven in the marketplace and fit well with both our existing and planned integrated products and solutions. Firms that provide value to scientists at the front end such as liquid handling equipment, or at the back end, such as bioinformatics, could well be of interest.
Frost & Sullivan: Any thoughts on your winning the Frost & Sullivan’s Product Line Strategy Award for the Biotech Instrumentation Market?
Dr. Laukien:We were particularly pleased to receive this award. We have a lot of top people here at Bruker Daltonics working on product strategy and implementation, many of them Ph.D.s in the life sciences. They’re the ones who’ve earned this award for Bruker Daltonics.
Frost & Sullivan: What does the future hold for Bruker Daltonics?
Dr. Laukien:We expect to enhance our number one or number two market position in the key mass spectrometry platforms for life sciences, further expanding our share in this fast growing market, and providing more and more value to research scientists worldwide on an accelerating basis.

Bruker Corporation is a manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research, as well as for industrial and applied analysis. It is headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts and is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Scientific Instruments (Bruker AXS, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics and Bruker Optics) and Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) divisions.
In April 2010, Bruker created a Chemical Analysis Division (headquartered in Fremont, CA) under the Bruker Daltonics subsidiary. This division contains three former Varian product lines: ICPMS systems, laboratory gas chromatography (GC), and GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in 2001).
In 2012 it sponsored the Fritz Feigl Prize,[3] and since 1999 the company has also sponsored the Günther Laukien Prize.[4]

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Bruker Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Joshua Young. Please go ahead.
[06B44C-E Joshua Young]
Thank you very much, Amy. Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to Bruker's fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. My name is Joshua Young. I am the Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development for Bruker. And joining me on today's call are Frank Laukien, our President and CEO; and Tony Mattacchione, Bruker's Senior Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to the earnings release we issued earlier today, we will be referencing a slide presentation as part of today's conference call. The PDF of this presentation can be downloaded by clicking on the earnings release hyperlink on Bruker's Investor Relations website.
During today's call, we will be highlighting non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial statements is included in our earnings release and in our webcast presentation.
Before we begin, I'd like to reference Bruker's Safe Harbor statement, which I show on slide two. During the course of this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's earnings release and in our Form 10-K, as well as other subsequent SEC filings.
Also note that the following information is related to current business conditions and our outlook as of today, February 10, 2016. Consistent with our prior practice, we do not intend to update our projections based on new information, future events or other reasons prior to the release of our first quarter 2016 financial results in May.
We will begin today's call with Frank providing a business summary. Tony will then cover our financials for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 in more detail.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bruker's CEO, Frank Laukien.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joshua. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I am pleased to report that Bruker reported strong financial performance in the fourth quarter and significant improvement in our full year 2015 results. The higher profitability and free cash flow generation are clear evidence that the hard work over the past three years to transform Bruker into a stronger and more profitable company is delivering results.

Our full year 2015 results reflect increasing organic revenue growth; and we surpassed our guidance for operating margin expansion and EPS. I know that these performance improvements came while we were dealing with continued softness in some of our industrial markets and a strong currency headwind to non-GAAP EPS.
I will now begin my presentation on slide four, where I will discuss our Q4 2015 results briefly before focusing on our full year 2015 results, which are more indicative of the underlying trends in our business.
We reported revenues of $478 million in Q4 2015, with year-over-year organic revenue growth of plus 2.5%. This growth was driven primarily by our CALID Group, and our BEST segment. Geographically, Europe and the Americas were the primary drivers of organic growth in the fourth quarter.
Our Q4 2015 non-GAAP operating margin increased by 500 basis points year-over-year versus Q4 2014. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 in Q4 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of plus 27%, despite still facing a year-over-year currency headwind, but aided in part by a favorable tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2015. Finally, our free cash flow of $138 million was very healthy following a strong Q3 2015 and accentuated by strong customer collection.
On slide five, I show Bruker's performance for the full year 2015. In 2015, we reported a revenue decline of minus 10%. This decline was primarily driven by currency effects and also by a minus 2% net decline from our portfolio, as a result of our 2014 CAM divestitures, offset by a partial quarter from our recent Jordan Valley Semiconductor acquisition.
We reported year-over-year organic revenue growth of plus 2% in 2015, which was better than our guidance for plus 1% organic revenue growth and represented a gradual acceleration of growth after an organic revenue decline in 2014.
Geographically, Europe had a strong year delivering organic revenue growth in the high-single digits for 2015. The Americas grew in the low-single digits organically, while Asia Pacific declined in the high-single digits primarily due to weakness in Japan and Southeast Asia.
Our non-GAAP operating margin for 2015 expanded by about 310 basis points to 13.3%, compared to 10.2% in 2014. This improvement was well above our guidance for plus 150 basis points or more operating margin expansion in 2015 due to our stronger profitability in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our non-GAAP EPS for 2015 were $0.89, a 19% increase compared to 2014. In 2015, currency headwinds lowered EPS by minus $0.09, but this was somewhat offset by a discrete tax benefit in 2015 that lowered our full year non-GAAP tax rate.
Finally, our free cash flow hit a record level of $195 million in 2015, more than doubling year-over-year, primarily as a result of our strong performance in the second half of the year. Our 2015 free cash flow performance also benefited from higher customer advances and reductions in our working capital. While our focus on working capital reduction will continue to be a priority, we likely will not reach the same level of free cash flow in 2016.
The recovery of our NMR business in the second half of 2015, combined with strong operating leverage on a reduced cost base, helped us to deliver much better than expected operating profit, EPS and cash flow in 2015. I am also every pleased that our return on invested capital, or ROIC, in 2015 reached a level of greater than 20%.
In summary, we are very pleased that our results in 2015 were much improved compared to prior years and we have clearly turned the corner with our transformation. We now expect several years of gradually increasing organic revenue growth and further margin expansion ahead of us.
Please turn to slides six and seven now, where I'll provide additional details about the year-over-year performance of our three groups and of our BEST segment for the full year 2015.

Let me begin with our BioSpin Group, which reported revenues of $547 million in 2015, representing a minus 3% organic revenue decline. This decline was the result of weakness in our preclinical imaging division combined with a slow start to the year for our magnetic resonance spectroscopy, or MRS division. Our MRS division reported flat revenues for the full year, but generated good organic revenue growth in the second half of 2015. This second half strength was offset by our preclinical imaging business, which posted declines in both revenues and new order bookings in 2015.
Our NMR business experienced a low-teens increase in new order bookings in 2015, representing a nice recovery after a significant bookings decline in NMR in 2014. The effects of volume growth and price increases, both contributed to the growth in new order bookings.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, we already saw some positive effects of higher price backlog flow through to our BioSpin Group margin. At this time, Bruker BioSpin has substantially completed the transfer of ultra-high field NMR magnet manufacturing from our Rheinstetten plant in Germany, which is being closed to our remaining two magnet factories in France and Switzerland.
Next, I will turn to our CALID Group, which reported total revenues of $493 million and 7% organic revenue growth in 2015 along with a major improvement in profitability, in part due to our 2014 CAM divestitures and restructuring. Our Detection Division had an exceptionally strong year 2015, with a number of large transactions, including the explosives trace detection installations at various European airports in 2015.
Our Daltonics Division had a good year of revenue growth in 2015 for nearly all product lines. Our MALDI Biotyper continues to be one of our fastest growing product lines, reaching close to $100 million in revenue in 2015 with approximately 10% year-over-year currency adjusted revenue growth.
After a strong year in 2014, our Optics Division faced weakness in some of its markets, which pressured its top line in 2015. That said, the Optics Division controlled expenses and sustained its above corporate average level of profitability.
Please turn to slide seven now. The NANO Group reported revenues of $460 million, which represented organic revenue growth of approximately 1%. NANO had a mixed year of top line performance as strength in its academic customer segment was offset by continued weakness from industrial and semiconductor and data storage customers.
Our AXS Division had a solid year delivering high-single digit organic revenue growth in 2015, with particular strength in our X-ray diffraction product. We reported a decline in both revenue and profitability for our NANO Surfaces Division in 2015. The division has seen weaker demand from its industrial customers, particularly in regions of Asia outside of China and Japan. And despite the weak market, the division is doing a good job of managing costs and expenses.
Finally, within our NANO Group, our smaller NANO Analytics Division posted low-teens organic revenue growth in 2015, driven primarily by the Micro X-ray fluorescence business.
Our BEST segment reported revenues of $134 million and plus 4% organic revenue growth year-over-year in 2015. BEST also increased its non-GAAP operating margin by 360 basis points to 9.0%. In Q4 of 2015, BEST substantially completed two multi-year programs, ROSATOM and DESY. BEST also achieved strong bookings and backlog increases in 2015 with large long-term superconducting wire orders.
I'd like to wrap up my presentation on slide eight, where I show Bruker's key priorities for 2016. The year 2016 will mark Bruker's transition from a three-year period of transformation, including divestitures and restructuring to our next, more evolutionary phase of operational excellence and lean initiatives. Over the past three years, Bruker has spent more than $90 million on restructuring charges as we changed our portfolio, lowered our fixed cost and began to streamline our supply chain.

We are certainly not done with driving higher levels of operating profitability and cash flow, but future improvements will come more from business and product innovation, being close to our customers, as well as our lean enterprise initiative, outsourcing, implementing better business systems and driving better commercial practices.
Our second priority will be to continue to strengthen our systems and management insights by harmonizing business processes and ERP platforms. In 2015, we went live with a new financial consolidation system. And in early January of 2016, we successfully merged our various instances of SAP, an important step as we consolidate our ERP onto one global platform.
Throughout 2016 and 2017, an important goal will be harmonize our business processes, embed them in our ERP and begin to roll them out in our country sales offices and production sites.
Third, it is important that we continue to invest for future profitable growth. In order to sustain attractive operating leverage, we expect to gradually accelerate our organic growth. We're continuing to make investments in our four strategic growth markets; and we continue to invest a high percentage of our revenues into R&D.
My fourth priority is to reemphasize the focus on customers and the importance of driving product and business innovation. This is the lifeblood of our business and staying close to our customers and ensuring that we're not inwardly focused is a key priority.
I will conclude my comments by stating that I am very pleased with our financial performance improvements in Q4 and for the full year 2015.
With that, let me turn the call over to Tony Mattacchione.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Thank you, Frank. I will now provide some additional details on our financial performance in Q4 2015 and in the full year 2015 starting on slide 10. Bruker had an excellent fourth quarter financially, which built on the positive momentum from Q3 2015. To reiterate Frank's comments, in Q4 2015 we expanded our operating margins by 500 basis points on organic revenue growth of 2.5%. We delivered an EPS increase of $0.08 year-over-year. And we generated $138 million of free cash flow.
On a full year 2015 basis, revenue grew 2% organically year-over-year; and we delivered 310 basis points of operating margin expansion; $0.14 of non-GAAP EPS growth; and $195 million of free cash flow generation. We are very pleased with our financial success in both the fourth quarter and in 2015.
Now let me drill into more detail on our Q4 performance. Our non-GAAP operating income grew 31% to $83.7 million and we reported a non-GAAP operating margin of 17.5%. This operating income growth along with a favorable tax rate drove a 27% non-GAAP EPS increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
Free cash flow generation of $138.2 million in Q4 reflected a $76 million year-over-year improvement primarily driven by our higher profitability, but also from working capital improvements. We typically generate most of our free cash flow in the fourth quarter; and that trend also continued this year in 2015.
Our balance sheet continues to be healthy as our net cash position increased by 41% to $201.6 million, even as we initiated two share buyback programs in 2015. Our working capital reductions in the quarter resulted in an improved working capital to revenue ratio, which was lowered to $0.36 per revenue dollar in Q4 2015, compared with $0.38 in Q4 2014.
Turning to slide 11, I show you the year-over-year revenue bridge for Q4 2015. Despite a 60 basis point net negative portfolio effect and a 7.8% negative effect from changes in foreign currency translation, organic revenue grew 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar resulted in a $39 million currency headwind, while the negative portfolio effect was the result of our CAM divestitures in 2014 and a partial quarter of revenue from our Jordan Valley acquisition in the middle of Q4 2015.

On slide 12, I show our Q4 2015 profit and loss statement. Our Q4 2015 non-GAAP gross margin of 46.6% increased 270 basis points year-over-year. The benefits of our CAM restructuring added 50 basis points to our gross margin in Q4 this year. Roughly 180 basis points of the gross margin improvement was primarily the result of the higher business volume, improved order execution, pricing and operational improvements related to our transformation initiative.
Our Q4 2015 operating expenses were down approximately $20 million year-over-year. In Q4 2015, lower R&D and SG&A spending resulted in a 230 basis point year-over-year contribution to our operating profit margin. The net result is that our non-GAAP operating margin improved 500 basis points compared to a relatively weak Q4 2014 quarter.
Our Q4 2015 non-GAAP tax rate of 19.1% was 90 basis points lower than in Q4 of 2014. This was primarily the result of reversing certain U.S. evaluation allowances. This is primarily also attributable to the higher profits earned in the U.S., which were caused by divestiture of our unprofitable CAM businesses and other tax planning effects this year. Finally, non-GAAP EPS of $0.38 represented an $0.08 or 27% increase from Q4 2014.
On slide 13, you'll see the revenue bridge for the full year of 2015. We reported an organic year-over-year revenue increase of 2.1% in 2015. Changes in foreign currency translation lowered our revenues by 10.2% or $184 million in 2015.
On slide 14, I show our non-GAAP P&L for the full year of 2015. Our non-GAAP gross margins improved by 150 basis points compared to last year. Approximately half of the gross margin improvement was related to the higher business volume, improvements in commercial practices and the operational initiatives associated with our transformation. The savings from our CAM restructuring contributed 60 basis points to the gross margin improvement in 2015.
Our fiscal 2015 operating expenses declined by $88 million compared to last year. Approximately, $62 million of the decrease, excuse me, was related to FX, while the CAM restructuring represented $22 million of the year-over-year decrease in the fiscal 2015 operating expenses.
Our non-GAAP operating margin increased by about 310 basis points year-over-year in 2015, with CAM representing a little over 100 basis points of that increase; and roughly 200 basis points coming from FX and operating leverage we've incorporated into our business model.
Our non-GAAP tax rate of 22% was 310 basis points lower than last year and below the 24% to 25% we had assumed in our guidance. The primary driver of this lower rate was the reversal of the U.S. valuation allowances I referred to previously.
On the bottom line, in 2015, we reported $0.89 of earnings per share – non-GAAP earnings per share, which was $0.14 or 19% higher than 2014 and well above our most recent guidance of $0.75 to $0.80.
Changes in foreign translation rates – foreign currency translation rates reduced our EPS by $0.09, whereas the absence of the divested CAM businesses increased EPS also by $0.09.
On slide 15, I show our 2015 full year cash flow statement. We generated very strong free cash flow of $195 million in 2015, compared with $80.5 million last year. That was a $114.5 million improvement year-over-year. That increase was the result of the higher earnings and lower working capital cost, predominantly by cash collection timing for large NMR installations and significantly higher customer advances we experienced in 2015.
Customer advances, which represent customer down payments, can be large and can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of order receipt and the customer's acceptance of our systems.
Our Q4 2015 cash conversion cycle shortened by 10 days compared to Q4 2014. This was comprised of the following: our days of inventory decreased by seven days to 188 days; our days sales outstanding decreased by two days to 59 days; and our days payable outstanding increased two days to 33 days; all compared to Q4 2014.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we repurchased 2.8 million shares in accordance with our share buyback program. In 2015, altogether, we repurchased approximately 4 million of our shares. Most repurchases occurred in November and December last year. So the effect on our 2015 weighted average share count is not yet very significant. As of the end of 2015, we had 167 million of remaining authorization to buy back shares, as part of the 225 million share buyback program we announced last November.
Now turning to slide 17, I show Bruker's guidance for the full year of 2016. We expect to generate organic revenue growth of approximately 3%; and we expect to increase our non-GAAP operating profit margin by approximately 100 basis points. We expect that our non-GAAP EPS will be in a range of $0.97 to $1.02. We also expect that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will lower our reported revenues by 1.6%, which will only have a nominal effect on our non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2016.
The revenue headwind from FX will be approximately offset by the benefits of our recent Jordan Valley Semiconductor acquisition. This means that organic and reported revenue growth will be around 3% also in fiscal 2016. Our currency assumptions included a yen to U.S. dollar rate of $1.20; a U.S. dollar to euro rate of €1.09; and a Swiss franc to U.S. dollar of CHF 0.99, which were the spot rates at December 31, 2015.
We assume a non-GAAP tax rate range of 25% to 28% for the full year of 2015; and we are assuming a fully diluted share count of approximately 163 million to 165 million shares. We expect CapEx to total approximately $50 million for the full year of 2016.
I would remind investors that much like 2015 we expect the majority of our profitability and cash flow to be generated in the second half of 2016. We also expect to have a seasonally weak first quarter and do not anticipate much year-over-year growth in operating profitability or EPS in Q1 2016.
I will close by stating that we're very proud to report strong improvements in Q4 and for the full year of 2015. We are doing a very more effective job of delivering on our commitments to shareholders; and we expect 2016 to be another good year for operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Joshua to start the Q&A session.

Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Couillard at Jefferies. And I may have mispronounced the name, I am sorry.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon. Frank and Tony, could you give us a sense of what you've embedded in terms of the organic growth guidance for the year by division? Any color you can give us sort of between BioSpin and the other units?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
We don't usually give that granularity. Obviously at the end of the year to help everybody with their models we give sort of the full year revenue for each of the three groups. But I don't think we're going into the granularity of providing growth rates for each of the group or divisions.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we will see strength in our NMR products. The second half of the year was strong from a revenue and an order perspective, but that will be offset of course by continued prolonged weakness in our industrial markets and some of the semi and data storage businesses as well. So that color gives some thoughts on the revenue guidance.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Super. And then one more. Tony, in terms of the 100 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2016, could you help us bridge that sort of between OpEx and gross margin in terms of contributors? And just to make sure I understand your comments correctly, did you indicate that free cash flow would actually be down year-over-year versus 2015?

Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. So most of the operating profit expansion will come from gross profit margin. With a 3% around market revenue growth rate, we believe that leveraging our production costs and benefiting from the initiatives that we've put in place in the last few years as well as some pricing effects will generate most of the operating profit margin expansion in gross profit margin.
With regard to the free cash flow, the implication was, yes, that we don't expect 2016 to be the same in terms of free cash flow generation level; and that's really because of we had a very large amount of customer deposits this year that are very typical with the nature of our long lead time products, particularly in the NMR; and we can't count on that repeating year-over-year. So, yes, that would be the way to look at the cash flow.

The next question is from Steve Willoughby at Cleveland Research.
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Hi, good evening. And kind of a two-part question for you. I guess, first, and I apologize if you did say it, but in 2015 what was the impact from FX on your gross and operating margins? And then I have a follow-up.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
So EPS will be impacted about $0.09 for the full year year-over-year.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
On FX, I think we've stated that it's minus 8% from FX and minus 2% from portfolio, if I recall.
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Okay. I was just trying to see if the 310 basis points you guys expanded operating margins, what the impact from FX was within that number. Because I am just trying to figure out here, when I move into 2016 I see the positive momentum in your NMR business; you're just now starting to benefit from the BioSpin restructurings. I presume that FX is less of a headwind in 20 – like you said, less of a headwind in 2016 than 2015. And so, I am trying to see why operating margins expansion won't be more than the 100 basis points you're guiding to?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Well, it's off a much higher level. Obviously, we came in at 300 bps improvement or 306 bps improvement in 2015. So we benefited from some of the BioSpin restructuring already in Q4 and also some of the pricing. Actually, we did expect to – did start to flow through in Q4 of 2015. So I think if you look at it over two years, I think it makes a lot of sense probably. But we really were able to accelerate some of these things already into 2015 and Q4 2015. And I think that – I think if you take a two-year view, I think it actually will probably match your model pretty closely.
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Okay. Thanks very much.

The next question is from Dane Leone at BTIG.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Hi. Thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on a very strong finish in 2015.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Yeah. I know that's great. You gave a little bit of color on how we should think about the pacing of the year as it relates to the first quarter. Generally speaking, it's always helpful, especially given the large order nature of your business. Should we be kind of thinking about that mid-teens, if we think about the EPS pacing as a percentage of the total year for 2016 kind of that mid-teens for the first quarter and then kind of 20%, 20% and roughly 40% for the fourth quarter again? Or are we thinking a little bit weaker on the first quarter versus the pacing at 2015?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

So, Dan, the trend will be very similar to what we saw in 2015; meaning that if you look at the operating income generated in the back half of the year, it'll be almost identical – at least that's what our plan is – from what we saw this year in 2015.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Okay. All right. So it's pretty much the same pacing is what we've seen in...
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Is there anything that we should kind of call out? There was just a question on kind of the segments, but is there anything that you see in the pipe right now that you call out as kind of a big quarter you expect in kind of any specific quarter next year that we should contemplate in our modeling?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. There really isn't anything. This is Frank. There really isn't anything major; and none of the 1.2 gigahertz systems will go into 2016. That may be late 2017 or 2018. There is no ROSATOM pilot line and things that you may be kept track of in the past. That's done. Some of the big contracts at BEST are done. So really nothing discreet that will likely really stick out. And I would add a little bit to the previous comments that our Q4 2015, good results, people really were working very, very hard to make that happen.
And so they probably pulled in a little bit from Q1 2016. So Q1 2016 probably will be a relatively weak start to the year and not much of an improvement. But we're very comfortable with the full year guidance, which of course implies an acceleration in Q2 and in the second half of the year. I think that's sort of maybe a useful prospective.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
And I would just add quickly that in the second half, some of the growth comes – a lot of the growth comes from new products. So that's a big part of the growth story in the second half of the year.

The next question is from Derik De Bruin at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Derik, are you offline?
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Can you hear me?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay, carry on.
Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, great. Thank you. So a couple of questions. So on the NMR business, nice pickup in orders there. Can you give us some sense on just the mix of those orders? Whether these are like Bruker replacements or people upgrading system, people that are new to NMR, and one that you think that are like Agilent upgrades? I'm just sort of curious on the mix?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Derik, this is Frank. Yeah. I mean all of these things do play a role. Don't really have any quantitative insight for you. But I mean of course we picked up some business from Agilent. Some of it may have gone to our competitor. We've had the price increases that we needed to deliver adequate margins in this business that we implemented a year ago and then we thought would come out in 2016, 2017. About two-thirds of our backlog in NMR probably will be delivered in 2016 and another third goes all the way into 2017.
Turns out we picked up a little bit of that pricing benefit already in Q4 of 2015. Of course, there are some new customers, people that go into clinical metabolomics research eventually into laboratory developed tests by IVD-by-NMR and people that use the food screeners, honey screeners, wine screeners, those are entirely new customers,. And quite honestly, it's nice that they can use an NMR even though they're not at all NMR experts. So some of these new applied market areas are also contributing to the growth of NMR. So the answer is sort of all of the above that you mentioned have contributed to the order growth in 2015.

Dane Leone - BTIG LLC
Great. That's helpful. And the multi-biocipher had a nice 10% growth in 2016. How should we think about that in 2017? I believe you have some new modules coming online and should we think about that as still sort of maintaining a sort of double-digit growth rate for next year or for this year?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
So maybe just to comment on 2015 briefly, Derek. The 10% was including consumables and service, so the systems business is therefore not growing at 10% quite anymore as you might expect. Now that it's a much larger basis, its growth rate for systems business is now in the high-single digits. But the business overall including service and consumables and database upgrades grew at about 10%. Roughly it's the same for bookings and revenue actually.
Until the high value resistance assays and maybe even susceptibility assays of the more distant future, until they play a significant role in maybe a second S-curve, that will be 2017, 2018. So I think in 2016 we'll be continuing to grow the multi-biocipher for identification, in clinical applications, of course, also in some pharma and food and non-clinical applications.
So given that it's a larger business, you might expect a growth rate that gradually slows down and probably ends up being in the high-single digits for 2016. And any reacceleration of that probably is more of a 2017, 2018 story then.

The next question comes from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo Securities.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Within your 3% revenue growth guidance for 2016, can you talk about what you're embedding in there for price?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We are not disclosing that, Tim. If you look at prices primarily around NMR, we've said that it was one of several drivers for Q4; and no question it's an important driver for us as we get into 2016. And I'll also point out that some of the pricing increases we've taken already in the backlog will hit not just this year, but also 2017. So really spread between this quarter and into probably the first half of 2017 as well.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. Let me just try a follow-on to that then. Across your portfolio, not just BioSpin, but your entire business, what percentage of your portfolio do you feel like you have room to push a little bit on price?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think we're trying to be pretty price disciplined everywhere. And so in NMR, there was a one-time discrete step. I mean there are other areas where we have incremental price increases annually simply as a matter of commercial habit now. And, of course, I think the biggest driver on the pricing side tends to be when you bring out entirely new system or major new capabilities. And, for instance, we had some very significant new capabilities in some of the products that were introduced last year by our Bruker Daltonics Division relatively late in the year, which is why it didn't help with bookings or revenue anymore. We introduced some pretty exciting products for our preclinical imaging division at the WMIC Conference in September of last year.
So as you provide entirely new capabilities like PET/MR or very, very fast MALDI imaging systems, that's when you obviously can do some value pricing rather than increasing prices significantly at least on the existing products. But on existing products and services, we tend to have sort of annual at least inflation adjustments. I think maybe that gives you the various levers that we have.
Dane Leone - BTIG LLC

Our next question comes from Ross Muken at Evercore ISI.

Luke Sergott - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC
Hey, guys. This is Luke in for Ross. I guess just to start off, can you just give us a little more color on the APAC region and what you're seeing there among your various customer classes? And call out any particular areas of strength or weakness and if you're starting to see a turnaround in those weak areas?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
APAC is really many different stories. The Japan, relatively weak. Last year in terms of revenue was quite weak; in terms of bookings it was a little better. And don't really see any particular pickup in Japan this year. Currency isn't doing us any favors. China on the other hand has been relatively healthy with academic and research markets being healthier than industrial markets in China as you would probably expect.
And some of the rest of APAC, Korea, Southeast Asia, Taiwan, they've been clearly pockets of weakness. And I guess some of these countries depend on exports to China and are becoming a little more cautious. So anything you'd like to add, Joshua, on?
Joshua S. Young - Vice President-Investor Relations
No. I think the key message is that in China for bookings for 2015, we saw bookings expand in the mid-to-high single digits. So as we think about China for 2016, if that bookings trend continues, we're incrementally more positive versus what we saw in 2015 for revenue.
Luke Sergott - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC
That's great. Thanks. And I guess to follow up with that, you guys talked about your four strategic areas of growth that you're investing in. I guess if you can give us a little more top level thinking about like why you think that now is the best time to invest for this growth. And what kind of additional investments should we be looking at for in 2016?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, we've been investing in this growth all along in our transformation. Our transformation was never just a cost cutting exercise, but of course cutting out cost and getting to a reduced footprint and changing the portfolio; and all of that did take place. But there was also already a significant reinvestment in some of these new product and market opportunities; and that will simply continue. There is no discontinuous additional investment in 2016. The reinvestment trends over the last three years are simply continuing and everything that you've heard is in the guidance and in our budget and business plan. So it's nothing brand new there in terms of investments, but it's been an reinvestment story all along and that continues.

The next question comes from Steve Beuchaw at Morgan Stanley.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. Just a really simple question on NMR. After a year of very strong order trend, some price, some volume – there are number of drivers behind it, right. Academic is a little bit better, Europe is a little bit better, and you have the opportunity to gain share. How did you see over the course of the year that funnel evolving now? As you come out of the year and come into 2016, how do you think 2016 sets up in terms of the potential to maintain a double-digit order growth pace?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I mean, I don't think the long-term growth rate in NMR is not double-digit, so it will slow down for sure on the booking side, because the 2015 strong bookings of course had to do something with Agilent leaving the business and with us raising prices. But it also came right after a pretty significant double-digit drop in 2014 or call it a correction of whatever it was in 2014, so some of that we made up for that at least in part.

So longer-term growth rates for NMR, as I've said at some conferences maybe a couple of years ago or three years ago, I might have still expected them to be in the low-single digits. But given some of the new applied markets, some of the new ultra-high field trends into intrinsically disordered proteins and so on, I am actually now more optimistic that long-term growth rates for the NMR market are in the mid-single digits, but no, double-digit growth rates in orders are not sustainable.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And then just thinking about the backlog progression, would it be safe to say a pretty significant chunk of what we had in terms of the NMR backlog build in 2015 will drive 2017 revenues?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
We convert about 60% or two-thirds of our backlog in any given year. So about a third of the backlog well – revenue or – will revenue in 2017 and two-thirds in 2016.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And that's clearly an NMR comment. I think that's what also your question drove at. It's obviously different for other product lines.
Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks so much.

The next question is from Doug Schenkel at Cowen & Company.
Chris Lin - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi, this is Chris Lin on for Doug today. Thanks for taking my question. I think in the past the sustainability of margin expansion has been an issue, but it does look like recent results and guidance demonstrates solid sustainability going forward. Could you just talk about some of the things that you give confidence in the sustainability of margin expansion over the next several years?
And then, Frank, I believe you recently talked about your longer term margin expansion target. Could you just help us think about how dependent that target is on revenue growth versus realizing the benefits from all the restructuring initiatives you put in place over the past several years?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. I'll take the first part of that question. So we're very confident with the restructuring initiatives and the transformational initiatives we put in place over the last few years. The focus on price and incremental volume at market growth rates that we can effectively with good operating leverage grow our gross profit margins and our operating profit margins by leveraging our production cost and distribution cost and not letting SG&A grow faster than the growth rate on the revenue line. So we feel even at the market growth rate that we're seeing that we can deliver strong operating profit margin expansion, given the way we've landed on our operating model going forward. And we feel like there is few years of runway in that regard as well.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I agree. So, for 2016, I mean a lot of what will drive 2016 operating margin expansion were the actions we took in 2015. And I think that simply summarizes what all the different points that Tony has made. Of course, to drive that into 2017, 2018 and beyond, we'll have to do more things in 2016. But I think between all the actions that we have been taking and continue to take, I really don't see any reason why we wouldn't have really quite a few years of continued margin expansion ahead of us.

The next question is from Tycho Peterson at JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, thanks. Maybe, Frank, on that last point, you've obviously done a lot of the restructuring at this point. Can you maybe talk as to how much of a focus and how much benefit you think you can get this year from supply chain maybe leaner manufacturing, things that are beyond kind of the initial heavy lifting on the restructuring you've done?

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Tycho, we think obviously from the restructuring at BioSpin, which is really just finished by the end of 2015, that will have a big effect on 2016. And of course there are some minor restructurings that are going on. Now really as an ongoing process and management process, we're probably not going to outline those or talk about these at the headline news level very much anymore, because they're not quite of the magnitude of a CAM restructuring or the sizable Bio restructuring last year. So there is ongoing footprint consolidation and also lean initiatives and more outsourcing going on as part of our operational excellence base.
So we haven't really quantified that externally of how much we're going to drive that. And quite honestly what we're driving in 2016 really will have more of an effect on 2017. I think it will be fewer discreet items to track separately and it will just flow into this obviously ongoing goal of having 50 bps to 100 bps operating margin expansion. Hopefully, it's just about each year. And this year, 2016, we're signing up for the 100 bps from everything that we've implemented already and intend to do.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Just a short addition.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then...
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. Sorry, Tycho. Just a short addition. With the heavy lifting kind of behind us, we're really focused on the continuous process improvement and leaning out the production and the supply chain. That clearly is a focus. But what we'll also focus on is marrying that up with smart tax planning as well. So as we advance on continuous process improvement in our supply chain and production processes, which is a lot of opportunity, we'll add to that smart tax planning, which will give further benefits going out in terms of EPS expansion.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And then if we look at some of the businesses, where you had headwinds, preclinical imaging obviously continues to be a bit of a drag. You talked about some of the new products that were introduced last fall. And maybe can you just talk about how you think about potential recovery in that business? And then similarly in NANO services, where things have been tough, do you see any hope there?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we see hope. So good questions. Preclinical imaging in the BioSpin Group with the products – first of all, we really had it – it had – 2014, it had record bookings and revenue. So it's a little bit even in the preclinical MRI just its own little mini cycle.
So we expect a recovery there, a modest recovery there. And then the new product cycle with NMR and a new cryo-free 3 Tesla, a new optical molecular imaging system and a very exciting new PET system. Those are all going to – none of those contributed to 2015 anymore, but we all expect good contributions from that new product cycle in PCI in 2016. Especially in 2016, beyond the MRI cyclical recovery, we're expecting quite a bit of a drive from the new product cycle.
At BNS, it's a little the academic setting. Actually they do a lot research systems, they sell a lot of systems also into areas that are well-funded by NIH, such as cell biology and neuroscience. So those are all good growth drivers.
We're actually somewhat hopeful that this year finally that this the year where semiconductor tools may become healthier and healthier as the year progresses. We see that a little bit internally, but then by simply looking at the larger pure plays in that space, we're encouraged, whereas this maybe 15% of Bruker that are really traditional non-semiconductor industrial markets and that are somewhat concentrated in the NANO group. But of course they also exist elsewhere. For those, we expect relatively weak markets this year.

So BNS is not only industrial, it's also semiconductor, which we think will pick up; and life sciences which we think will pick up including benefiting from a tailwind from NIH funding and similar funding elsewhere in the world. So it's a much more positive mix picture than perhaps sometimes people assume and they think that BNS is all industrial. It luckily is not. We've changed that portfolio quite deliberately over time.

Next question is from Bryan Brokmeier at Cantor Fitzgerald.
Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Frank, you just mentioned a little bit about new products and you talked earlier about it. Could you quantify the impacts in 2016 that you're expecting from new products and how that compares to 2015?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We don't quantify that for competitive reasons and there's too much granularity there, but we expect a healthy benefit from the introductions of 2015. And of course while we don't discuss what they are, we expect some exciting product introductions again in 2016, which then, however, typically end up being 2017 drivers. And I think the rate of meaningful innovation in products and in getting with new products or new applications into adjacent markets such as explosive trace detection and other examples, I think, continues to be very, very healthy.
Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. And you used $65 million to buy back shares during the quarter and you also acquired Jordan Valley. How should we think about your cash use in 2016 and what cash balance level are you comfortable maintaining?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. In terms of capital allocation from a CapEx perspective, there is no major need right now. We have guidance of about $50 million, and that allows for some maintenance spending, ERP and CRM, additional footprint consolidation if necessary. So no major CapEx there. M&A, we have a great technology portfolio. So we don't need significant M&A for that reason. We're very pleased with the collection of businesses that we have and we've done some portfolio trimming with CAM. So we like the three basis businesses we have.
So the M&A would be focused more around bolt-on – to bolt through those great technology positions we have, but nothing transformational would use capital. And, of course, the share buyback program, we have quite a bit left on the share buyback. And given where the stock is trading at now, we'll like buying it back at the lower levels that it's at. And if more uncertainty causes it to be lower, then that's where we'll deploy capital.

The next question is from Miroslava Minkova at Stifel.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the quarter.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Let me start maybe with the CALID Group. It had very strong growth over the course of 2016, I think it even might have strengthened in the back half of the year, and there were some strong orders in detection there. So I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what are you expecting for CALID heading into 2016 and what would be the drivers for this year?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So clearly detection was a bit exceptional in 2015. So we expect lower volume in detection in 2016. Bruker Optics we think will be somewhat steady. And I think the Daltonics business, we're expecting healthy bookings increases this year, probably nothing extraordinary, but we expect that that business in terms of bookings will grow roughly with the markets. And I think the mass spec markets are generally healthy markets. So I mixed probably revenue and bookings a little bit here, I apologize. But did that address your questions or...

Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. I was just trying to get a sense for – again it continued to grow and relatively it has been sort of above corporate average pace for the past several quarters or so?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. We're planning market base growth.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
And that's clearly what we see for 2016. We are coming off of some softness out of Q4 in orders, are a little soft in Q1. So that's part of the reason for the Q1...
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So to be clear, Miroslava, it grew 500 basis points above the corporate average in 2015. We won't be able to sustain that obviously as we get into next year, but it's possible that Daltonics could do slightly better than the 3% that we have the corporate average for the guidance for 2016.
Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay, got it. And on the intrinsically disordered proteins and the new NMR tools, when might we see some of the demand for the ultra-high field begin to materialize? And what would it take? Is it just all about raising funding or is there something that needs to come together in the marketplace for that?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. It's clearly about raising funding. And a lot of institutions or consortia are trying to raise funding. I'm sure they'll be very busy with that in 2016, 2017. So it's not going to contribute to revenue growth this year, particularly strongly, but I think people are really very motivated to get funding whether it's upgrading existing systems or getting new ultra-high field systems and the gigahertz class to be able to address these very important fundamental biology and disease biology opportunities that have opened up with the recognition how important these IDPs are. But it's mostly going to be a 2017, 2018 story in terms of revenue and margins.

The next question is from Isaac Ro at Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Question on pricing. I know you guys talked about – or was it you didn't want to talk too much about 2016. But I was curious if you could maybe recap for us, just to give us a little bit of a baseline, what pricing contribution was in 2015 and then specifically in 4Q given your earlier comments?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So as we mentioned earlier, we're not going to break that out separately. I think if you look at our portfolio, clearly in I'd say parts of our portfolio we're able to take price, but in other parts, particularly those in the industrial or semiconductor markets, price is a lot more competitive right now due to the fall in volume. So as you think how that flows through to the corporate P&L, most of what will flow through will be those NMR pricing increases in 2016 and in 2017.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thanks, and just a follow-up. I think we've all been encouraged by the execution in the course of 2015 played out and looking to get a little more comfort that that will continue this year. I was hoping you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on specifically the CFO search kind of status there, when we might get some clarity?
And then secondly, internally, some of the operational programs that you have in place that you need to really focus on to hit some of your guidance. So whether that's IT or back office systems, anything that's really outstanding I'd be interested to know kind of what some of your operational milestones are? Thank you.

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So on the CFO search, obviously we have an effective current finance team and an Interim CFO and we haven't missed a beat. And the process of the CFO search is going well. We hope to complete this and hopefully make an announcement before the end of the first quarter.
In terms of – I mentioned earlier – an important additional milestone, namely the merge of the various SAP instances that we had within the company in the first week or first business week of January. The lights weren't flickering and we're still in business and that seems to have gone reasonably well. And it provides the basis for now further process harmonization and business process harmonization across all of Bruker, of course, embedded in the ERP systems and then rolled out to the country offices and then factories over the next two years; although this won't be finished in the next two years, it's really an even longer process.
From an investor or financial perspective, it's not going to matter that much. It's not that there is a big bolus of investment coming through. We're pretty much nicely spreading that out over the years. So there isn't one of these cliff events or major boluses. But, yeah, we've made a lot of progress in systems and we still have a lot of work ahead of us to really get this full field factory visibility and to get harmonized business processes.
It will keep us very busy, but it's sort of an ongoing process that to some extent you don't need to worry about that much. We've got it mapped out for the next couple of years and it's really a three-year, four-year process; and of course it never fully stops, but we're making good progress on that.
You'll see an accelerating lean initiative. We focus more on outsourcing and restructuring and we'll continue to do quite a bit on outsourcing. In several divisions, we have one or two more years of quite a bit of outsourcing ahead of us, others are nearly finished with outsourcing. And those that are nearly finished with outsourcing, like for instance the Bruker BioSpin Group will be much more focused on lean layouts of their remaining operations primarily in manufacturing, but really all the way to G&A and R&D and really with a broader lean enterprise perspective, not only lean manufacturing. Hopefully that addressed most of what you were interested in.

The next question is from Dan Arias at Citigroup.
Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Afternoon, thanks for the questions. Frank, to your last comments, roughly speaking, what percentage of the business is now fully under the umbrella of your ERP system? And maybe how should we think specifically about ERP cost this year relative to 2015?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Yeah. I'll answer that, Dan. It's Tony. There's about 60% of our business is on the two major platforms that we have on SAP, and we just completed the merger of those two platforms. So that's the basis for our ERP template going forward. So we're really working on – now that we have a common platform, we're really working on harmonizing the underlying business processes and then embedding those in a template that that platform will carry and we'll roll that out into our commercial businesses and production entities over the next few years.
Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. And just on BioSpin, I am curious whether you think maybe the pricing increases and the restructuring that you've done in NMR are enough to bring the BioSpin gross margins in line or close to in line with the other businesses? Or is there still enough of a gap there to have maybe a bit of a dilutive impact from that business being a bigger part of the mix?

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We're obviously as we – the BioSpin gross margins are moving in the right direction for sure. Our operating margins are above the corporate average anyway, but I think we can do more on gross margin of the BioSpin Group over multiple years. We're not giving multi-year guidance, but as Tony said earlier, of our 100 bps operating profit margin improvement that we're signing up for in 2016, the majority of that has to come from gross margins. It will be more gross margin improvements than OpEx leverage. And, of course, BioSpin is a significant part of that.
BioSpin has – it has margins, gross margins that are maybe a little bit lower than the average. But on the other hand, its SG&A cost tend to be a little bit lower as well. And, of course, for the smaller systems in BioSpin, they're more comparable with the smaller systems of Bruker Optics or mass spectrometry.
But I don't see BioSpin as a drag. I think I see BioSpin this year and last year very much as one of our drivers, and I actually expect that to continue for several more years. I am not worried about BioSpin as a drag. I was a little bit worried in 2014 when the orders came down and it was a drag, but it's recovered really very nicely; and I think it's going to be one of the healthy drivers in 2016 and beyond.
Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's great. Thank you.

The next question is from Shawn Bevec at Deutsche Bank.
Shawn Bevec - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, guys. I know it's still quite early in the year, but have you guys seen any of the recent intensifying macroeconomic concerns weigh on orders so far this year?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's too early, so I'm not aware of it. But of course everybody is watching what's going on around us and what you read in the papers with some concern. And I think we're going to maintain cost discipline and I think we're trying to get leverage on reasonable growth. We're not betting everything on growth, only growth will give us operating margin leverage. So I don't have any internal data that gives me concern. But as I look at the macro picture all around us like everyone else I'm wondering. But as we update, as we report Q1, then in early May we'll perhaps have a somewhat better read on that. At this point, I don't really have anything that's going to be meaningful.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Hey, Shawn, just to put a little bit more color on that. If you look at the pharma, biopharma and academic and government markets, that's probably about 65% plus of our business. So the most exposed piece would be the industrial part of the business, which is somewhere between 15% to 20%; and that's one of the areas we're watching closely.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And within that, I think the biggest piece within industrial is semiconductor; and I think semiconductor and tools, we're actually more optimistic than you heard us in a while based on what we see in that space and Intel and others committing to more CapEx this year and of course us having a bigger footprint with the – and a very relevant footprint with the Jordan Valley Semiconductor acquisition that gave us some of the key X-ray metrology tools for going to smaller nodes and 3D structures. So...
Shawn Bevec - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think those are the drivers.
Shawn Bevec - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
And quickly on the operating margin, just going back to that real quick. What do you think the operating margins for Bruker can look like much longer term? Do you believe that a 20% plus operating margin more in line with your tools peers is achievable?

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We're not going to comment on that. We just haven't given the long-term guidance. At this point, we again have just given one year guidance. We have obviously said at various conferences and I'll say it again that we think we have a lot of runway ahead of us. We have not given a target of where this will end up; and we may do so later this year if we were to hold an Analyst Day. But for right now, we're comfortable.
And obviously, we're very glad. We made a big step forward. We kind of skipped the year last year by doing two years of progress in one year in operating profit margin, if you like. And I think we're going to – from everything that we've put in place already, and of course we're not done managing the business, I think we'll have a decent year of operating margin improvement. But we have not picked a target number and I won't do so right now. But for now we'll simply go with the annual guidance. And hopefully we can deliver that again as we did last year.

The next question is from Eric Criscuolo at Mizuho.
Eric J. Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Thanks. Good afternoon.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hello.
Eric J. Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Tony, what was the outstanding share count at the end of 4Q?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
It was around 163 million before the dilutive effect of stock option exercises.
Eric J. Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Thanks. And then just getting back to the macroeconomic question. What kind of impact, if any, are you guys seeing from the oil markets? And has that changed in any way since the divestitures?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Thank goodness. I mean, we didn't see that coming. But in fact a lot of the divestitures in ICP-MS and GC and GC single happen to have energy markets, oil markets as a particularly important market. And coincidently – I wish I could take credit – but coincidently we divested of these for other reasons and then it turned out that the markets for those things are really hurting right now.
We have some relatively minor involvement in energy markets. Of course, some of our instruments are sold into energy markets. Some big oil companies and national oil companies or oil research institutes sometimes buy a $2 million FTICR MS, FTMS system for petroleum mix research; and that's not so much effected anyway by the otherwise somewhat abysmal economic situation in the energy market. So in short that has very little effect on us. Of course, some secondary effects perhaps, but overall that has very little effect on us.

The next question is from Sung Ji Nam at Avondale.
Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two quick ones. First of all, Tony, I understand why the tax rate was lower in 2015 versus 2014. But for 2016 guidance why is it higher, what's driving that? And second question is, is preclinical imaging still roughly 20% of BioSpin revenue? Thank you.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
The higher tax rate is simply because we are now a tax payer in the U.S. The reason why the rate is lower is because we reversed some valuation allowances against future tax benefits because we had tax losses in the U.S. We now are tax payers, so more of the mix of our jurisdictional pre-tax income will be in the U.S. and that carries a higher tax rate. And if you don't – could you repeat the second part of your question.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The second part, preclinical imaging is just a little bit under 20% of overall BioSpin revenues for FY 2015.

Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
Okay.

The next question is from Aurko Joshi at William Blair.
Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, we can.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - Interim CFO, Senior Vice President of Finance & Accounting
We can hear you.
Aurko Joshi - William Blair & Co. LLC
Yeah. I just had a quick question regarding some that discussed upside drivers on leverage and organic revenue growth. I know you went kind of group by group, but where do you see an end market which you think may surprise investors in general as discussed?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you're getting at the biggest source of upside as we think about 2016, obviously whenever we have large NMR deals that close that is one source of potential upside; and then the new products as well is also going to be a potential source. So some of the ultra-high fields, when you get above 1 gigahertz is 2017, but some transactions could still be in the multi-million dollars for 2016 as well.

Good afternoon, and welcome to the Bruker Q3 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to Joshua Young. Please go ahead.
Joshua S. Young - Vice President-Investor Relations
Thank you very much, Amy. Good afternoon. I'd like to welcome everyone to Bruker's third quarter 2015 conference call. My name is Joshua Young, and I am the Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development for Bruker. Joining me on today's call are Frank Laukien, our President and CEO; Tony Mattacchione, Bruker's Senior Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Rene Lenggenhager our newly appointed President of the Bruker BioSpin Group.
In addition to the earnings release we issued earlier today, we will also be referencing a slide presentation as part of today's conference call. The PDF of this presentation can be downloaded by clicking on the earnings release hyperlink on Bruker's Investor Relations website.
During today's call, we will be highlighting non-GAAP financial information. A reconciliation of our GAAP to our non-GAAP financial statements is included in our earnings release and in our webcast presentation.
Before we begin, I'd like to reference Bruker's Safe Harbor statement, which I show on slide two. During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events or the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from the projections described in such statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's earnings release and in our Form 10-K, as well as other subsequent SEC filings.
Also note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, November 4, 2015. Consistent with our prior practice, we do not intend to update our projections based on new information, future events or other reasons prior to the release of our fourth quarter 2015 financial results in February 2016.
We will begin today's call with Frank providing a business summary. Rene will then have a few brief comments about the reason he joined Bruker, before Tony will cover the financials of the third quarter and the first nine months of 2015 in more detail.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bruker's CEO, Frank Laukien.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Joshua. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. I am pleased to report that Bruker reported stronger, well balanced operational performance in the third quarter of 2015. Our organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation were all much higher on a year-over-year basis.

I will begin my presentation on slide four. We reported revenues of $396 million in the third quarter of 2015, which represented a decrease of minus $24 million or minus 6% from Q3 of 2014. Foreign exchange rates reduced our revenues by minus 11% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2015. Our year-over-year organic revenue growth in Q3 2015 was plus 8%. This strong growth was driven by our CALID and our BioSpin group. CALID sustained it's a strong first half performance by delivering double-digit organic growth in the third quarter of 2015.
Our BioSpin Group also delivered strong organic growth due to a rebalance in our NMR business. Geographically, Europe and Asia Pacific were the primary drivers of organic growth in the third quarter.
Our third quarter 2015 non-GAAP operating margin increased by plus 470 basis points year-over-year versus Q3 2014. While our CAM restructuring in 2014 helped to drive approximately plus 120 basis points of this improvement. The remaining increase was related to positive mix and some accelerated customer acceptances in Q3 2015, which originally had been expected in Q4 of 2015.
We also continue to make underlying operational improvement in our business. We reported non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 in Q3 of 2015, which represented year-over-year growth of plus 36%, despite facing a higher tax rate and a year-over-year FX headwind of minus $0.02.
Finally, we generated $45 million of free cash flow, a plus $41 million year-over-year increase due to higher profitability and more efficient working capital. I would also note that we faced a weaker comparison in – with Q3 2014.
Moving onto slide five, I show Bruker's performance through the first nine months of 2015. During the first nine months of 2015, we reported a revenue decline of minus 12%. This decline was primarily driven by currency effect in the 2014 CAM divestitures.
We reported year-over-year organic revenue growth of plus 2% in the first nine months of 2015. High single-digit organic revenue growth in our CALID group and low single-digit organic revenue growth in our NANO group more than offset a low single-digit organic revenue decline in our BioSpin group year-to-date. Geographically, Europe and Asia were the strongest performing regions on a year-to-date basis.
Our non-GAAP operating margin for the first nine months of 2015 expanded by 220 basis points to 11.5% compared to 9.3% in the same nine months period of 2014. Our non-GAAP EPS for the first three quarters of 2015 were $0.51 a plus 11% increase compared to the same period of 2014. Excluding the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, our EPS would have grown by plus 26% in the first nine months of 2015 year-over-year. Finally, our free cash flow more than tripled year-over-year during the nine month period of 2015 primarily as a result of our strong performance in Q3 2015.
So in summary, the operating performance trends through the first nine months of the year are very good. Our BioSpin business is starting to rebound after a slow start to the year. And we are generating higher organic growth and we are we're driving higher operating margins and free cash flow.
Please turn to slide six and seven now, where I will I'll provide additional details about the year-over-year performance of our three groups and of our best segments in the third quarter of 2015.
Let me begin with our BioSpin Group, which reported strong organic revenue growth as a result of a rebound in our Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or NMR business. Our NMR revenues grew in all geographies and we also benefited from timing as we were able to complete several installations in Q3 of 2015 that we had expected to finish later in the year. I would also remind you that BioSpin had a weak first half of 2015 and benefited from some catch-up in Q3 2015.

Our new order bookings for NMR continued to remain healthy and we believe that the market is recovering from the weak demand that we experienced last year. Our BioSpin Preclinical Imaging or PCI division posted mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter, which was driven by our preclinical MRI product. Even though the division posted reasonable revenue performance in Q3, our PCI new order bookings are weak on a year-to-date basis. As a result of this weakness, we have decided to restructure the molecular imaging business of PCI to better align our cost structure with the lower revenue outlook.
In addition to healthy revenue growth, BioSpin also posted significant profitability improvement in the third quarter as a result of two primary factors. First, the BioSpin Group benefited from higher volume and a favorable product mix after unfavorable product mix in the second quarter of 2015. Second, we are seeing margin benefits from our restructuring and operational excellence action. Overall, BioSpin had a much improved third quarter, but some of this outperformance was related to timing.
Next, I will turn to our CALID group, which generated healthy double-digit organic revenue growth in the quarter and improved profitability. CALID saw healthy demand in Europe and Asia including China in the quarter. One of the drivers of this performance was our Daltonics Division, which experienced broad-based strength in nearly all product lines and geographies in Q3 of 2015.
We have spent a lot of time working with strengthening the product portfolio of Daltonics and we're seeing improved demand. Our Detection Division, which is part of CALID also continued its strong year with another quarter of exceptional revenue growth as a result of its new explosives trace detection product or ETD, which we delivered in Q3 of 2015 in Europe.
Detection is a lumpy business and after a weak 2014, we are seeing a strong year in 2015. One should note that there will be much less explosives trace detection business in the immediate future as the European airports now mostly have been upgraded to newer technology.
Please turn to slide seven now, where I will discuss the performance of our Bruker NANO Group and our BEST segment. The NANO Group reported an organic decline in revenues and new order bookings in the third quarter primarily as a result of weaker demand from our industrial customers. The bright spot for the NANO Group continues to be our AXS Division, which posted mid single-digit organic revenue growth in Q3 2015 and is benefiting from higher demand for its x-ray diffraction product as well as some timing effects due to improved execution for its order to revenue processes. Revenue in our NANO Surfaces division declined in the quarter with particular weakness in the semiconductor and data storage industry. We currently don't see any signs that demand for the division's products will improve in the short-term, but we continue to be strong believers in the long-term potential of our technologies and products in semiconductor metrology.
This conviction is reflected by our recent – very recent acquisition of Jordan Valley Semiconductor, which was announced earlier this week. The closing of the acquisition was announced earlier this week.
The acquisition is expected to enable us to capitalize on the secular trends, towards smaller and smaller feature sizes and three dimensional structures in the semiconductor metrology market. I will talk more about this transaction on the next slide.
Finally, turning to our BEST segment despite an organic revenue decline of 3% in Q3 2015, BEST expanded its non-GAAP operating margin to almost 10%. The decrease in revenue is the result of a difficult year-over-year comparison due to ITER back in Q4 – Q3 of 2014 and some RI-GmbH revenue shift into Q4 of 2015.

Additionally, the ROSATOM pilot lines effectively shifted out of the third quarter and this pilot line will present approximately $6 million of low gross margin revenue in Q4 of 2015.
We are very pleased that our BEST segment in the first nine months of 2015 have seen more than 20% order growth year-over-year, with large superconducting wire orders from major MRI manufacturers, who have determined that the excellent performance, timeliness and highest quality of our BEST superconductors enable them to achieve lowest overall cost.
On slide eight, I would like go into more detail about the rationale of our Jordan Valley Semiconductor acquisition. You can see on this slide that the ongoing digital revolution in social media, cloud computing, and smaller portable electronics is changing the types of tools required to serve the semiconductor metrology markets.
Semicon customers are demanding faster and more precise metrology of smaller and smaller feature sizes and three dimensional structures at advanced semiconductor node. Jordan Valley provides x-ray metrology and defect-detection equipment for semiconductor process control, that will enable Bruker to be a bigger player in what we believe will be a fundamentally attractive market.
Not many other metrology tools can provide useful results at these emerging advanced nodes. By combining Jordan Valley's core metrology strength with Bruker's complementary x-ray technologies, we believe we are very well positioned to capitalize on the adoption of new technologies and the next cycle of growth in semiconductor metrology.
I would like to wrap up my presentation on slide nine, where I show the key messages that have emerged after our performance in the third quarter. Earlier this year, I conveyed to you that my highest priority in 2015, was to ensure that Bruker delivered on its financial guidance for the full year. I'm pleased to report that after nine months, we are in an excellent position to meet or exceed our original fiscal year 2015 guidance for organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion and EPS. Our strong performance in Q3 2015, has put us in a position, where our year will be somewhat less dependent on Q4, which should help de-risk the full year.
Our BioSpin Group is recovering after a weak start to the year, as a result of better performance from our NMR business. I'm encouraged by both the revenue and new order bookings performance from NMR and I'm optimistic that this trend will continue. Our CALID Group is having a much stronger year and we're seeing good growth for new broad products and for core franchises.
With the elimination of our CAM losses at the end of 2014, CALID has significantly improved its profitability. Finally, we are attracting exceptionally experienced top notch managers to join both our senior management team and our Board of Directors.
During the third quarter, we announced that Dr. Hermann Requardt, the former CEO of Siemens Healthcare and John Ornell, the former CFO of Waters had joined Bruker's Board of Directors. We are excited to add two highest quality executives such as Hermann and John.
We've also been strengthening our management team even further. We recently announced that Rene Lenggenhager will take over as President of Bruker BioSpin and I will introduce Rene to you in a moment.
In addition, we recently hired Christian Busch as BioSpin Group, EVP of Finance. Christian joined us from Novartis to take over the leadership for the BioSpin Group finance function. And we made an important hire in our Daltonics Division, where Dr. Dietrich Hauffe has been named as the Executive Vice President of our Life Science Mass Spectrometry business. Dietrich have joined us from PHN and he also had a very successful career working for Dionex previously.

So, with the improved performance of BioSpin, the continued momentum of CALID and key new managers joining Bruker, I feel good about what we have accomplished in the first nine months of the year.
Now, before Tony dives into the financial details of Q3, I'd first like to turn the call over to Dr. Rene Lenggenhager to introduce himself to all of you. Rene, please.
Rene Lenggenhager - BioSpin Group President, Bruker Corporation
Thank you, Frank. Even though today is only my third day at Bruker, I though it would be helpful to provide you some perspective on why I joined Bruker and what I see as the opportunity in the BioSpin Group.
Bruker has a strong culture built on customer intimacy, innovation with integrity, and product leadership. This culture fits well with my past experience at Mettler Toledo, and attracted me to join the company.
I also joined because I'm excited about the potential of the BioSpin Group. Bruker is a market leader and NMR will be a critical technology to help enable new scientific discoveries as new applied clinical and industrial solutions in the future. We will continue the tradition of innovation, but it will also forward the operational excellence and lean initiatives, an ongoing journey that can continue to bring improvements year-after-year.
I'm very familiar with the advantages and the challenges of managing business franchises, where you have a market leader position. At my previous company, I completed many operational excellence projects ranging from R&D, sales and marketing, operations and logistics.
From commercial perspective, I was responsible for enhancing the value selling capabilities of our sales force while strengthening our processes and delivering sustainable growth and margin expansion. I understand that the customer success and financial success need to go hand-in-hand and I see many opportunities to work with Frank and help make group of BioSpin an even more successful all around high performance franchise. In the near-term, I'm focusing on several key priorities. First, I will be working to gain a deeper understanding of the BioSpin business, customers and markets.
Second, I will work with the organization to finalize business targets and goals for 2016. Third, I will ensure that the group successfully completes its ongoing restructuring initiatives. And finally, I will ensure that we continue to drive operational and commercial excellence to new levels all with a focus on customers, innovation and profitable growth.
So, I will close by stating that I'm excited to be part of the Bruker team. I see tremendous potential in the BioSpin business and I look forward to meeting our shareholders and analysts in the coming year.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Tony Mattacchione.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Thank you, Rene and welcome to the Bruker leadership team. I will now provide some additional details on our financial performance in Q3 2015 and for the first nine months of 2015. Financially, Bruker had a very good third quarter in all respects. Organic revenue increased 8.1%, gross and operating margins expanded by 190 basis points and 470 basis points respectively. And EPS increased $0.05 or 36%.
Finally, we generated $45 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which is at a high watermark for us this year.
On slide 11, I show a snapshot of our Q3 2015 non-GAAP results. Our total revenues were $396 million, a decrease of 6% from the third quarter of 2014. Our non-GAAP operating income was $52.8 million, a 47% increase from Q3 2014 and our non-GAAP operating margin increased 470 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% from 8.6% in Q3 2014.
While we had an easy comparison compared to Q3 2014, our profitability improvement reflect a strong quarter in both our nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectroscopy businesses. We also benefited from improvements we have made to our portfolio, our operating capabilities and our fixed cost structure.

An offset to these improvements was continued weak demand from most of our semi-data storage and industrial customers, and our Bruker NANO Group. The net result of these drivers was that our non-GAAP earnings per share increased 36% to $0.19 a share in the quarter. As I mentioned, we generated $44.7 million of free cash flow in Q3 reflecting a strong year-over-year improvement, which I will elaborate on in a minute. Our higher free cash flow combined with continuous improvements in our working capital ratios led to a strong year-over-year improvement in our net cash position.
On slide 12, I show the revenue bridge for Q3 2015. Despite a 2.8% negative effect from the 2014 CAM divestitures and a 10.9% negative effect from changes in foreign currency translation, organic revenue grew 8.1% in the third quarter of 2015. Organic revenue growth of $33.2 million in Q3 2015 was driven by our CALID and BioSpin groups as Frank had mentioned. I would also note that our CALID group in particular had a very strong quarter of performance.
On slide 13, our Q3 2015 non-GAAP gross margin of 46.1% increased 190 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Foreign currency translation decreased our gross profit by $20 million in the quarter, but had a small positive effect of 20 basis points on our gross margin percentage. The benefits of our CAM restructuring added another 65 basis points to our gross margin in Q3 2015. The roughly 100 basis points of remaining gross margin improvement was primarily the result of higher volume and a more profitable product mix in the quarter.
BioSpin had a very strong quarter of gross margin performance due to a number of factors including the positive effect of the restructuring and operational improvements we've completed over the last couple of years. We also benefited from earlier than expected revenue recognition on some systems with higher gross margins in the quarter. Our Q3 2015 operating expenses were down approximately $20 million year-over-year. Approximately $15 million of this decrease was related to foreign currency translation with the remaining decline primarily related to our CAM restructuring. Careful management of our fixed cost structure has resulted in more pull-through of gross profit increases to our operating process.
Non-GAAP operating margin improved 470 basis points compared to Q3 2014. In addition to the higher gross margin, another factor in driving our higher operating margins was an R&D expense decline of 130 basis points year-over-year. CAM and FX represented most of this increase but we also selectively cut back R&D project spending in our NANO and BioSpin groups.
Our Q3 2015 non-GAAP tax rate was 32.2% which was 5.2% higher than the previous year third quarter and this was caused by a change in our jurisdictional mix including an expected decrease in U.S. profit as a result of the weakness in the NANO group. Our full year 2015 non-GAAP tax rate is now expected to be between 24% and 25%. Finally, non-GAAP EPS of $0.19 represents a $0.05 or 36% increase from Q3 2014 despite facing a $0.02 headwind from foreign exchange.
On slide 14, I show a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results for the third quarter. In Q3 2015, we excluded $24.6 million of operating cost from our non-GAAP results. This was a decrease of $6.4 million from Q3 2014. This decrease is driven by lower restructuring and other costs. I would also note that our non-GAAP interest in other income and expense net line increased by $2.4 million year-over-year, as a result of higher FX foreign currency transaction losses.
On slide 15, I show the revenue bridge for the first nine months of 2015. We reported organic year-over-year revenue increase of 1.9% after the first nine months of 2015. Changes in foreign currency translation lowered our revenues by 11.1% or approximately $145 million with a weaker euro driving most of year-over-year difference.

On slide 16, I show our non-GAAP P&L for the first nine months of 2015. Our non-GAAP gross margins have improved by 120 basis points compared to the first nine months last year. The gross margin improvement through the first nine months is a similar story to what we saw in Q3 2015. From a group perspective, CALID drove most of this improvement as savings from our CAM restructuring added 65 basis points to the gross margin improvement through the first nine months of the year.
Changes from foreign currency rates added another 20 basis points of improvement with the remaining increase related to a more profitable revenue mix. The CAM restructuring and FX represented all of the $67 million year-over-year decrease in operating expenses in the first nine months of 2015. Our non-GAAP operating margin increased by 220 basis points year-over-year, though the first nine months of 2015 with CAM representing a little over 100 basis points of this increase and roughly 100 basis points coming from fundamental improvements in the rest of our businesses.
On the bottom line, we reported $0.51 in non-GAAP EPS, which was $0.05 or 11% higher in the first nine months of 2014, primarily due to the strong operating earnings growth in Q3 2015. Changes in foreign currency translation rates reduced our EPS by $0.07, whereas the absence of the divested CAM businesses increased EPS by $0.07 as well.
On slide 17, we show the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation for the first nine months of 2015. We excluded operating costs of $56.5 million compared to $59.8 million in the first nine months of 2014. Lower restructuring costs were offset by higher other costs in the first nine months of 2015. The biggest drivers of the higher other costs are related to outsourcing of our – the outsourcing of our pension plan in Switzerland and higher IT costs related to our ERP, financial consolidation and human resource transformation system initiative.
On slide 18, I show our cash flow statement for the third quarter of 2015. We generated free cash flow of $44.7 million in Q3, compared with $3.6 million in the same period in 2014, which is a $41 million improvement. Higher GAAP net income together with lower restructuring costs, lower depreciation and amortization and improved working capital efficiency, all contributed to the free cash flow increase. Also contributing to the increase were approximately $12 million of tax refund resulting from settled audits in Germany.
Our cash conversion cycle improved by 19 days compared to the Q3 2014. This would comprise of the following. DIO decreased by 24 days to 206 days. Our DSO decreased by four days to 56 days. And this was an improvement that was partially offset by a reduction in our days payable outstanding which totaled 38 days, compared to 48 days in Q3 2014.
Overall, we are pleased with the improvement in our working capital, but we do have further room for improvement. During the third quarter, we repurchased 395,000 shares as part of our share buyback program. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased approximately 1.25 million shares.
Now, turning to the guidance, I show Bruker's updated guidance for the full year of 2015. As a result of our performance in Q3 2015, we are increasing our guidance for non-GAAP operating margin expansion and for EPS. We continue to expect to generate organic revenue growth of approximately 1% but with our year-to-date profitability improvement, we now expect to increase our non-GAAP operating margin by 150 basis points or more, compared to our previous guidance of 100 basis points or more.
We now expect that our non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 compared to our previous guidance of approximately $0.75. We expect changes in foreign currency exchange rates to reduce our reported revenue by approximately 10% for the full year in 2015, which refines our earlier guidance of 9% to 10% adverse effect. This will generate a headwind to our non-GAAP EPS of roughly $0.10 for the full year in 2015. Our currency assumptions include a yen to U.S. dollar rate of $1.2 and a U.S. dollar to euro rate of 1.12, which were the spot rates at the end of Q3 2015.

We expect fiscal year 2015 CAM related revenues to decrease by $50 million in 2014 – sorry, in 2015 compared to 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect the non-GAAP, our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 24% and 25% for the full year in 2015. So, I will close by reiterating that the third quarter was a very good quarter of overall financial performance, performance improvements for the company. The strong outperformance in Q3 put us in an excellent position to deliver our full year of attractive operating margin, earnings growth and cash flow improvement and commitment.

Certainly. Our first question comes from Steve Willoughby at Cleveland Research.
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Frank, you went from a mid single-digit year-over-year decline in your BioSpin business last quarter to calling it out as an area of strength here in the third quarter. I was just wondering given your relatively positive commentary regarding orders the last few quarters, should we expect the NMR business to kind of turn the corner now and expect a more positive result to continue in the fourth quarter and going into next year?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes, Steve. I do think there is a sustainable improvement in NMR with orders for the full year that you're expected to clearly be stronger than last year, which are pretty weak orders, as you recall. In the first half of this year, we had some execution issues in that Bruker BioSpin business that I think we've fixed to a great extent and clearly, at least we made very significant improvement in Q3. And so, I think with healthy orders in NMR this year compared to last year and improved execution, I think we're on a good path to hopefully be able to call that in another one or two quarters for sustainable improvement. I'm optimistic here.
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Just one follow-up on that, Frank. In regards to the strength of the orders you're seeing in NMR, I know you've been calling it out as healthy for the past several quarters. Was the strength in orders in NMR any different here in the third quarter as compared to what you saw in the first or second quarter?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
The NMR orders fluctuate even more from quarter-to-quarter, that's even lumpier. So looking at orders in any given quarter, Q3 orders were excellent, but there also was an also ultra-high field order. As you may recall, we had a press release in some of our ultra-high field orders. Some of which of course won't get delivered and turn into revenue for several more years. But overall, it's been – it's been – for the year it's healthy single digits that's healthy for the full year. And in any given quarter, it really goes up and down a little bit, I really wouldn't want to comment quarterly on BioSpin orders because they fluctuate too much. For the year, they're healthy as we said before and that implies single digits. But...
Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC
Thanks, very much. Okay. Thanks, Frank.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.

The next question is from Brandon Couillard at Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Yes. Good afternoon. Frank, in terms of the – I guess the more balanced second half revenue cadence here, I mean was that largely a function of luck or better management of the cadence? And how much control do you – can you really exert on this dynamic to perhaps level it out more so in the future?

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We work very, very hard on it, Brandon and then we got lucky. Sometimes, you work very hard and you don't get lucky and things fall out, but we worked very hard. We've made a very concerted effort to do better than our own previous internal forecasts for Q3 and we succeeded. So that was good, because I was not comfortable with the way Q3 and Q4 were shaping up with Q4 is always the strongest quarter of the year, that will never be changed. But it was too much with – would have come in from Q4 and I wanted to achieve more in Q3 already. But keep in mind that Q3 was a mix, there was some favorable mix. There was some favorable timing for which we worked very hard, but they also were from improving fundamentals. It's really a mix of those three things coming together.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC
Thanks. And a quick one for Tony. Could you give us the impact of currency in terms of operating profit dollars in the third quarter?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Sure. Actually, let me get that back – get that to you later.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC

The next question is from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Thank you. Frank, on pre-clinical imaging business, you said it was weak and you decided to take a restructuring. So I'm assuming that you are anticipating that weakness will continue. Can you talk about what's going on in that business a little bit more broadly?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you – which you do I know of course, Tim, If you followed our press releases, you'll notice that in the third quarter, we had some of the most significant product introductions in that. We have a new preclinical PET SPECT system, we call it the Albira Si, which we think is going to be performance leading. We came out with a cryogen-free 3 Tesla magnet and an MRI PET combination and also optical molecular imaging, a new system. So major, major product introductions in PCI in Q3, but of course, you don't get orders and revenue from that yet. That's going to take probably a couple of quarters before that begins to ramp up. So we're not only doing restructuring. Although we did some restructuring or we are in the process of doing some restructuring in some of the optical molecular imaging product line, which we're streamlining and integrating into another R&D site and factory.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And just one ...
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I don't know if I answered all of your questions, but that's sort of the big picture.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
That is helpful. And I just wanted to squeeze one in on your margin guidance, you said greater than 150 basis points of expansion. If I just kind of triangulate on revenue and EPS, I could get to a margin number that is meaningfully more than 150 basis points of expansion. I want to make sure that I'm calculating that correctly and there is nothing below the line that would kind of maybe make the margin a little bit lower and still allow you to come in to EPS guidance?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
There is just still a lot of risk every fourth quarter, (41:57) by a significant margin, well I try not to use the word margin here. But the fourth quarter will be the biggest quarter of the year in every respect and so therefore there is risk if some sites are not ready or the magnets don't make it to field and things like that. I think we're, the 150 bps guidance or greater than 150 is reasonable, there is upside to that, but there is also risk.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

Okay. Thank you.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Tim, there is nothing below the line noteworthy and as both have Frank and I'd mentioned in our comments we had very positive mix in Q3. We don't expect that mix to continue in Q4 and we do have from lower margin business that we expect to revenue in Q4 as well. So, we don't expect that mix to continue. And if I may just to go back to Brandon's question the FX impact on operating profit was about $5 million in the third quarter.
Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
$5 million negative?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Negative.

The next question is from Derik de Bruin at Bank at America Merrill Lynch.
Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi, good evening, it's actually Mike Ryskin calling in for Derik. Thanks for taking my question. Kind of a follow-up on something that's been asked before about the third quarter, fourth quarter split. Most of you – as you mentioned, most of your second half strength usually comes from 4Q, you alluded to that in some guidance earlier this year. But then today, you also mentioned that you saw some strong sales in CALID with explosive trace detection, which was lumpy non-recurring. Then you had some orders in BioSpin move up from 4Q, and those two groups really drove your performance. Could you provide some color on how much of an effect you think those two factors will have in 4Q? And whether or not we should expect sort of similar ramp that we've seen in prior years, especially given the difficult comp you have with 2014?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Yeah. Mike, like we just mentioned Q3 we had – the timing of Q3 there was more acceptances that we expected, those won't continue into Q4. And we – yeah, so we benefited from the timing. The year-over-year Q4 is not expected to be much higher or much lower as well. So, that will play an effect on the sequential comparison.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, so being a little less dependent on Q4 is a healthy thing. I'd like to make that – I'd like to reach that, achieve that in every year. Q4 will still be a very strong quarter. And I think you kind of always – we're giving guidance for the full year. We're reporting the first nine months, so you can really triangulate what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. But as always, keep in mind that for Bruker even though we have better and better tools to predict, there is still a plus/minus $15 million type of uncertainty and that's very fundamental because we deal with bigger systems and customer acceptances and insights that can or that may or may not be ready. So, I think, this is you know, reasonable guidance, and I think, that's makes still for a very strong Q4, but I am glad that we moved a little bit more into Q3, otherwise Q4 would have been, we would have relied too much on Q4, I think, that's really all there is to it. It's not that all of a sudden Q3 is stronger than Q4, but I think, it's just a healthier sequence of events as we now envision it.

Our next question is from Doug Schenkel at Cowen & Company.
Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my question. I only have one, but it does have four parts. So, just related to NMR order improvements and the healthy order bookings, one, was the momentum pretty balanced across higher field products, and lower field products where your major competitor exited? Two, anything notable in terms of geographic strengths or weaknesses? Three, is it too early to determine with about the improvements in academic government budgets freeing up is helping order trends? And four, anything available data-wise, that would demonstrate that some of your newer product launches are starting to have an impact on driving a replacement cycle? Thank you.

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We love your one single question, Doug. So, an NMR order, geographically we're pretty balanced, so there was strength everywhere, in the quarter year-to-date Europe was quite strong. NMR orders ultra-high field has been, it was dormant – almost dormant last year, it has recovered a little bit, but it's not at its usual strength, and new orders for gigahertz systems and gigahertz class systems as these are, depending on field strength $10 million to $20 million types of funding that takes longer, so we don't have anything under our belt yet in that direction from new orders. There's one 1.2 gigahertz order that we added in Frankfurt in the third quarter, sorry I don't want to skip that, but that's just been in the works and in the pipeline for a very long time and finally got funded. So ultra-high field I would say partial recovery compared to 2014 but not as strong as we had seen some time ago and quite honestly not as strong as we might expect hopefully in 2016, 2017 as the gigahertz class NMR systems hopefully we'll generate along with the new applications particularly for intrinsically disordered proteins, which I think will be very important but that has not materialized into orders yet.
Academic trends, more or less as they have been, Japan is still weak, India, Middle East, Africa a little bit weak in BioSpin and Europe and the U.S. relatively healthy and China not bad. New products, yes some of the more new products that don't require very large budgets like the Fusion, the Fusion Solution combining NMR and high revolution accurate mass spectrometry. Clearly we're seeing some initial traction or things like the food screener module for the wine profiler, the honey profiler, these things are getting traction. Whereas that you expect things that cost $10 million or more, people are excited about them, people see the scientific need, but the fundraising there takes much longer.
I hope that has addressed all four parts of your question.
Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC
That was perfect Frank. Thank you so much.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer

Our next question is from Ross Muken at Evercore ISI.
Ross Muken - Evercore ISI
Good afternoon, guys. So obviously, when Charlie departed, there was a lot of concern relative at least on the investor side to sort of the story of the management team and the like even though many of you've been together for a while. But then, you added two really impressive board members which you mentioned and then, you brought on Rene not long ago. And clearly, you are a much, much strong organization, at least optically to us.
From an operation standpoint, is there any way you can give us some – that I know not everyone's been there for quite a long time yet, but any way you can give us some like anecdotal stories or examples, where these three individuals who came from obviously, much larger and diversified companies that had maybe a bit better of an operating trajectory historically? Give us examples of how they've already start to input, maybe add to the business? And how you've incorporated some of the ideas to sort of helping drive what seemingly have been better results here in the business? Obviously, a lot of this has been many years in the making. I'm just trying to get a sense for some of the new voices.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay. I'll start with Rene because this is his – really his day four. He's my kind of guy, he started working on Sunday, on November 1. So, and he had an entire Saturday of vacation between jobs, so I'm optimistic that he will be a hard worker. He's a very experienced guy and his very deep very technical background in innovation and R&D experience, including R&D management, but he really has outstanding operational experience. And operational defined very broad not only manufacturing or logistics or procurement. So, I think that's one of the areas as you know, our operational and commercial excellence initiative. The lean initiative you've never done, we've implemented some of that, but you know, he has the experience, that he shared with me, that you can really do round after round after round, then you get a little better, each time. And so driving, that relentlessly along with innovation, and he already visited, his first four customers in Cambridge, and Boston, this morning. So, that – those are the anecdotes for Rene, but it's very early days, so we'll have to observe that.

Hermann Requardt on the board, I mean – he obviously, has so much experience that's immediately applicable to our preclinical imaging business. Because he did the clinical imaging, at Siemens, as one of the world leaders, and so we have a lot of insight there from technology to trends to funding to – while patient reimbursement doesn't affect us. So, we're learning a lot from him about – what to do, and what not to do, very valuable, and – he's just been, at one board meeting so far, it's early days.
John Ornell is very active; he is sort of my partner, for the CFO search. And I think, we're also learning a lot of things, about long-term tax planning – things that won't have an effect, not even on next year very much, but over time, can add up. So he is an audit committee member, we're learning a lot from him, also on systems implementations, so incredibly valuable sounding board, it helps that he lives locally here, so we get to see him not only at board meetings, but sort of in some ways coaching us a little bit on a number of topics. And those are my anecdotes, for the moment, it's all early days for all three of them.

Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Great thanks for that...
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Very poor audio Jonathan. Anything you can do about that?
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Sorry, do you hear me okay.
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
Yeah, John, you're better now, go ahead. You can ask your question.
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. I was just saying geographically, obviously Japan and China are two significant markets for you, can you maybe just give a little bit more color on what's interesting in those geographies?
Joshua S. Young - Vice President-Investor Relations
Yeah, John. This is Joshua. So, last quarter we talked about Japan being a point of weakness in the business. We saw those trends continue in the third quarter. In Japan, we saw weak revenue and weak orders with reasonable declines. In terms of China, you know China we had a slow start to the year, but I'd say we certainly are seeing mixed results in some businesses. We're doing quite well in China, for example Daltonics and others not so well. The way that will shake out though is we still expect growth in both revenue and new order bookings for the full year in China.
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. And then also I may have missed this, can you give some color on the MALDI-TOF, the (54:14) business and kind of what you are expecting there over the next bit?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. This is Frank. So that continues to be healthy even in Europe where of course the market – you know we've been in the market much longer, the aftermarket business is growing very rapidly. We're expecting for the full year healthy growth in the Americas, which is what we expected because we now have – or as of earlier in the year we had our second FDA claim accepted. And in China, we've seen very healthy market development year-to-date and expect more of that as we also got Chinese FDA clearance late last year. So its particular strength in China and the U.S. and very satisfactory in general and also as predicted particular strength and now rapidly growing from a smaller base, but rapidly growing aftermarket business for the multi biocipher.
Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Frank, could you quantify that how big that business is now or how big you are expecting you see by the end of the year?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Very broadly in the $80 million to $100 million range. I don't think we want disclose exact figures, nor do I have it at my finger tips.

Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. All right.

Next question is from Tycho Peterson at JPMorgan.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey, guys. The positive price mix dynamic you called out, was that specific to NMR or you kind of seeing an ability to kind of extract broader price increases across the portfolio?
Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
It was specific to NMR. We had a few high margin shipments, some of which benefited from timing. And if you look at, we had lower NMR gross profit shipments in the previous third quarter. So most of the product mix effects came from NMR.
Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Okay. And then, on the weakness in NANO, can you may be just, Frank, talk a little bit about how you think about the cycle here? How long you think the order book here remains depressed and with the bolt-on you did there, does that smooth out a little bit of the cyclicality for that business?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that the, that business, that's an ongoing business there. They are not only depending on the cycle, but also on technology adoption and technology adoption and first pilot systems. That's a steadier process. Of course, what we really would like to see is the technology adoption where we think we're in very, very good position for the next decade quite candidly and without having to wait for a decade even as we go from 14 nanometer to 10 nanometer eventually seven nanometer and five nanometer and of course, the trend toward 3D FinFET structures infrastructure in memory end process is ongoing already anyway. But the cycle to build capacity that has not really been satisfactory for anybody in the metrology business, but we do know it's coming back it's an usually long down cycle. But we're kind of feel good about that first of all we don't have too much exposure as a company overall, we do get the technology adoption part throughout and you were all patiently waiting for the cycle to pick up that will be the gravy, but in the meantime that's the situation.
I think some of the other industrial markets you're not surprised to hear, sometimes there are elements of that that's the Wall Street Journal business that's what you read about, so they are they didn't get stronger in the last three months to six months. Keep in mind that NANO also has made a very conscious effort to have more of its mix from academic research and biology and life science research, particularly the florescent microscopy, florescent microscopy super resolution and multi-photon, those acquisitions that we did in the previous year that's getting into gear. So the mix of NANO is also changing along the way in a way that in some areas where we see favorable funding trends from the brain initiative or from investments in cell biology. So it's a mixed bag, it's not all just dependent on steel or metals or cement or so, although there is some elements of that we'll become more diversified and in some areas, we simply, in addition to the cycle, which we can't control and which isn't that favorable, where our technology adoption curves, where we're almost a must on that adoption curve and we're branching out more into life sciences. So, it's strategically changing over time from the NANO that perhaps you remember from two years or three years ago. I hope that helps, that may have been too much color.

The next question is from Isaac Ro at Goldman Sachs.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question here. Frank, maybe just a high level question on the CFO search, could you maybe give us an update on the progress there in terms of the pipeline kind of the qualities of the candidates you're currently evaluating, maybe when we might know a little more there. Thank you.

Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's a very active search and we're clearly looking at candidates and we're getting to see some good candidates. We have good external candidates and internal candidates. We believe that, we're going to make a decision most likely in the first quarter of next year and at this point, it's just an intense process, that's proceeding and so I would think that we most likely will make a decision in the first quarter of next year.
Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. And then, just one product specific question on Biotyper. I think, you mentioned in the prepared comments, that it was strong, I was curious, if you could maybe try to put a little more color on what it contributed to growth. And then, more importantly, where do you think we are in the product life cycle. I gather that we are still somewhat early days, based on I think our last conversation at ASM this year. But just curious on, as you think about sort of in baseball terms, what inning we are in, and maybe from here what kind of general investment you think, that you need to make to realize the opportunity, that'll be great. Thank you, guys.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I mean, for the Biotyper, we don't want to get too granular in giving its growth rate and stuff. But it has healthy growth rates. It has – and has had for a number of years the highest growth rate within the Daltonics business as you know and we don't see that trend changing dramatically even though it's a larger business. So the growth rates are good and we've also said directionally in the past and that continues to be true that its gross margins are above CALID average or Bruker average.
To your – to the further questions, I think it depends a little bit what geography we're talking about. In Europe maybe we're in the fifth inning or something like that, and now of course aftermarket – there is a lot more established. We are much further along. Aftermarket, it's now starting to play a role in – first customers are also experimenting where they presently research use only not approved yet, resistance testing and approaches to maybe even to do susceptibility testing on that platform, which might add another S curve to the identification capabilities eventually and that's early days. I think in the U.S., we are perhaps in the third inning and in China in the second. So they're still early days and still a lot of, lot of potential. I hope that's helpful.

The next question is from Dan Arias with Citi.
Bryan Kipp - Citigroup
Hi. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Just a question on pacing in the quarter, just around the color you guys gave on the kind of the implied growth rate for 4Q. How did the October pace just – and in conjunction with that, did you expect the $6 million ROSATOM to come forward in the back half of the year, can you remind me there?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We expected that in the second half of the year and during the quarter, it became clear that it's going to move out of Q3 and into Q4.
Bryan Kipp - Citigroup
And the pacing in the fourth quarter in the sense of – I know you guys are still working through your ERP system and trying to have visibility at month end. How is it pacing so far in the fourth quarter, just trying to get a sense of the plus and minus $15 million is still what you are thinking? Thank you.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think we find out the plus or minus $15 million in the last three days or four days of each quarter. It's literally there so many installations and acceptances that I have no increased visibility and I wouldn't have it internally even by middle of December. It's literally whether or not we may exceed by up to $15 million. I mean that's – that's at the high end of the variability or might be lower that really gets determined in many ways fundamentally and even with better systems and sort of the last week of each quarter. That's no different in Q4 and then that actually would be more or less also true in the Q3 or Q2. So the pace – the pacing is on track. There's nothing remarkable there in Q4.

Bryan Kipp - Citigroup
And just a higher level question, kind of more around strategy. You guys have not emerged not in a bad way, but on talking to you at length in regards to the rationalization of the portfolio, right-sizing the business and streamlining the company. These tangible changes are helpful, but just thinking where are you guys are going forward in terms of product portfolio kind of dynamic? Do you have any interest in moving further downstream or do you think it's going to be five years to 10 years from now, the identity of Bruker is still going to be a leading kind of more upstream research analytical instrument provide?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I wouldn't want to use the category downstream or upstream. But more we're looking for defensible high-margin areas where we can be one of the leading players and that can be a $10 million ultra-high field NMR system that's clearly what you would call a very high-end and perhaps upstream that can be a €50,000 or $50,000 explosive trace detector has new libraries and technology that goes far beyond what's generally has been found at airports before. So, there, I would say we're very – we are not only a high-end only company. We're looking for high performance kind of sometimes come in innovative small packages or in user friendly packages with great content like the MALDI Biotyper. That's not the most high-end MALDI (01:05:36) or mass spectrometer that's out there, but it's incredibly powerful solution because of the libraries and assays and consumables that come with it.
So, we're much less a niche high-end company today, but we still look to leverage performance for good margins and that can be really at either end of the market wherever we think we can find interesting profit and margin pools where we think we can have defensible positions.

Our next question is from Bryan Brokmeier at Cantor Fitzgerald.
Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Hi. Good evening. Since introducing the Tissuetyper, how is the development of the library then?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Very early days, very early days, Bryan. So, there is some early adopters that are now ordering this system, and they will all be – in most cases, they will all be collaboration partners. This will – this in some ways will be a team sport, not unlike for the MALDI Biotyper, where there is no way that we can develop all the contents or library in-house, and so, we rely on many different collaborators to – who explore and discover new areas. And then, we help organize validation, if they think they've discovered something, you've got to do it on multiple systems in multiple labs. So, it's very early days. But in the meantime, even as there's no validated assays yet, it's in a system that generates a lot of excitement because of it, incredible tissue or anatomical pathology research capabilities. So, we benefit initially now from the research-oriented customers.
Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities
Okay. And in the quarter, I guess really over the last couple of quarters, were any of the improvements that you're seeing – were any of the improvements you're seeing that has allowed for customers to take deliveries in these – from the fourth quarter into the third quarter? Is any of that a result of things you've done year-to-date? Or was it really just up to the customer and the customer readiness?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Very strong execution in Q3. We really worked it at very hard, and that means, you lose some customers because they're not ready and you work with others. And you just make sure that we don't add to it by incomplete shipment or quality or not properly planning our resources. So I really think the BioSpin colleagues and others in CALID and elsewhere, I think they just – I think our execution is getting better and better. I think our management processes, and information systems are getting better. They're not perfect yet, but I think there is a lot of improvement and it's pretty steady.

Anthony L. Mattacchione - CFO, Senior VP-Corporate Finance & Accounting
And just one point of detail here. It's not that customers are taking shipments, it's that we're completing installations of systems earlier than expected and they're meeting the specs as well.

William March - Janney Montgomery Scott
Hi, this is actually Bill March on for Paul. How you guys doing?
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good. How are you?
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott
Doing well. I was just hoping you could provide a little more color on the recent Jordan Valley acquisition? And then, how we should think about kind of the pacing and/or lumpiness of revenue within that segment? Thank you.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Bill. So we've given some color on the rationale behind the Jordan Valley technology. The X-ray metrology technology that they're pursuing, we think they can strengthen that even further with some of the components and other technologies that we can contribute, so there's some nice technical synergies, there's also some sales and customer support and service synergies between their global setup and our global setup that's all coming together nicely.
We have given some guidance that we think this will be that their revenue next year might be somewhere around $25 million, so Bill, what they contribute the remainder of this year will be negligible, but what they contribute next year might be around $25 million, and we expect this to be $0.01 to $0.02 accretive to non-GAAP EPS next year.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott
Just then a quick follow-up, just thinking about the revenue pacing, do you think that they'll have kind of a consistent mix or do you think that it could be kind of quarter-to-quarter or you could see lumpier revenues? Thanks.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, since they have high ticket items, I'm sure that particular business will have lumpiness, no question about it, but the more different businesses we have, these lumpiness are not in phase, so to speak, so within the much larger revenue stream of Bruker, I don't think this will materially or perhaps in anyway increase our lumpiness overall.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott
That's helpful.
Frank H. Laukien - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Standalone business, yes, but at the Bruker level, it's the lumpiness, doesn't make such a big difference.
William March - Janney Montgomery Scott
Great. Thanks for your help. Have a good evening.
Operator
That is all the time allotted for the call. I would like to turn the conference back over to Joshua Young for any closing remarks.
Joshua S. Young - Vice President-Investor Relations
I want to thank everyone, for joining us this evening. If you're interested in meeting with Bruker management, we'll be presenting at the Citi and Credit Suisse Healthcare Conferences during the fourth quarter and the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference at San Francisco, in January 2016. We also invite you to visit us at our headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts.
Thank for your attention and have a nice night.
Operator
The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.
