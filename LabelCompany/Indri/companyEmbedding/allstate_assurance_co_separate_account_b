Filing a claim can be an emotional time. Allstate is here to help you every step of the way, making your claims experience as simple and convenient as possible. With one of the largest teams of claims professionals in the country and 24/7 claims support, we'll work to help you get back to normal quickly.

Log in to file a claim 


Register for My Account


If you haven’t registered for My Account, you can  still file a claim online. Flood claims  are handled differently, but you can still file a  flood claim online.


More Ways To File A Claim.

To make filing a claim quick and convenient, Allstate provides you with many ways to file a claim:

Access 24/7 claims service by calling 1-800-ALLSTATE.
Start your claim using the Allstate® Mobile app. 
Report your claim by contacting your agent.



What To Expect During The Claims Process.

Knowing what to expect when you file a claim can help make the process easier to navigate. Though different types of claims are handled a little differently, most Allstate claims follow the same basic steps.



Step 1: File your claim.
Once you file a claim, you'll get a claim number that will help you track your claim.







Step 2: Investigate claim.
We may need to investigate the details of your loss. If so, one of our claims professionals will walk you through the process and answer all of your questions or concerns.







Step 3: Evaluate damage.
A professional will assess the damage, determine what needs to be repaired or replaced and provide you with an estimate.







Step 4: Review estimate.
Once you've received an estimate of the damage, your claims adjuster will discuss your settlement based on your policy provisions, terms and coverage.







Step 5: Wrap up your claim.
Your claims adjuster may send you any applicable payments and can answer any questions you may have.






Staying organized can help you keep track of your claim. Writing your claim number on important documents is a good tip to keep in mind. If you have an auto claim, the auto insurance claim worksheet can help you keep everything straight.

Allstate Life Insurance Company: No-Action Letter dated December 23, 2002
















Home | Previous Page






























No-Action Letter under
Securities Act of 1933 - Sections 5 and 8
Allstate Life Insurance Company
December 23, 2002
Reponse of the Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Allstate Life Insurance Company, et al.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 23, 2002 and in an application for an exemptive order under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook") or Morgan Stanley DW Inc. under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act,"), if the Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A (the "Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred to Allstate, where it will change its name to Allstate Life Separate Account A, in connection with the proposed merger of Northbrook into Allstate (the "Merger").  We also would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, or Section 11 of the 1940 Act, if the Northbrook Variable Annuity Account and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II (the "Northbrook VA Accounts") are merged with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") (the "Separate Account Mergers") in connection with the Merger.  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if (1) the change in depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger is effected though the filing of an amendment to the registration statement for the Northbrook Life Separate Account under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act are filed by Allstate, the Northbrook Life Separate Account and Allstate Separate Account I to cover any securities issued after the Merger in connection with variable life insurance contracts funded by the Northbrook Life Separate Account and any variable annuity contracts funded by Allstate Separate Account I.
Further, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, without registration under the 1933 Act, Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under certain fixed annuity contracts with market value adjustment features, as a result of which Allstate would assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such contracts.
In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, after consummation of the Merger, Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Separate Account A (formerly Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A), and the other parties named in the exemptive orders cited in your letter, continue to rely on such orders without filing amended or new applications for the same relief previously granted.
Because our position is based on facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.
Alison Toledo
Senior Counsel


[Foley:Lardner Attorneys at Law letterhead]

December 23, 2002
1933 Act/Section 5 and Rule 145
1940 Act/Sections 8 and 11
BY HAND DELIVERY
William J. Kotapish, Esq.
Assistant Director
Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549-0506
Re:  Allstate Life Insurance Company,
Northbrook Life Insurance Company, and
Morgan Stanley DW Inc.
Dear Mr. Kotapish: 
We are writing on behalf of Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook"), and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. ("MSDW") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection with the merger of Northbrook into its parent, Allstate (the "Merger"), described below.  This letter replaces our letter to you of August 30, 2002, and reflects changes agreed upon with the Commission staff.
Specifically, Allstate, Northbrook, and MSDW are seeking the staff's assurances that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action:
under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A ("Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred intact to Allstate, as described below (the "Separate Account Transfer"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder or Section 11 of the 1940 Act if Northbrook Variable Annuity Account ("Northbrook VA") and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II ("Northbrook VA II," together with Northbrook VA, the "Northbrook VA Accounts") merge with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") and consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts ("consolidated sub-accounts"), as described below (the "Separate Account Mergers"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Northbrook MVA Contracts"),  Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and Allstate assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such Contracts, as described below (the "Fixed Account Transfer"); and  
after consummation of the Merger, if Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, and certain others described herein continue to rely on the exemptive orders identified herein obtained on behalf of Northbrook, the Northbrook  Separate Accounts, and any other parties named therein without the filing or submission of amended or new applications for the same exemptive relief.

The Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account (collectively, the "Northbrook Separate Accounts") were created under Arizona law and each is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.3   The Northbrook VA Accounts fund six variable annuity contracts ("Northbrook VA Contracts"), and Northbrook Life Separate Account funds one variable life insurance contract ("Northbrook VLI Contract," and, together with the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Northbrook MVA Contracts, the "Northbrook Contracts"). Units of interest in each Northbrook Separate Account are registered under the 1933 Act.4 
All of the Northbrook Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Northbrook is licensed, with the exception of the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity, the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II, and the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II AssetManager.5   The Northbrook VA and VLI Contracts generally permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.
The above separate accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act (each, an "Underlying Fund," collectively, the "Underlying Funds").  Currently, Allstate Separate Account I consists of 59 sub-accounts, Northbrook Life Separate Account consists of 20 sub-accounts, Northbrook VA consists of 11 sub-accounts, and Northbrook VA II consists of 53 sub-accounts. Several of the sub-accounts available under the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Allstate Contracts invest in the same Underlying Funds; however, those sub-accounts each have different accumulation unit values due to the different charges imposed under those Contracts.  Each of the Allstate Contracts and Northbrook Contracts also offer one or more general account options that are not registered under the 1933 Act. 
D. Northbrook MVA Contracts
The Northbrook MVA Contracts are flexible premium deferred fixed annuity contracts that are offered to individuals and to eligible groups. They have no variable investment options.  Northbrook holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Northbrook MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account that is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Market value adjustment interests in the Northbrook MVA Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.6
E. Underwriter 
MSDW, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., is the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts.  MSDW was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1968.  MSDW is registered with the Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
II. The Proposed Transactions
A. The Merger
Northbrook will merge with and into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Articles of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement") approved by the Boards of Directors of Allstate and Northbrook.  The Merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of Arizona and Illinois, the states of domicile for Northbrook and Allstate, respectively.  Allstate and Northbrook expect to consummate the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, on or about January 1, 2003 (the "Effective Date").
As a result of the Merger, Allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and will become directly liable for Northbrook's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Northbrook Contracts then outstanding.7  Each Northbrook Contract owner will become a contract owner of Allstate by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Northbrook Contracts. Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Northbrook Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Northbrook Contracts.  The Merger will not affect any current Allstate Contract owners.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Northbrook Separate Accounts or Allstate Separate Account I in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.8
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated. Each sub-account of the Northbrook Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Underlying Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. 
The Merger will not directly affect any of the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Underlying Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.   No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Underlying Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Underlying Funds, the Underlying Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Underlying Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, the Merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts. 
Allstate and Northbrook have determined that no provision of the Northbrook Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts ("Northbrook Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger. Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Northbrook Separate Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Northbrook Contract owners under the 1940 Act. In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Northbrook Contracts will not change, except that Allstate will become the depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts. Consequently, Northbrook Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.   
After the Merger, Allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Northbrook Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Northbrook Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.  Allstate will administer the Northbrook Contracts in the same manner as did Northbrook immediately prior to the Merger. 
All costs of the Merger will be borne by Allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of Northbrook or Allstate Contracts (each, a "Contract owner," and collectively, the "Contract owners"). 
B. The Separate Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook Life Separate Account will transfer intact to Allstate and become part of Allstate on the Effective Date.  It will change its name to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and have Allstate as its depositor rather than Northbrook. No other changes to Northbrook Life Separate Account will result from the Merger.  
The assets and liabilities that comprise Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Allstate, as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, Northbrook Life Separate Account will continue to fund the same Contracts it did immediately prior to the Merger. 
C. The Separate Account Mergers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Northbrook VA Accounts will merge with Allstate Separate Account I on the Effective Date.  To achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings, Allstate will consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Fund. 
The consolidation of the sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Northbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account.9   The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent.  The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation. 
The Separate Account Mergers will not affect the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts that are not duplicative.  Those sub-accounts will remain intact within Allstate Separate Account I and their net asset values immediately after the Merger will be the same as they were immediately before the Merger.  
D. The Fixed Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts to Allstate, and Allstate will assume Northbrook's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date. As a result of the Merger,  each non-unitized separate account of Northbrook that funds the Northbrook MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Allstate. At the same time, Allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Northbrook under the Northbrook MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger. 
The Fixed Account Transfer will not change the terms of the Northbrook MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Allstate as the insurer under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts. 
E. Procedural Matters
Allstate will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and Allstate's assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook under the Northbrook VA Contracts and Northbrook VLI Contract. Allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  Existing Northbrook Contract owners (other than Northbrook VLI Contract owners) will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of the Northbrook Separate Accounts as a result of the Merger.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.  Northbrook VLI Contract owners will receive a new Form N-6 prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.
Allstate also will file new registration statements on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Northbrook MVA Contracts.  Allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date. These new registration statements would reflect Allstate's assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook with respect to the Northbrook MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Northbrook MVA Contract at the time of the Fixed Account Transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate as the issuer of the Contract.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
In compliance with applicable state law, Allstate, and Northbrook will notify the owners of the Northbrook Contracts that Allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under those Contracts.
Following the Effective Date, Allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the Northbrook Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III. Discussion
For the reasons discussed below, we are of the view that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder do not apply to the Proposed Transactions.  We also are of the view, as discussed below, that Section 8 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer, and that Section 11 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers.  Finally, we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to Northbrook and other named parties prior to the Merger10 may continue to be relied upon after the Merger by Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications. 
The staff has responded favorably to no-action requests dealing with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act noted above regarding transactions similar to the Separate Account Transfer,11 the Separate Account Mergers,12  and the Fixed Account Transfer.13 We respectfully submit that the Proposed Transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those no-action requests.
A. Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder Do Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, or the Fixed Account Transfer
1. Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the Separate Account Transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Transfer would not change the Northbrook VLI Contracts, except that, by operation of law, Allstate would succeed Northbrook as the depositor of Northbrook Life Separate Account and co-issuer of the Contracts and would, accordingly, guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the Contracts.14 These rights and benefits (e.g., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by Allstate's larger pool of assets. Cash values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts that are allocated to the Northbrook Life Separate Account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the Separate Account, and its sub-accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds.  The unit values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts offered by Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A immediately after the Separate Account Transfer would be the same as under the Contracts offered by Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before. The Separate Account Transfer, therefore, would not affect those aspects of the Northbrook VLI Contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities, e.g., the investment options available through the Separate Account.
The Separate Account Transfer would have no effect on the Northbrook Life Separate Account, except for the succession of Allstate as depositor and co-issuer described above, and except for the change in name of that Separate Account to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A. The assets and liabilities that comprise the Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before the Separate Account Transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of Allstate.   The financial history of the Northbrook Life Separate Account would be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Allstate, would not change. 
As discussed above, Contract owners will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, Contract Owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Separate Account Transfer.  
Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 14515 thereunder do not apply to the Separate Account Transfer. 
2. Separate Account Mergers
In our view, the Separate Account Mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Mergers would not result in any change to the Northbrook VA Contracts, except that Allstate would succeed Northbrook as depositor and as co-issuer of the Contracts. The rights and benefits under the Northbrook VA Contracts would remain the same, all of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook VA Accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds, the Northbrook VA Contract values immediately following the Merger will be the same as immediately before, and Contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision, since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the Merger. 
The change in depositor following the Merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding.  The identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations. For example, the depositor, in effect, guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit, notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question, and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required, regardless of whether the relevant contract's account value has already been depleted thereby.  We respectfully submit, therefore, that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the Northbrook Contracts, rather than to those aspects of the Contracts that constitute (or cause the Contracts to be) securities. This argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security.  
Moreover, even if the Separate Account Mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of  new or different securities, such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of Section 5 or Rule 145, because Contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the Separate Account Mergers.  Accordingly, the Contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an "offer" or "sale" to occur that would bring Section 5 into play.  Nor, in this case, will there be the kind of security holder action that, under the terms of the rule, is required to bring Rule 145 into play.
3. Fixed Account Transfer 
In our view, the Fixed Account Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Northbrook MVA Contracts by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, except that Allstate will succeed Northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Northbrook MVA Contracts. These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Northbrook will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts intact to Allstate. Consequently, when the Fixed Account Transfer becomes effective, Allstate will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Fixed Account Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Fixed Account Transfer.
B. Section 8 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the succession of Allstate to the position of depositor for the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.   
The Merger will cause a change in the depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that Separate Account.  However, the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the Northbrook Life Separate Account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the Northbrook VLI Contracts or to the Contract owners.  The Northbrook Life Separate Account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  
The Commission's "ectoplasmic" theory,16 in our view, supports the position that Northbrook Life Separate Account, as such, will have a continuing, uninterrupted existence, notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets. Although the assets of Northbrook Life Separate Account will become assets of Allstate, such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account, and, for financial reporting purposes, the Separate Account will be treated as a continuing separate entity. 
Accordingly, to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the Northbrook Life Separate Account from Northbrook to Allstate following the consummation of the Merger, Allstate and the Separate Account will file a new registration statement on Form N-6 that will constitute an amendment to the Separate Account's existing registration under the 1940 Act.  The Form N-6 registration statement also will register, under the 1933 Act, any securities transactions effected under the Northbrook VLI  Contracts after the Merger.  Allstate will file the Form N-6 registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the Merger. 
C. Section 11 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers
Based on the foregoing analysis, we also believe that the Separate Account Transfer does not involve an exchange of securities (the separate account interests in the Northbrook VLI Contracts) issued by an investment company (the Northbrook VLI Separate Account) for securities of any other investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.   In addition, for the reasons discussed above, we believe that the Separate Account Mergers do not involve an "offer of exchange" within the meaning of Section 11.   However, should the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11, we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of Section 11(a) and Rule 11a-2(b)(2) thereunder, because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values. Thus, Commission approval of such transactions should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act. 
D. Continued Reliance on Prior Exemptive Relief Is Appropriate
We believe the exemptions under the 1940 Act17 that Northbrook, the Northbrook Separate Accounts, and the other parties named therein have received from the Commission or its staff should continue to apply after the Merger to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and other parties named therein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief.  Their continued applicability is appropriate because the Merger will not change the operations of Allstate Separate Account I, nor its relationship to its depositor, any other separate account, or Contract owners.  The only changes  resulting from the Merger are: (i) the substitution of Allstate for Northbrook as depositor for the Northbrook Separate Accounts and as co-issuer and insurer of the Northbrook Contracts, (ii) the transfer of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts to Allstate Separate Account I, (iii) the transfer of Northbrook Life Separate Account to Allstate, and (iv) the consolidation of the transferred sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Funds.  It is our view that such changes have no impact upon, and are not relevant to, the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions.  In support of our view, we note that the Commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several no-action letters.18
IV. No-Action Request
Based upon the above facts and circumstances, we respectfully request that the Commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, or under Section 8 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer, and Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers.
In addition, we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, will continue to be applicable after the Effective Date, in the manner described above, to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance.
If you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me, Chip Lunde (202-295-4016), or Charles Smith of Allstate (847-402-1790).
Very truly yours,

14  Some state insurance departments will require an endorsement to outstanding policies to reflect the change of issuer. 
15   Rule 145 under the 1933 Act provides, in pertinent part, that certain business combinations, including certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of assets, will be deemed to involve the "offer" or "sale" of securities requiring registration under the Act under circumstances where existing security holders are in effect asked to make an investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for a security they presently own. Even if the Merger were deemed to be a "transfer of assets" for purposes of Rule 145, it is clear that the Rule does not apply because the Contract owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction. For these reasons, we believe that Rule 145 is inapplicable to the Merger.

MESSAGE TO PARTICIPANTS IN                                                      
PROVIDENT NATIONAL'S                                                            
VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS 

This annual report of Separate Account B contains the financial statements and  
portfolio information of Separate Account B for the twelve months ended December
31, 2000. Comparative figures that relate to Separate Account B's activities    
during the year of 2000 are provided below.                                     

The accumulation value for Separate Account B decreased 13.1% for the year 2000,
from 19.18 at year-end 1999 to 16.66 on December 31, 2000. During this same     
period the S & P 500 index declined by a yield adjusted 9.1%. Reflecting        
transfers to the fixed-dollar account, as well as withdrawals and retirements,  
the number of accumulation units outstanding on December 31, 2000 was 361,853   
down from 609,502 twelve months earlier. As a result of withdrawals, net        
purchase payments received, and changes in the accumulation unit value, total   
contract owners' equity on December 31, 2000 was 7,829,040 compared to          
14,186,833 on December 31, 1999.                                                

After five years of 20%-plus annual equity performance, the market and your fund
finally took a breather. Furthermore, large, high-quality growth company stocks 
performed far worse than smaller, low-growth stocks. For example, the highest   
growth quintile of the S&P 500 index was down 27% in 2000 versus the lowest     
growth quintile up 17%. Nervousness about the economy sent investors running for
safety at the expense of long-term growth. Now with the Federal Reserve         
aggressively cutting interest rates and the likelihood of a federal tax cut, we 
believe the economy will improve and investors will value sound growth prospects
more rationally. We are using this period of market turmoil to better           
strategically position the portfolio to benefit from the areas of the economy   
that will show the strongest performance long-term. We are confident in the     
eventual improvement of the economy, the stock market, and in your fund's       
performance.                                                                    

Thank you for your continued support.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  

Board of Managers and Contract Owners                                           
Provident National Assurance Company                                            
Separate Account B                                                          

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of        
Provident National Assurance Company Separate Account B as of December 31, 2000 
and 1999, including the schedule of investments as of December 31, 2000, and the
related statements of operations and changes in contract owners' equity for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, and the supplementary 
information for each of the ten years in the period then ended. These financial 
statements and supplementary information are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements and supplementary information based on our audits.                   

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and       
supplementary information are free of material misstatement. An audit includes  
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities    
owned as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and    
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall     
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a          
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the financial statements and supplementary information referred 
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of    
Provident National Assurance Company Separate Account B at December 31, 2000 and
1999, the results of its operations and the changes in contract owners' equity  
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000, and the      
supplementary information for each of the ten years in the period then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in those statements and        
accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from such estimates.              

Common stocks are valued at published market quotations which represent the     
closing sales price for securities traded on a national stock exchange or the   
mean between the quoted bid and asked prices for those traded over-the-counter. 
Short-term investments are valued at cost plus accrued interest.                

Realized and unrealized gains and losses are credited to or charged to contract 
owners' equity. The identified cost basis has been used in determining realized 
gains and losses on sales of investments. There were gross unrealized gains of  
$3,474,407 and gross unrealized losses of $632,463 at December 31, 2000.        
Security transactions are recorded on the day after the securities are purchased
or sold. Dividends are taken into income on an accrual basis as of the ex-      
dividend date.

sold for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 is shown below.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued                                       

Provident National Assurance Company Separate Account B                         

December 31, 2000
NOTE B--FEDERAL INCOME TAXES                                                    

Operations of Separate Account B will form a part of the income tax return of   
Provident National Assurance Company, which is taxed as a "life insurance       
company" under the Internal Revenue Code.                                       

Under current law, no federal income taxes are payable with respect to Separate 
Account B.                                                                      

NOTE C--EXPENSES                                                                

Deductions are made by Provident National Assurance Company at the end of each  
valuation period for investment advisory services and for mortality and expense 
assurances, which on an annual basis are approximately .50% and .70%,           
respectively, of the net assets of Separate Account B.                          

NOTE D--COMMITMENTS                                                             

In 2000, UnumProvident Corporation agreed on terms to sell the Provident        
National Assurance Company corporate shell, including the Separate Account B    
assets and liabilities, to Allstate Life Insurance Company. This transaction is 
expected to close in the first quarter of 2001 and will have no impact on the   
contract owners of Separate Account B.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application

company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov/search/search.htm, or by

I. Applicants’ Representations
1. The Separate Account was
established as a managed separate
account of the Company on August 21,
1967, for the purpose of funding certain
variable annuity contracts (the
‘‘Contracts’’). The Separate Account is
registered as an open-end management
investment company under the Act (File
No. 811–01525).
2. The Separate Account has retained
Provident Investment Management,
LLC, to serve as the investment adviser
to the Separate Account and The
Variable Annuity Life Insurance
Company and The Paul Revere Life
Insurance Company to provide
administrative services to the Separate
Account. A Board of Managers, a
majority of which consists of persons
who are independent of the Separate
Account within the meaning of the Act,
currently oversees the Separate
Account’s operations.
3. The Separate Account is one of two
investment options available under the
Contracts. The other investment option
under the Contracts is the Company’s
general account, which pays a fixed rate
of interest (‘‘Fixed Account’’). As of

VerDate Sep<11>2014

16:31 Feb 01, 2017

Jkt 241001

September 30, 2016, there were a total
of 125 individual Contract owners, only
47 of whom were invested in the
Separate Account. Contract owners may
transfer account assets between the
Fixed Account and the Separate
Account but only once every 12 months.
4. Redemptions have significantly
reduced the Separate Account’s assets
over the past decade and are likely to
continue notwithstanding any positive
investment performance that may result
in a net increase in the Separate
Account’s assets. As of September 30,
2016, the Separate Account had
approximately $800,000 in total net
assets.
5. The public offering of the Contracts
under the Securities Act of 1933
(‘‘Securities Act’’) was initially
registered in 1967 (File No. 2–27135).
The Company discontinued the sale of
new Contracts in 1984. Although the
Contracts allow Contract owners to
make additional contributions, the
Company has not received an additional
contribution under the Contracts since
November 2006, which was allocated to
the Fixed Account. No contributions or
transfers have been allocated to the
Separate Account since 2002. The
Company has no intention of offering
the Contracts to new purchasers, and
conducts no solicitation or marketing
activities with respect to the Contracts.
II. Applicants’ Legal Analysis
1. Applicants respectfully request that
the Commission, pursuant to Section
6(c) of the Act, issue an Order granting
an exemption from all provisions of the
Act, subject to the conditions set out in
Section III, below. Applicants believe,
based on the grounds set out in the
application, that the requested
exemption meets the standards of
Section 6(c) of the Act.
2. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes
the Commission to ‘‘conditionally or
unconditionally exempt any person,
security, or transaction, or any class or
classes of persons, securities, or
transactions, from the provisions of [the
Act] or of any rule or regulation
thereunder, if and to the extent that
such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest and
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
[the Act.]’’
3. Applicants believe that the
requested exemption is appropriate in
the public interest and consistent with
the protection of investors and the
purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Section
3(c)(1) of the Act makes clear that
Congress intended to exclude from the

PO 00000

Frm 00030

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

Act entities in which there is no
significant public interest.1 As noted
above, only 47 individual beneficial
owners are currently invested in the
Separate Account, well below the 100
person limit of Section 3(c)(1). In
addition, the Company discontinued the
sale of new Contracts in 1984. Likewise,
the Separate Account has not received
any additional Contract owner money in
over a decade. No salesperson is
engaged in any solicitation or marketing
activity with respect to the Contracts or
the Separate Account, and no
compensation is being paid for any such
activity. The Company has no intention
of offering the Contracts to new
purchasers, or encouraging any
investments in the Separate Account
and will not do so if the Order is
granted. Although the terms and
conditions of the Contracts permit
Contract owners to make future
allocations to or investments in the
Separate Account, Applicants assert that
the Separate Account’s historical
experience strongly suggests that the
likelihood of receiving any such
allocation or investment is remote.
4. In addition, Applicants state that
Contract owners do not need the
protections afforded by the Act.
Applicants assert that Contract owners
are adequately protected by the fact that
their longstanding relationship with the
Company of over 30 years is established
by the terms and conditions of the
Contracts, which may not be changed
without Contract owner approval except
where permitted or required by
applicable law. The Contracts, among
other things, fix the fees and charges
(including management fees) associated
with the Separate Account, thus
distinguishing the Separate Account
from mutual funds whose expenses can
change periodically. The Contracts also
confer upon owners the right to receive
at least annually a statement (a)
reflecting the investment results for the
prior year, (b) listing the investments of
the Separate Account as of the date of
the statement, and (c) reflecting the
value of the accumulation units credited
to the Contracts. Moreover, after the
date of the Order requested by the
application, Applicants will provide
Contract owners with annual audited
financial statements of the Company
and the Separate Account pursuant to
proposed condition 5 described below.
In addition, the Contracts are governed
by and administered according to state
1 H.R. Rep. No. 96–1341 at 35 (1980); S. Rep. No.
96–958 at 20 (1980). (‘‘Section 3(c)(1) was intended
to exclude from the Act private companies in which
there is no significant public interest and which are
therefore not appropriate subjects of federal
regulation.’’)

insurance law, which requires that the
Company maintain in the Separate
Account assets with a value at least
equal to the reserves and other contract
liabilities with respect to the Separate
Account; that the income, gains and
losses, realized or unrealized, from
assets allocated to the Separate Account
be credited to or charged against the
Separate Account, without regard to
other income, gains or losses of the
Company; and that assets of the
Separate Account equal to the reserves
and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Separate Account not be
charged with liabilities arising out of
any other business the Company may
conduct. Furthermore, the requested
relief would be subject to the other
conditions described in Section III,
below.
5. Applicants state that there is very
little Contract owner interest in the
Separate Account. The last time a
premium was received under a Contract
was in November 2006, and the last
time a premium or transfer was
allocated to the Separate Account was
in 2002. The Separate Account’s assets
have been declining due to redemptions
over the past decade and are likely to
continue to decline as the result of
redemptions.
6. Applicants maintain that granting
the requested relief would enable
Applicants to avoid the difficulties of
trying to efficiently manage the Separate
Account in compliance with the
diversification and other requirements
of the Act as assets dwindle down to
zero. Further, Applicants assert that
granting the requested relief would
enable Applicants to avoid the
significant ongoing legal, accounting,
and other costs of maintaining a
registered investment company, which
costs currently exceed the amount of
revenues generated by the fees under
the Contracts.
7. Applicants submit that the relief is
consistent with the protection of
investors and the purposes fairly
intended by the policy and provisions of
the 1940 Act.
III. Conditions
Applicants consent to the following
conditions to any Order issued by the
Commission:
1. The Company will continue to be
responsible for satisfying all the
obligations to Contract owners as
specified under the terms of their
Contracts. In addition, promptly after
the issuance of the Notice of the
application, the Company will deliver a
written document to all Contract owners
that will state that the Notice has been
issued; that, consequently, after the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

16:31 Feb 01, 2017

Jkt 241001

order granting the relief requested in the
Notice is issued, certain legal
protections afforded to Contract owners
allocating assets to an investment
company registered under the Act no
longer apply to them; that, nevertheless,
the terms and conditions of such
Contracts have not changed; and that
the Company continues to be
responsible for satisfying all the
obligations to such Contract owners as
specified under the terms of their
Contracts. In the event a Contract owner
transfers money from the Fixed Account
to the Separate Account, the Company
and the Separate Account will notify
such transferring Contract owner that
the Separate Account is no longer a
Separate Account registered under the
Act and provide the Contract owner a
one-time opportunity to transfer the
money back into the Fixed Account
prior to the 12 month holding period
required by the Contracts. Any
subsequent transfer by the same
Contract owner from the Fixed Account
to the Separate Account will be subject
to the 12 month holding period required
by the Contracts.
2. The Company will continue to be
responsible for maintaining records of
the values under each owner’s Contract,
providing quarterly statements and
transaction confirmations to Contract
owners, and all other administrative
functions in connection with the
Separate Account. As in the past, the
Company may retain one or more
administrators to provide such services,
but the Company will remain ultimately
responsible therefor.
3. The Separate Account will at all
times continue to be operated in the
manner contemplated by Rule 0–1(e)(1)
and (2) under the Act. Specifically:
(a) The Separate Account will
continue to be an account established
and maintained by an insurance
company pursuant to the laws of a state
or territory of the United States under
which income, gains and losses,
whether or not realized, from assets
allocated to the Separate Account are, in
accordance with the Contracts, credited
to or charged against the Separate
Account without regard to other
income, gains or losses of the insurance
company,
(b) the Separate Account shall be
legally segregated and the assets of the
Separate Account will, at the time
during the year that adjustments in the
reserves are made, have a value at least
equal to the Company’s reserves and
other contract liabilities with respect to
the Separate Account, and, at all other
times, will have a value approximately
equal to or in excess of such reserves
and liabilities, and

PO 00000

Frm 00031

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 9990

9085

(c) that portion of the Separate
Account’s assets having a value equal to
such reserves and contract liabilities
will not be chargeable with liabilities
arising out of any other business that the
Company may conduct.
4. The Company and the Separate
Account will operate in compliance
with applicable state insurance law,
including but not limited to filing
annual audited financial statements of
the Company and the Separate Account
with the insurance department of the
Company’s domiciliary state.
5. The Company will provide Contract
owners invested in the Separate
Account with copies of the annual
audited financial statements of the
Company and the Separate Account.
6. The Company and the Separate
Account will not solicit additional
contributions from Contract owners, or
resume the sale of Contracts, and will
not use the Separate Account to issue
any other annuity contracts that would
require the Separate Account to be
registered under the Act unless so
registered. In addition, the Company
and the Separate Account will not
solicit transfers from the Fixed Account
into the Separate Account. Furthermore,
the Separate Account will not be used
for any other business other than as a
funding vehicle for the Contracts.
7. The Separate Account will reregister under the Act should the
number of beneficial owners invested in
the Separate Account exceed 100.
8. The Separate Account will
continue to create, maintain and keep
current the books and records as set
forth in Rules 31a–1 and 31a–2 under
the Act for the periods specified by
these Rules.
IV. Conclusion
For the reasons and upon the facts set
forth above and in the application,
Applicants submit that their exemptive
request meets the standards set out in
Section 6(c) of the Act and that the
Commission, therefore, should grant the
requested Order.
For the Commission, by the Division of
Investment Management, pursuant to
delegated authority.

Assistant Secretary.

I. Applicants' Representations

    1. The Separate Account was established as a managed separate 
account of the Company on August 21, 1967, for the purpose of funding 
certain variable annuity contracts (the ``Contracts''). The Separate 
Account is registered as an open-end management investment company 
under the Act (File No. 811-01525).
    2. The Separate Account has retained Provident Investment 
Management, LLC, to serve as the investment adviser to the Separate 
Account and The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company and The Paul 
Revere Life Insurance Company to provide administrative services to the 
Separate Account. A Board of Managers, a majority of which consists of 
persons who are independent of the Separate Account within the meaning 
of the Act, currently oversees the Separate Account's operations.
    3. The Separate Account is one of two investment options available 
under the Contracts. The other investment option under the Contracts is 
the Company's general account, which pays a fixed rate of interest 
(``Fixed Account''). As of September 30, 2016, there were a total of 
125 individual Contract owners, only 47 of whom were invested in the 
Separate Account. Contract owners may transfer account assets between 
the Fixed Account and the Separate Account but only once every 12 
months.
    4. Redemptions have significantly reduced the Separate Account's 
assets over the past decade and are likely to continue notwithstanding 
any positive investment performance that may result in a net increase 
in the Separate Account's assets. As of September 30, 2016, the 
Separate Account had approximately $800,000 in total net assets.
    5. The public offering of the Contracts under the Securities Act of 
1933 (``Securities Act'') was initially registered in 1967 (File No. 2-
27135). The Company discontinued the sale of new Contracts in 1984. 
Although the Contracts allow Contract owners to make additional 
contributions, the Company has not received an additional contribution 
under the Contracts since November 2006, which was allocated to the 
Fixed Account. No contributions or transfers have been allocated to the 
Separate Account since 2002. The Company has no intention of offering 
the Contracts to new purchasers, and conducts no solicitation or 
marketing activities with respect to the Contracts.

II. Applicants' Legal Analysis

    1. Applicants respectfully request that the Commission, pursuant to 
Section 6(c) of the Act, issue an Order granting an exemption from all 
provisions of the Act, subject to the conditions set out in Section 
III, below. Applicants believe, based on the grounds set out in the 
application, that the requested exemption meets the standards of 
Section 6(c) of the Act.
    2. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to 
``conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or 
transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or 
transactions, from the provisions of [the Act] or of any rule or 
regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such exemption is 
necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the 
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy 
and provisions of [the Act.]''
    3. Applicants believe that the requested exemption is appropriate 
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors 
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 
Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the Act makes clear that Congress intended to 
exclude from the Act entities in which there is no significant public 
interest.\1\ As noted above, only 47 individual beneficial owners are 
currently invested in the Separate Account, well below the 100 person 
limit of Section 3(c)(1). In addition, the Company discontinued the 
sale of new Contracts in 1984. Likewise, the Separate Account has not 
received any additional Contract owner money in over a decade. No 
salesperson is engaged in any solicitation or marketing activity with 
respect to the Contracts or the Separate Account, and no compensation 
is being paid for any such activity. The Company has no intention of 
offering the Contracts to new purchasers, or encouraging any 
investments in the Separate Account and will not do so if the Order is 
granted. Although the terms and conditions of the Contracts permit 
Contract owners to make future allocations to or investments in the 
Separate Account, Applicants assert that the Separate Account's 
historical experience strongly suggests that the likelihood of 
receiving any such allocation or investment is remote.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ H.R. Rep. No. 96-1341 at 35 (1980); S. Rep. No. 96-958 at 20 
(1980). (``Section 3(c)(1) was intended to exclude from the Act 
private companies in which there is no significant public interest 
and which are therefore not appropriate subjects of federal 
regulation.'')
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    4. In addition, Applicants state that Contract owners do not need 
the protections afforded by the Act. Applicants assert that Contract 
owners are adequately protected by the fact that their longstanding 
relationship with the Company of over 30 years is established by the 
terms and conditions of the Contracts, which may not be changed without 
Contract owner approval except where permitted or required by 
applicable law. The Contracts, among other things, fix the fees and 
charges (including management fees) associated with the Separate 
Account, thus distinguishing the Separate Account from mutual funds 
whose expenses can change periodically. The Contracts also confer upon 
owners the right to receive at least annually a statement (a) 
reflecting the investment results for the prior year, (b) listing the 
investments of the Separate Account as of the date of the statement, 
and (c) reflecting the value of the accumulation units credited to the 
Contracts. Moreover, after the date of the Order requested by the 
application, Applicants will provide Contract owners with annual 
audited financial statements of the Company and the Separate Account 
pursuant to proposed condition 5 described below. In addition, the 
Contracts are governed by and administered according to state

[[Page 9085]]

insurance law, which requires that the Company maintain in the Separate 
Account assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other 
contract liabilities with respect to the Separate Account; that the 
income, gains and losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated 
to the Separate Account be credited to or charged against the Separate 
Account, without regard to other income, gains or losses of the 
Company; and that assets of the Separate Account equal to the reserves 
and other contract liabilities with respect to the Separate Account not 
be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business the 
Company may conduct. Furthermore, the requested relief would be subject 
to the other conditions described in Section III, below.
    5. Applicants state that there is very little Contract owner 
interest in the Separate Account. The last time a premium was received 
under a Contract was in November 2006, and the last time a premium or 
transfer was allocated to the Separate Account was in 2002. The 
Separate Account's assets have been declining due to redemptions over 
the past decade and are likely to continue to decline as the result of 
redemptions.
    6. Applicants maintain that granting the requested relief would 
enable Applicants to avoid the difficulties of trying to efficiently 
manage the Separate Account in compliance with the diversification and 
other requirements of the Act as assets dwindle down to zero. Further, 
Applicants assert that granting the requested relief would enable 
Applicants to avoid the significant ongoing legal, accounting, and 
other costs of maintaining a registered investment company, which costs 
currently exceed the amount of revenues generated by the fees under the 
Contracts.
    7. Applicants submit that the relief is consistent with the 
protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy 
and provisions of the 1940 Act.

III. Conditions

    Applicants consent to the following conditions to any Order issued 
by the Commission:
    1. The Company will continue to be responsible for satisfying all 
the obligations to Contract owners as specified under the terms of 
their Contracts. In addition, promptly after the issuance of the Notice 
of the application, the Company will deliver a written document to all 
Contract owners that will state that the Notice has been issued; that, 
consequently, after the order granting the relief requested in the 
Notice is issued, certain legal protections afforded to Contract owners 
allocating assets to an investment company registered under the Act no 
longer apply to them; that, nevertheless, the terms and conditions of 
such Contracts have not changed; and that the Company continues to be 
responsible for satisfying all the obligations to such Contract owners 
as specified under the terms of their Contracts. In the event a 
Contract owner transfers money from the Fixed Account to the Separate 
Account, the Company and the Separate Account will notify such 
transferring Contract owner that the Separate Account is no longer a 
Separate Account registered under the Act and provide the Contract 
owner a one-time opportunity to transfer the money back into the Fixed 
Account prior to the 12 month holding period required by the Contracts. 
Any subsequent transfer by the same Contract owner from the Fixed 
Account to the Separate Account will be subject to the 12 month holding 
period required by the Contracts.
    2. The Company will continue to be responsible for maintaining 
records of the values under each owner's Contract, providing quarterly 
statements and transaction confirmations to Contract owners, and all 
other administrative functions in connection with the Separate Account. 
As in the past, the Company may retain one or more administrators to 
provide such services, but the Company will remain ultimately 
responsible therefor.
    3. The Separate Account will at all times continue to be operated 
in the manner contemplated by Rule 0-1(e)(1) and (2) under the Act. 
Specifically:
    (a) The Separate Account will continue to be an account established 
and maintained by an insurance company pursuant to the laws of a state 
or territory of the United States under which income, gains and losses, 
whether or not realized, from assets allocated to the Separate Account 
are, in accordance with the Contracts, credited to or charged against 
the Separate Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of 
the insurance company,
    (b) the Separate Account shall be legally segregated and the assets 
of the Separate Account will, at the time during the year that 
adjustments in the reserves are made, have a value at least equal to 
the Company's reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to 
the Separate Account, and, at all other times, will have a value 
approximately equal to or in excess of such reserves and liabilities, 
and
    (c) that portion of the Separate Account's assets having a value 
equal to such reserves and contract liabilities will not be chargeable 
with liabilities arising out of any other business that the Company may 
conduct.
    4. The Company and the Separate Account will operate in compliance 
with applicable state insurance law, including but not limited to 
filing annual audited financial statements of the Company and the 
Separate Account with the insurance department of the Company's 
domiciliary state.
    5. The Company will provide Contract owners invested in the 
Separate Account with copies of the annual audited financial statements 
of the Company and the Separate Account.
    6. The Company and the Separate Account will not solicit additional 
contributions from Contract owners, or resume the sale of Contracts, 
and will not use the Separate Account to issue any other annuity 
contracts that would require the Separate Account to be registered 
under the Act unless so registered. In addition, the Company and the 
Separate Account will not solicit transfers from the Fixed Account into 
the Separate Account. Furthermore, the Separate Account will not be 
used for any other business other than as a funding vehicle for the 
Contracts.
    7. The Separate Account will re-register under the Act should the 
number of beneficial owners invested in the Separate Account exceed 
100.
    8. The Separate Account will continue to create, maintain and keep 
current the books and records as set forth in Rules 31a-1 and 31a-2 
under the Act for the periods specified by these Rules.

IV. Conclusion

    For the reasons and upon the facts set forth above and in the 
application, Applicants submit that their exemptive request meets the 
standards set out in Section 6(c) of the Act and that the Commission, 
therefore, should grant the requested Order.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
pursuant to delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

Richard’s father’s quiet leadership in the armed forces gave him the drive he has today to become a successful Allstate agent who is committed to serving others. Richard’s dedication and volunteer efforts for local charities and devotion to family reflect qualities of a trusted Allstate advisor. Taught by his father’s example, Richard learned the importance of protecting family and the pleasure of helping people insure what is most precious.  Richard actively supports the following charitable causes:
- High View Baptist Church
- Rotary Club
- School sports teams and cheerleading squads
- Supporting the under-privileged
Additionally, Richard has over 11 years of financial services experience.  His goal is to continue his agency’s exceptional customer service while preparing families for today’s risks and tomorrow’s unexpected catastrophes.

The right amount of life insurance could keep the equivalent of your paycheck coming in to help the family get back on their feet.Get started×CancelConfirmProtect What Matters MostWhether it's your home, your family, your bike or your boat, see how Allstate can help protect the things that matter most to you in life.What Is Hazard Insurance?Your house is not just your home; it's likely also one of the most valuable things you own. While you have homeowners insurance to help protect you and that investment, what exactly does it cover? Homeowners policies usually help provide coverage from damage from certain hazards (or perils), such as fire, hail or vandalism. This overview of homeowners insurance is a great place to start, but it's also a good idea to you review your policy so you know your specific coverage.Learn More What Is Comprehensive Auto Insurance?When you hear the word "comprehensive," you might think "all-encompassing." But when it comes to insurance, the word has a different meaning. Simply put, comprehensive coverage helps protect you against damage to your car that is not the result of a collision - such as theft or a fallen tree branch. I'd be happy to talk to you about whether comprehensive coverage makes sense for you.Learn More Do I Need Renters Insurance in College?If you're heading off to college, you may be thinking about football games and all night study sessions. You probably aren't imagining someone taking your smartphone or your roommate's failed attempt at dinner and the resulting kitchen fire. But those are, unfortunately, possibilities whether you live on campus or are renting an apartment. Since you may be bringing some expensive items with you, like a laptop and television, consider this overview on protecting your belongings while you're away from home.Learn More Term Life Insurance 101Term life insurance can be an affordable way to help protect your loved ones for a set amount of time - typically anywhere from one to 30 years. You'll be covered for the length of the selected term, and your beneficiaries will receive the policy benefit if you should pass away during that time. If you're interested in term insurance, this brief overview is a great place to start. I know that buying life insurance can be a difficult decision, but it is an important one. That's why I’m here to help you choose the best options for you.Learn More Tips for Managing Small Business Insurance CostsBeing a small business owner can mean working long after you've "closed" for the day. The to-do list is never done, and you're frequently juggling priorities. But you may want to move reviewing your business insurance to the top of that list. There's a lot to consider when covering the business you put your heart into. From making sure you having the right amount of protection to managing risks and bundling coverages, I'm here to help you choose the coverage that is right for your business.Learn More Is a Wedding Covered by Event Insurance?Considerable investments of time and money can go into planning a wedding. Two types of event insurance may be available to help protect that investment.Learn More Comparing Motorcycle Insurance QuotesWhether you're about to buy your first bike or you've been riding for years, you know there's nothing quite like being out on a motorcycle. From weekend tours to a fun way to commute, it's an important part of your life — one you know you need to help protect with motorcycle insurance. Before you start shopping for motorcycle coverage, here are a few steps to follow that may help you choose the policy that best fits your needs.Learn More Do I Need ATV Insurance?The coverages that come with an all-terrain vehicle policy may help protect you and your ATV in key ways. Most policies include coverage for the ATV that may help pay for repairs after a crash or other unexpected event, like theft or fire. In addition, liability protection may help prevent you from paying out of pocket if you accidentally injure someone else or damage their property. In some cases, you may even be legally required to carry ATV insurance. Give me a call for more information about what types of protections ATV insurance may provide and what may be required in our neck of the woods.Learn More Condo InsuranceYou found the perfect condominium, called about the utilities and have movers lined up. But before you move in, do you have the right coverage for your new home? Condos are unique in the way they are insured - both you and the condo association need policies. From common areas to personal property, it's important that you understand what your policy covers and what your condo association's insurance may help protect. Take a look at this overview of condominium insurance, and then let's make sure you have the coverage you need.Learn More Have Policy Questions? I Can Help!Whether you're moving, test driving a car or considering buying life insurance, an agent's expertise may come in handy. Certain life events and policy questions are best addressed with an insurance agent consultation.Learn More What's Umbrella Insurance?You have insurance to help protect your home and car, but what happens in situations where your standard insurance coverage is not enough? That's when a personal umbrella insurance policy (PUP) could help. If you're found legally responsible for damages resulting from an accident or if you're sued, a PUP may help prevent you from paying out of pocket for costs that exceed the limits of your homeowners or auto insurance. A PUP from Allstate may help cover attorney costs and lost wages, even if you're out of the country. If you're interested in increasing your protection, I'd be happy to talk to you about umbrella coverage today.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Colorado Springs.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceAnnuitiesRetirementCollege Savings PlanContactPhone(719) 574-9922(719) 574-9922Email:rkiedinger@allstate.comrkiedinger@allstate.comAddress:7615 Astn Blfs Pkwy, Unit 200Colorado Springs, CO 80920Get DirectionsLandmarks:Woodmen Rd and Austin BluffsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Colorado Springs, Monument, Black Forest, Peyton, Falcon, Calhan, Elbert.

3. Certain variable annuity contracts sponsored by Allstate and issued through Allstate Separate Account I (“Allstate contracts”) are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”). 
4. Allstate Separate Account I is divided into 59 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the Act (the “Funds”). 
5. Northbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998. Previously, from 1978 to 1998, Northbrook was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois. Northbrook's headquarters are located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Northbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate. Northbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York. Northbrook and Allstate entered into a reinsurance agreement effective December 31, 1987. Under the reinsurance agreement, Allstate reinsures all of Northbrook's liabilities under its annuity and life insurance contracts. 
6. Northbrook established the Northbrook Separate Accounts as separate accounts pursuant to Illinois law, and the Northbrook Separate Accounts are currently subject to Arizona law following Northbrook's redomestication to Arizona in 1998. Each of the Northbrook Separate Accounts is a “separate account,” as defined by Section 2(a)(37) of the Act, and is registered with the Commission pursuant to the Act as a unit investment trust. 
7. Certain variable annuity contracts sponsored by Northbrook and issued through the Northbrook Separate Accounts (the “Northbrook contracts,” and together with the “Allstate contracts,” the “Contracts”) are registered with the Commission pursuant to the Securities Act. 
8. Northbrook VA is divided into 12 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. Northbrook VA II is divided into 54 sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Funds. 
9. Allstate and Northbrook have determined to engage in transactions whereby Northbrook will be reorganized with and merged into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation (such transactions, collectively, the “Merger”). By resolutions dated September 11, 2002, a Merger Agreement and Articles of Merger (collectively “Agreement”) were approved and adopted by the respective boards of directors of Allstate and Northbrook. Prior approval of the Merger and the Agreement also will be obtained from the insurance departments of Arizona and Illinois, the states of domicile for Northbrook and Allstate, respectively. 
10. On the effective date of the Merger: (a) Allstate will assume ownership of all the assets of Northbrook, including all the assets held in the Northbrook Separate Accounts; (b) Allstate will conduct the business presently conducted by Northbrook, and will be responsible for satisfaction of all of the liabilities and obligations of Northbrook; and (c) Northbrook will cease to exist as a separate corporate entity. Allstate will then control the merged separate account supporting the Contracts. 
11. After considering the nature and purpose of each separate account, the respective boards of directors of Allstate and Northbrook have determined that the efficiency of the operations of the separate accounts after the Merger could be improved, and the overall administration enhanced, by merging Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II into Allstate Separate Account I (collectively, “Separate Accounts”). The Merger will be structured so there will be no change in the rights and benefits of persons having an interest in any of the Contracts issued by the Separate Accounts. Allstate, or an affiliate, will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the Merger. The Merger provides for the transfer of Northbrook VA's and Northbrook VA II's assets to Allstate Separate Account I and the assumption of the liabilities and contractual obligations of each of Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II by Allstate Separate Account I in return for the crediting of accumulation units of Allstate Separate Account I to Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II contract owners. Once this process has been completed, the units of Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II would be cancelled, Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II would each submit an application to the Commission pursuant to Section 8(f) of the Act to effect its deregistration as an investment company and would cease to exist, and Allstate Separate Account I would continue to exist. 
12. Immediately following the Merger, each Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II contract owner will possess a number of Allstate Separate Account I units, (both full and fractional) with an aggregate unit value equal to the aggregate unit value of the units the contract owner had in the respective Northbrook Separate Account immediately before the consummation of the Merger. 
13. Upon the effective date of the Merger, Allstate will succeed to all of the business and operations of Northbrook, including the obligations pursuant to the Northbrook contracts. Allstate will distribute to each existing Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II contract owner: 
(a) A contract rider indicating that such contracts are thereafter funded by Allstate Separate Account I; (b) a letter informing such contract owners of the Merger; and (c) prospectus disclosure that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of Start Printed Page 72239the surviving separate account as a result of the Merger. 
14. Except for the change in the depositor and the separate account funding the variable annuity contracts, all the rights and benefits of the Northbrook contract owners will remain unchanged after the Merger. Further, the fees and charges under the Northbrook contracts will not change as a result of the Merger. 
15. Allstate and Northbrook assert that the Merger will have no tax consequences for Northbrook contract owners. In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Northbrook contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed. 
Applicants' Legal Analysis 
1. Section 17(a) of the Act provides generally that it is unlawful for any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, acting as principal to knowingly purchase or to sell any security or other property from or to such registered company. 
2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides generally that the Commission may grant an order exempting a transaction otherwise prohibited by Section 17(a) of the Act if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned; and (c) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 
3. The Merger may be subject to the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act because it could be viewed as involving an investment company (Northbrook VA or Northbrook VA II) selling its assets to another investment company (Allstate Separate Account I) that is affiliated by reason of having sponsoring insurance companies that are under common control, or by reason of having common directors. 
4. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 17(b) of the Act to the extent necessary to exempt the Merger from the provisions of Section 17(a) of the Act. 
5. Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger are fair and reasonable. The transfer of assets held by Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II, respectively, will be made at the relative net asset values of the sub-accounts. Consequently, the interests of Allstate Separate Account I owners will not be diluted by the Merger, and each Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II contract will be credited, immediately after the Merger, with units of Allstate Separate Account I having the same aggregate value as the aggregate value of the units of Northbrook VA and Northbrook VA II credited to such contract immediately prior to the Merger. The Merger will not result in any change in charges, costs, fees or expenses borne by any Contract owner. No direct or indirect costs will be incurred by any Separate Account concerned as a result of the Merger. Therefore, the proposed transactions will not result in dilution of the economic interests of any Contract owners. In addition, the Merger will result in no change in the investment options available to Northbrook contract owners. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. 
6. Applicants assert that the Merger does not involve overreaching on the part of any party involved and is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. The purpose of the Merger is to consolidate three separate accounts, each of which issues variable annuity contracts, into a single separate account. The Merger will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings by Allstate because it can consolidate its separate account operations. The Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Northbrook contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Northbrook contracts. The Merger will not affect any current Allstate contract owners. Allstate, or an affiliate, will pay all expenses incurred in connection with the Merger. 
7. Applicants represent that the Merger is consistent with the policy of each Separate Account as set forth in its registration statement. The policy of each Separate Account is to invest in the Funds. As noted above, the Merger will result in no change to any Fund underlying the Northbrook Separate Accounts. Each sub-account of the Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. Accordingly, the assets underlying the Contracts will continue to be invested in accordance with the policies recited in the Separate Accounts' respective registration statements. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons summarized above, Applicants assert that the terms of the Merger, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, are consistent with the policies of Allstate Separate Account I and the Northbrook Separate Accounts as recited in their registration statements, are consistent with the general purposes of the Act, and therefore meet the conditions for exemptive relief established by Section 17(b). 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Environmental record[edit]
Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The Allstate Corporation is the second largest personal lines insurer in the United States (behind State Farm) and the largest that is publicly held. The company also has personal lines insurance operations in Canada. Allstate was founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., and was spun off in 1993.[4] The company has had its headquarters in Northfield Township, Illinois, near Northbrook since 1967.[5][6] Its current advertising campaign, in use since 2004, asks, "Are you in good hands?" The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".
