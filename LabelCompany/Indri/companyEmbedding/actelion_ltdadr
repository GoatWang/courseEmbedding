Johnson & Johnson raises full-year guidance
Johnson & Johnson raised its top- and bottom-line outlook for the year even as the health-care giant's second-quarter revenue declined amid steeper competition for some of its key drugs. Shares in the company were trading up 1.1% premarket to $133.60. Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said investments will accelerate sales growth in the second half of the year, highlighting the company's $30 billion acquisition of Actelion Ltd., which closed in the quarter.

Actelion Pharmaceuticals - R&D Investment And Returns - Actelion Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:ALIOY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Actelion Pharmaceuticals - R&D Investment And ReturnsJul. 2.15 | About: Actelion Ltd. (ALIOY) Saurabh Mishra Value, research analyst, biotech, healthcareFarmantraSummaryThe accounting treatment of R&D expenses skews the actual return on capital of the company.The return on capital of Actelion drops to almost half when R&D is capitalized.Given the poor R&D efficiency of pharmaceuticals these days, the return on capital drops for most of the companies.The companies who manage R&D efficiently will have higher return on capital when capitalized.It is true that accounting is inconsistent in dealing with capital expenditures and operating expenditures of manufacturing firms vs. technology or R&D based firms. The operating expenditures are designed to generate benefits in the current year whereas capital expenditures are designed to generate benefits in the future. The US GAAP does not allow the R&D to be capitalized whereas in IFRS, a certain portion of development cost can be capitalized provided there is a certainty in future benefits.
Hence, we decided to take Actelion Pharmaceuticals (OTCPK:ALIOY) (OTCPK:ALIOF) as an example to understand the impact on its return on capital when it capitalizes its R&D vs. when it does not. The idea of this exercise is that as a risk averse investor, one would prefer investing in a company with better R&D productivity i.e. better return on capital on its R&D investment.
Actelion Pharmaceuticals
Actelion Ltd. is a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative drugs for diseases with unmet medical needs. Actelion is a leader in the field of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Their portfolio of PAH treatments covers the spectrum of disease, from WHO Functional Class (FC) II through to FC IV, with oral, inhaled and intravenous medications. Although not available in all countries, Actelion has treatments approved by health authorities for a number of specialist diseases including Type 1 Gaucher disease, Niemann-Pick type C disease, Digital Ulcers in patients suffering from systemic sclerosis, and mycosis fungoides type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Actelion's stock price movements
Actelion's stock price jumped from 41 CHF in July 2010 to 138.5 today 1st of July 2015. Comparing with the S&P 500 and Morningstar midcap companies, Actelion seems to be ahead in the game.

Source: Morningstar
The R&D Investment and returns
Before we capitalize Actelion's R&D investment, let us first understand the reasons why accounting does not permit capitalizing R&D:


Benefits are uncertain: It is true that R&D is uncertain but so is an investment in a manufacturing plant in countries torn with civil war. Even some of the giant companies such as HP (NYSE:HPQ) have tried to build tablets, which were unsuccessful in the market, but those expenses of manufacturing were capitalized. Accounting was developed way back when manufacturing was one of the key businesses. Since then, the business models have changed - we have businesses such as Uber, Airbnb, consumer product companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Biotech companies that might not own a big chunk of tangible assets but in order to generate long-term returns, they do lot of investments in R&D, training and advertisements. Hence, those expenses (or a portion of those expenses) that would generate returns in long term need to be capitalized

Being Conservative: One of the arguments is that by expensing the R&D, the earnings are conservative. However, by expensing, we are depriving the biggest asset from the books of Biotech companies i.e. their R&D. That also implies that the return on capital for those companies spending huge amounts on Intangible assets will look inflated.

Impact of R&D Investments on Return on Capital
Actelion spent 437 M CHF on R&D in 2014.
In order to capitalize, it is important to first define the amortizable life of R&D i.e. how much time it takes Actelion to launch the product from its R&D lab to the market. Given the strategy to develop its own products as well as in-license at very late stages, an average of five years was assumed (contrary to typical product development time of 10 years). After collecting the five-year R&D expenses from 2009-2013, the unamortized R&D over the period was sum up. The unamortized R&D is the value of the research asset and will be added separately during the calculation of book value of capital.

The Value of the research asset/unamortized value of the R&D = 1317 M CHF
Total amortization of R&D asset for 2014 = 454.2 M CHF
The R&D expenditure for 2014 i.e. 437 M CHF is not amortized assuming that it is invested just yesterday.

(All the earnings in CHF millions)
The return on capital without capitalizing (24%) looks very attractive in comparison to 14% after capitalizing. This is because the book value of capital of 1556 M CHF does not include the value of the Intangible asset i.e. R&D investment done in the past.
Competitive analysis
In order to understand how Actelion's competition fare in terms of their R&D investments and returns, we decided to check the return on capital (ROC) of the competition: United Therapeutics (NASDAQ:UTHR), Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). If the ROC increases after capitalization, that's a rough indicator that the investment on R&D generates greater return than the investment on traditional assets.
The following table gives the ROC (expensing as well as capitalizing) of the competition:

It seems that capitalizing R&D has the maximum impact on Actelion. Although the profitability ratio seems very high but capitalizing pulls down the actual ROC. Capitalizing R&D provides an answer to the question: Is R&D investment good for the company? Of course, it is, provided it helps you to make excess returns in the future. Actelion does make excess returns i.e. its return on capital is higher than the cost of capital; however, our view about how much excess returns it has actually made is different when we capitalize the R&D investments i.e. investments that are meant to generate returns in the multiple periods.

Consequences for Valuation
When we capitalize the R&D, we are changing several financial statements. We evaluate its impact on the following parameters important for Valuation:


Operating Income: The operating income changes by adding back the R&D expense and subtracting the amortization of R&D.

Free cash flow to the firm (FCFF): It remains the same as earnings and reinvestment change by the same amount.

Growth rate: The fundamental expected growth rate depends on how much the company reinvests (in the form of capital expenditures and change in non-cash working capital) and how well it reinvests which is measured by the return on capital. If the operating income as well as the reinvestment increases, the reinvestment rate would increase. If the ROC is greater after capitalizing R&D, it can be assumed that returns on R&D investment is greater than the returns on traditional investments. Hence, the growth rate will increase or decrease depending on whether reinvestment rate and the return on capital increases/decreases.

Does Actelion's Intrinsic value decrease or increase after capitalization? We will see its impact in detail in our next post on Actelion.
In sum, we see that the accounting treatment of CAPEX at the manufacturing firm is different from that of technology based firms such as Biotech and pharmaceutical companies who invest a huge sum of money on R&D to generate returns in the future. Expensing R&D provides a skewed view of the returns they are making on their investments and also has an impact on the value. The companies who manage R&D efficiently will have higher return on capital when capitalized.
Assumptions:
Return on Capital: The book value of capital used is based on 2013 while the after tax operating income is from 2014. The argument is that in the real world there is always a lag between the capital invested and the returns the company generates.
Tax rate: Actelion received tax benefits in the year 2014. However, we used the marginal tax rate of 17.9% (KPMG data) for Switzerland with the assumption that it cannot earn the benefit throughout its life. For others, effective tax rates are used.

CAPEX: Includes PPE, cost of acquisition and R&D.
R&D amortization period: For Actelion, a five-year period is chosen as the company not only develops its own products at early stages but also licenses it at a very late stage to launch the products. Hence, on an average, we used a five-year period for the amortization

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Look Out Below - Tax Issues Could Catch ALIOY Holders By Surprise - Actelion Ltd. ADR (OTCMKTS:ALIOY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Look Out Below - Tax Issues Could Catch ALIOY Holders By SurpriseJun.23.17 | About: Actelion Ltd. (ALIOY) Christopher Fisher Special situations, event-driven, arbitrageSummaryJnJ has completed the acquisition of Actelion.An un-sponsored Actelion ADR trades OTC in the US.ADR shares could be subject to a 35% withholding tax with little recourse.On Friday, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) completed their acquisition of Swiss pharmaceutical company Actelion in a $30B deal (Actelion shareholders received USD$280/share + a share in a new R&D company called Idorsia). J&J paid in USD for a few reasons. For one, as Bloomberg estimated, over half of the shareholders were actually US based. Actelion traded on a few different exchanges with most volume being traded on the Swiss SIX exchange. For anyone planning to buy the shares as a merger arb trade, this complicated things, as you would have to pay for the shares in Swiss Francs (CHF) and then hedge the currency exposure. One alternative to this would have been to purchase the US listed ADR which trades OTC as OTCPK:ALIOY. This is an unsponsored ADR meaning it isn't associated with Actelion. Citi DRS (NYSE:C), the ADR sponsor, simply purchased shares of Actelion is Switzerland and listed the ADR shares in the US. Of note is that ALIOY represents ¼ share of Actelion so the payment price from J&J was US $70. This was an excellent trade suggested by one Seeking Alpha author here. A situation that has been common in a few recent foreign mergers is that there are tax uncertainties depending on the proportion of shares tendered and whether a holder has tendered their shares. Actelion made it easy to avoid issues of the shares trading past the tender deadline by listing a tendered line of shares under the ticker ATLNEE. Traders could buy this line right up until Friday's close and not worry about having missed the tender deadline. The issue with not tendering is that if between 90-98% of shares are tendered, holders of shares that aren't tendered, MAY be subject to Swiss withholding tax to the tune of 35%. From the offer document:  "The consideration paid to remaining Actelion minority shareholders (irrespective of their tax residence) in the squeeze-out merger may, depending on the structuring of the squeeze-out merger, be subject to Swiss withholding tax of 35% on the difference between (NYSE:I) the amount of the consideration and (ii) the sum of the nominal value of the Actelion Shares concerned and of the proportionate part of Actelion's reserves from capital contributions (Reserven aus Kapitaleinlagen) attributable to the respective Actelion Shares"... "Actelion shareholders who are not tax residents of Switzerland may be entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss withholding tax if the country of residence for tax purposes has entered into a bilateral treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Switzerland and the conditions of such treaty are met." 
 By my calculations, the book value per share is roughly CHF12/share, meaning withholding tax could be applied on the remaining CHF 268 being paid to Actelion shareholders. At 35%, that would be about CHF94/share in withholding tax, or net proceeds of $46.58/share of ALIOY. There was a similar situation with ChemChina's tender offer for Syngenta (NYSE:SYT), which was also domiciled in Switzerland. There is an excellent write up on the tax issues associated with the Syngenta closing here (comment section has some good info as well). Let me outline the key points:  Syngenta, based in Switzerland, trades as SYNN in Switzerland and also as a sponsored (i.e. issued by the company) ADR in the US as (5 SYT shares represent 1 SYNN share). US options are available on this ticker. Merger consideration paid by ChemChina was USD$93 per share or USD$265 per (SYNN) share. Faces possible 35% withholding tax if percentage of shares tendered is less than 98% - applicable to foreign holders who did not tender. US holders may be able to have this tax reduced to 15%. SYT was a company issued ADR, therefore Swiss holders could step in and purchase untendered shares and not be subject to the withholding tax. There was a certain amount of uncertainty with how options could be treated. It was possible that the OCC could step in and 'mark' the options, suspend trading, and cash settle all outstanding options. If shares traded down substantially to reflect the possible withholding tax, put sellers could have been in for a nasty surprise.  What happened? On May 25th, Syngenta announced provisional tender results indicating 92.2% of shares had been tendered. When it appeared that there would be no extension of the tender offer and shares remaining untendered could be subject to withholding tax, shares began trading down, closing at $88.05 on May 30th from the closing price of $92.72 may 25th. Put option prices started increasing dramatically with most trades occurring on the bid. ChemChina and Syngenta put an end to speculation however with a press release on May 31st, stating that they had acquired close to 95% of Syngenta shares and would continue buying shares in the market with the aim of reaching the 98% threshold. While shares remain listed and trading, and it's possible they could still be hit with withholding tax, it now seems likely ChemChina will simply continue buying shares until they hit 98%.
 

 SYT data by YCharts So now back to Actelion and its unsponsored ADR. The issue of withholding tax was of obvious concern for ALIOY shareholders, who made clear the risks to the ADR's issuer Citi. For whatever reason, Citi decided not to tender the shares (which I confirmed with a Citi representative). Because of the share structure, there is also no way for Swiss parties to buy shares and avoid withholding tax. Actelion's last announcement on the tender stated the definitive end to the tender, with 92.5% of shares being submitted. They later announced the completion of the acquisition after clearing by the EU Commission with settlement on June 16th. Actelion stated that immediately after the completion of the tender offer, they would file to de-list shares from the Swiss SIX exchange and J&J would conduct a squeeze out of remaining shares thereafter (ATLN shares are still trading). 

 ALIOY data by YCharts So if you are holding shares of ALIOY, should you sell now? Citi confirmed they planned to sell the Idorsia shares they received in the market, which could mean proceeds of between USD$ 2.40-$3.65, depending on when they sold. Shares could be paid out between USD $72.40 and $73.65 (vs. the current price of $72.50) if no withholding tax is applied. If withholding tax is applied consideration paid to holders could be closer to $50. There also seems to be little holders of ALIOY could do to reclaim these taxes given the ADR structure.
 So should you sell now? I certainly wouldn't want to hold these shares given the uncertainty.
