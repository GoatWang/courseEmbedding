Dominic Casserley on The Changing Risk Landscape

by Willis Towers Watson,  September 3, 2015 


Managing risk is an increasingly challenging task in a world susceptible both to old hazards, such as extreme weather, and to emerging threats, like cyberattacks. In this interview, the CEO of risk advisor and insurance broker Willis Group, Dominic Casserley, discusses opportunities to mitigate emerging risks, build more resilient companies, and digitize the insurance process. This interview was conducted by McKinsey’s Rik Kirkland, and an extended and edited transcript of Casserley’s remarks follows.
The Risk Landscape
We see a number of trends that really underpin growth for us. One is that in many parts of the world, businesses are fundamentally underinsured. And that’s what we’re really involved in: risk advisory and insurance brokerage for businesses. If you take the United States, where insurance premiums in the space we’re talking about are about 4.2 percent of GDP, and in China they’re just over 1 percent, that’s indicative of the fact that there is a long way to go. There’s a long way to go not only in building up more resilient companies, which have more insurance, but, actually, in the middle of that, conducting advisory and brokerage activities to help them navigate a complex world.
That’s one growth opportunity for us. A second is in the world of healthcare. We provide a lot of advice and support to companies in building their healthcare programs. Our role in advising companies is very important, as their populations have higher and higher healthcare aspirations. The third growth opportunity for us, on a macrolevel, is emerging new risks. The one everyone reads about, of course, is cyber. It’s an area that ten years ago hardly anyone talked about, but it is now a major issue for companies, countries, cities to think through. And thinking through loss-prevention and resilience to loss from cyberattacks and cyber issues and data-management issues is a major topic.
Developing New Products
When you’re thinking about developing new products in new risk areas, you’re obviously struggling with data. I’ll give you two examples. In the cyber area, the risk is still evolving, and the best ways of managing that risk are evolving. I would say that is very early; this is a very young event.
Another new risk area, one that is getting much more focus, is the impact of extreme weather, climate change. And there actually is data. Some of it’s controversial, but there is data. So you can start to model the sorts of risks that people could be facing, particularly if they have a diversified portfolio. For example, for someone on the East Coast of the United States, there is a lot of modeling of the types of risks they may face, which does enable you to start to develop products and ways of risk mitigation that companies can adopt. But underpinning all of this is, how stable is the risk? And is there data?
Innovating Across the Business
There is some evidence that the whole insurance chain in B2B insurance could be starting to enter the disintermediation process that we saw in banking, where in the ’70s, ’80s, ’90s, and early 2000s we saw a decline in the relative amount of volume that was going through the traditional banking markets, because direct capital-market disintermediation of that process increased. There’s some evidence that we may be in the early stages of that happening in the insurance field, in the B2B-insurance field. That would be of great interest to us, and we’re looking at that very, very carefully.
The second element of innovation is, obviously, responding to new risks. We’re working very hard to help businesses figure out how they should think about cyberrisk. We’re spending a lot of time investing in the weather outlook and what implications that has for our clients, and developing new products, new capabilities for companies, countries, and cities to think about resilience.
A third area of innovation for us, relating to our own business, is digitization. It’s crucial to us for two reasons. One, it’s about providing better products through data management. Our industry is full of data; it isn’t full of a lot of information. So how do we turn that data into usable information that can produce better products for our clients? It’s also about reducing our costs and reducing the costs of the whole business system—not just Willis’s role in it, but actually the whole flow.
Thinking about digitization and how it affects our business—I’ll start at the client side, because there’s so much potential data about, frankly, the loss history of groups of clients. We now have a portfolio of 500 clients, who are broadly in the same category, and we can show you that such a diversified portfolio produces, over time, this sort of loss history. And we have the data to underpin that.
You then actually have a potential portfolio of risk that can be used and marketed to a much broader set of investors—insurance companies, but also potentially other investors. That creates potentially a better product and better pricing for our clients. When we think about digitization applied to us, there’s still a lot of paper in this industry. A lot. And that’s expensive. So all the things we’ve seen in the trading markets, or straight-through processing, in theory should be applied in the insurance industry. Now, the insurance industry is more complicated. The fundamental issue is that the insurance contract has more variability to it and uniqueness to it than a bond. But it isn’t limitless, so there are opportunities to digitize that.
Focusing on the Future
We’re a people business, so the way we attract, train, retain, motivate, and compensate them are critical issues. Related to that, issue number two, is actually all the issues around the sense of purpose of the company. Why do we exist? Values and having that as a common bond, which enables us to be very mission driven and connected as an organization, is very important.
The third issue is the use of technology: digitization issues to serve our clients and also, frankly, to make us more effective and efficient—that’s critical. But there is a fourth issue, which is that, like it or not, as a CEO you do have to keep an eye on world dynamics. We’re a global company, and if you think you can operate independently of what’s going on in the world, it’s just not realistic. So you do have to make either long-term or short-term resource-allocation shifts based upon the realities of what’s going on in the world.

Dominic Casserley  



Private equity firm Warburg Pincus L.L.C. on Thursday said it has named former Willis Group Holdings P.L.C. CEO Dominic Casserley as a senior adviser in its financial services group.
Mr. Casserley, who took over the chief executive position at Willis Group Holdings in 2013, led the brokerage’s merger with Towers Watson & Co. to create Willis Towers Watson P.L.C. in January 2016. After the merger, he was named president and deputy CEO of the combined firm but left within a year.
Prior to that, Mr. Casserley spent 30 years at McKinsey & Co., where he held several senior leadership positions in New York, Hong Kong and London.
In his new role with New York-based Warburg Pincus, Mr. Casserley will help identify and evaluate new investment opportunities in the financial services sector, including in the banking and insurance industries, the company said in a statement.
“We are pleased to welcome Dominic as a senior adviser in our Financial Services Group," Michael Martin, Warburg Pincus’ managing director, said in the statement. “His extensive track record leading and advising companies in financial services, risk management and insurance will be valuable to the team as we identify new investments across our global network and support our portfolio company management teams.”

Dominic Casserley, Willis CEO Designate (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Oct 17, 2012 5:34 AM EDT













 




























































  The Board of Directors of Willis Group Holdings (NYSE: WSH), the global insurance broker, today announced that Dominic Casserley will serve as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer, effective January 7, 2013. The Board also announced that Steve Hearn, currently the Chairman and CEO of Willis Global, will serve as Deputy CEO of Willis Group. Joe Plumeri, who has served as Chairman and CEO of Willis Group since 2000 and led the company back to public ownership and steered its global expansion during his 12-year tenure, will serve as non-executive Chairman through July, 2013.   Dominic Casserley, Willis CEO Designate (Photo: Business Wire)   Dominic Casserley, 54, is currently a senior partner of McKinsey & Company, which he joined in New York in 1983. During his 29-years at McKinsey, Casserley has been based in the U.S. for 12 years, Asia for five and, since 2000, has been working across Europe from London. During his time at McKinsey, Casserley led the firm’s Greater China Practice and its UK and Ireland Practice. A noted expert on global financial services, including insurance companies, and the opportunities of expanding into new markets, Casserley has been a member of McKinsey’s Shareholder Council, the firm’s global board, since 1999 and for four years served as the Chairman of the Finance Committee of that board. Casserley, married with three children, is a graduate of Cambridge University. Following a transition period in 2013, Casserley will be based in Willis’ New York office.  “The Board of Directors, which has now concluded a rigorous and thorough search for our next CEO, is thrilled to welcome Dominic Casserley to Willis to inaugurate the next great era for our company. We think Dominic will be an extraordinary leader for Willis, just as Joe Plumeri has been,” said Sen. Bill Bradley, Managing Director of Allen & Co. LLC and Willis’ presiding independent director. “Willis is indebted to Joe for his passionate stewardship of our firm spanning more than a decade in which Willis delivered unrivaled shareholder value among our peers. We are also grateful that Steve Hearn, a great broking industry leader within our own ranks, will step up as Dominic’s partner and Deputy CEO to help bring Willis to the next level,” Bradley added.

History[edit]




The Willis Building in London


The company was founded by Henry Willis in London in 1828, and initially operated as Henry Willis & Co.[4] In 1898 it merged with Faber Brothers (founded in 1886) to form Willis Faber,[4] and then in 1928 it merged with Dumas & Wylie (founded in 1843) to create Willis, Faber & Dumas.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1976 as Willis Faber.[4]
It expanded into the United States in 1990 when it merged with Corroon & Black (founded as R. A. Corroon & Co. in 1905) to form the Willis Corroon Group.[4] In 1998 in a leveraged buyout the Company was acquired by Trinity Acquisition on behalf of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,[4] and in 1999 the name Willis Group was adopted.[4] It was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001.[4]
In October 2008, Willis acquired Hilb, Rogal & Hobbs Co. (HRH), one of the largest insurance and risk management intermediaries in North America and this has boosted their North American presence, as well as acquired Glencairn Limited which has augmented its Lloyd's of London Market strength.[5]

The Willis Building in Ipswich, England, is one of the earliest buildings designed by Norman Foster after establishing Foster Associates. Constructed between 1970 and 1975 it is now seen as a landmark in the development of the 'high tech' architectural style. It is one of the youngest buildings to be given Grade I listed building status in Britain.[13]
The 108-story Sears Tower in Chicago was renamed the Willis Tower in July 2009. Willis secured the naming rights as part of its agreement to lease 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2) of space in the 3,800,000-square-foot (350,000 m2) tower.[14] It was the world's tallest building from 1974 until 1998, when it was surpassed by the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[15]
Operations[edit]
Willis has 400 offices in more than 100 countries.[16]
Sponsorship[edit]
Willis Group is sponsor of The Willis Resilience Expedition, a scientific program in Antarctica to better understand our changing climate and build resilience to weather-related risk.[17]

History[edit]




The Willis Building in London


The company was founded by Henry Willis in London in 1828, and initially operated as Henry Willis & Co.[4] In 1898 it merged with Faber Brothers (founded in 1886) to form Willis Faber,[4] and then in 1928 it merged with Dumas & Wylie (founded in 1843) to create Willis, Faber & Dumas.[4] It was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1976 as Willis Faber.[4]
It expanded into the United States in 1990 when it merged with Corroon & Black (founded as R. A. Corroon & Co. in 1905) to form the Willis Corroon Group.[4] In 1998 in a leveraged buyout the Company was acquired by Trinity Acquisition on behalf of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts,[4] and in 1999 the name Willis Group was adopted.[4] It was first listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2001.[4]
In October 2008, Willis acquired Hilb, Rogal & Hobbs Co. (HRH), one of the largest insurance and risk management intermediaries in North America and this has boosted their North American presence, as well as acquired Glencairn Limited which has augmented its Lloyd's of London Market strength.[5]
Willis announced plans in 2009 to relocate its registered office from Bermuda to Ireland.[6] Its shareholders approved the move in December 2009, and the company announced on 31 December 2009, that its reorganisation has been completed and the new parent company of the Willis Group – known as Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company – is incorporated in Ireland.[7][8]
Merger[edit]
Main article: Willis Towers Watson
On June 30, 2015, Willis Group announced it would merge with Towers Watson to create Willis Towers Watson. The combined company operates in 120 countries, with a workforce of approximately 39,000 employees, revenues of $8.2 billion[9] and a value of $18 billion.[10] The merger was concluded on 5 January 2016 after all regulatory approvals were received.[11]
Buildings[edit]




The Willis Tower in Chicago


Willis moved into the Willis Building, its new London headquarters, in May 2008.[12]
The Willis Building in Ipswich, England, is one of the earliest buildings designed by Norman Foster after establishing Foster Associates. Constructed between 1970 and 1975 it is now seen as a landmark in the development of the 'high tech' architectural style. It is one of the youngest buildings to be given Grade I listed building status in Britain.[13]
The 108-story Sears Tower in Chicago was renamed the Willis Tower in July 2009. Willis secured the naming rights as part of its agreement to lease 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2) of space in the 3,800,000-square-foot (350,000 m2) tower.[14] It was the world's tallest building from 1974 until 1998, when it was surpassed by the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.[15]
Operations[edit]
Willis has 400 offices in more than 100 countries.[16]
Sponsorship[edit]
Willis Group is sponsor of The Willis Resilience Expedition, a scientific program in Antarctica to better understand our changing climate and build resilience to weather-related risk.[17]
