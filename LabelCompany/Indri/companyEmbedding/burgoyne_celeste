lululemon athletica Promotes Celeste Burgoyne to Executive Vice 
      President, Retail, Americas
























VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec 12, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
lululemon athletica inc.                 

/quotes/zigman/39660/composite LULU
-0.90%


 today announced the promotion of 
      Celeste Burgoyne to Executive Vice President (EVP), Retail, Americas, 
      effective immediately. She continues to report to the Company’s CEO, 
      Laurent Potdevin, and will be responsible for continuing to lead the 
      Americas retail organization.


                                        








“Celeste is a powerful leader who embodies our culture, values and 
      consistently delivers exceptional results through her experience, 
      passion and deep knowledge of our operations across the Americas,” said 
      lululemon’s CEO, Laurent Potdevin. “The Americas is our largest 
      operation and remains a critical part of our future. I know Celeste’s 
      leadership will ensure a laser focus on expanding our footprint, 
      exploring new formats and creating new and engaging ways to connect with 
      our guests.”


                                        








Ms. Burgoyne has been with lululemon since 2006 and most recently served 
      as Senior Vice President, Retail, North America where she was 
      responsible for overseeing all Canadian and U.S. Retail. Prior to that, 
      she held the positions of Vice President of Store Operations and General 
      Manager or U.S. Operations. Celeste started her career with Abercrombie 
      & Fitch, where she held various positions during her ten years with the 
      company, including most recently, Senior Director of Stores.


                                        








“With over a decade at lululemon, I am honoured to have the opportunity 
      to continue leading our amazing teams into our next chapter in the 
      Americas,” said Celeste Burgoyne, EVP, Retail, Americas. “I am as 
      committed as the day I joined to the concept that our stores and our 
      retail team are the heart of this business and the magic which fuels our 
      success. Through constantly challenging ourselves to push boundaries, I 
      am continually inspired by our team’s ability to elevate the guest 
      experience as we bring product to life and drive deeper more powerful 
      connections within the communities we serve. Together as a team, there 
      is so much exciting opportunity ahead of us.”


                                        








Ms. Burgoyne holds a Bachelor of Arts from the University of San Diego 
      in 1996. An avid runner, road rider and yogi, Celeste and her two young 
      boys are delighted to call Vancouver home with frequent visits to 
      Whistler for all their snowy pursuits.

Stop deflecting to Obama. Obama has broken zero laws as POTUS. This is a verifiable fact. The GOP would have already impeached him in those 6 years they had control of congress if he did. The biggest criminal and traitor having committed high treason is none other than cheetos jesus himself. You can find him in the white house tweeting at any moment. For some unknown reason the GOP is cowering in fear of this fraud. The trumpanzees just want someone to worship, even if it is an orange pile of #$%$. They want to express their anger at all other Americans for having elected Obama president, and their unjustified hate for Clinton. And if the Constituion, "Declaration of Independence", Comey, Colbert, or any other document, investigator, journalist, messengers, comedian, etc. happen to get in their way, they go into a fit of rage against them. They do NOT care if cheetos jesus sell off American to Russian, or if "R" in republican is now the same as "Russians". They just want to see the world burn because they are angry and #$%$ off at everything, and for others not respecting their special white snow flake status.Join the Conversation1 / 5461
