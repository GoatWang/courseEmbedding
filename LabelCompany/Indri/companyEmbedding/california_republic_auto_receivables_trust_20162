the tenor of the Definitive Notes in lieu of which they are issued
and with such variations not inconsistent with the terms of this
Indenture as the officers executing such Notes may determine, as
evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

(b) If temporary Notes are issued,
the Issuer shall cause Definitive Notes to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. After the preparation of Definitive Notes, the
temporary Notes shall be exchangeable for Definitive Notes upon
surrender of the temporary Notes at the Agency Office, without
charge to the surrendering Noteholder. Upon surrender for
cancellation of any one or more temporary Notes, the Issuer shall
execute, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
in exchange therefor, a like tenor and principal amount of
Definitive Notes of the same Class or Classes and authorized
denominations. Until so exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
Definitive Notes.

Section 2.04. Registration;
Registration of Transfer and Exchange .

(a) The Issuer shall cause to be
kept a register (the “Note Register”) in which, subject
to such reasonable regulations as the Issuer may prescribe, the
Issuer shall provide for the registration of the Notes and the
registration of transfers and exchanges of the Notes. The Indenture
Trustee shall initially be the registrar (the “Note
Registrar”) for the purpose of registering the Notes and
transfers of the Notes as herein provided. Upon any resignation of
the Note Registrar, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor
Note Registrar or, if it elects not to make such an appointment,
assume the duties of the Note Registrar.

(b) If a Person other than the
Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the
Issuer shall give the Indenture Trustee prompt written notice of
the appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any
change in the location, of the Note Register. The Indenture Trustee
shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable
times and to obtain copies thereof, and to rely upon a certificate
executed on behalf of the Note Registrar by an Authorized Officer
thereof as to the names and addresses of the Noteholders and the
principal amounts and number of such Notes.

(c) Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Note at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Indenture Trustee or the Agency Office, if the requirements of
Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner Trustee shall
execute, on behalf of the Issuer, and the Indenture
Trustee
 
4


shall authenticate and deliver to the Noteholder
making such surrender and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denomination and a like aggregate principal
amount.

(d) At the option of a Noteholder,
Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of the same Class in any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount and
upon surrender of such Notes to be exchanged at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Indenture Trustee or the Agency Office, if the
requirements of Section 8-401 of the UCC are met, the Owner
Trustee shall execute, on behalf of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the
Indenture Trustee, the Notes that the Noteholder making such
exchange is entitled to receive.

Every Note presented or surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by
the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and
substance satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee, duly executed by
the Holder thereof or its attorney-in-fact duly authorized in
writing.

All Notes issued upon any
registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid
obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the same debt, and entitled
to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

No service charge shall be made to a
Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes,
but the Issuer or Indenture Trustee may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection therewith, other than exchanges pursuant
to Section 2.03(b) or Section 9.05 not involving any
transfer.

(e) The preceding provisions of this
Section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to
transfer or make exchanges, and the Note Registrar need not
register transfers or exchanges, (i) of Notes that are due for
repayment within 15 days of submission to the Corporate Trust
Office or the Agency Office or (ii) of Notes selected for
redemption.

(f) Each Person to whom a Note is
transferred will be required to represent, in the case of a
Definitive Note, or deemed to represent, in the case of a
Book-Entry Note, that either (i) it is not, and it is not
investing on behalf of or with plan assets of (A) an
“employee benefit plan” as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, which is subject to Title I of ERISA, (B) a
“plan” as defined in Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code, which is subject to Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code, (C) an entity deemed to hold “plan
assets” of any of the foregoing by reason of investment by an
employee benefit plan or plan in such entity, or (D) a
governmental, non-U.S. or church plan which is subject to any
Similar Law or (ii) the acquisition, holding and disposition
of the note will not give rise to a nonexempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Internal Revenue Code or a non-exempt violation of any Similar
Law.

(g) The Indenture Trustee shall not
be responsible for ascertaining whether any transfer complies with,
or for otherwise monitoring or determining compliance with, the
requirements or terms of the Securities Act, applicable State
securities laws, ERISA or the Code;
 
5


except that if a certificate and other
documentation or evidence are specifically required by the terms of
this Section to be provided to the Indenture Trustee by a
prospective transferor or transferee, the Indenture Trustee shall
be under a duty to receive and examine the same to determine
whether it conforms substantially on its face as to the applicable
requirements of this Section.

(h) Any Notes retained (i.e., held
on the Closing Date) by (i) the Issuer or (ii) the single
beneficial owner of the Issuer for U.S. federal income tax purposes
may not be transferred to another Person (other than a Person that
is considered the same Person as the Issuer or its single
beneficial owner, as the case may be, for United States federal
income tax purposes) unless the Administrator shall cause an
Opinion of Counsel to be delivered to the Depositor and the
Indenture Trustee at such time stating that (A) such Notes
will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax
purposes and (B) the sale of such Notes will not cause the
Issuer to be taxable as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation. In addition, if for tax or
other reasons it may be necessary to track such Notes (e.g., if the
Notes have original issue discount), tracking conditions such as
requiring that such Notes be in definitive registered form may be
required by the Administrator as a condition to such
transfer.

(i) Any purported transfer of a Note
not in accordance with this Section shall be null and void and
shall not be given effect for any purpose whatsoever.

Section 2.05. Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes .

(a) If (i) any mutilated Note
is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee
receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, (ii) there is delivered to the Issuer and
the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as may be
reasonably required to hold them harmless and (iii) the
requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, then, in the
absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a Protected
Purchaser, the Issuer shall execute, and the Indenture Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any
such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note
of like tenor and principal amount; provided, however, that if any
such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note,
shall have become or within 15 days shall be due and payable,
or shall have been called for redemption, instead of issuing a
replacement Note, the Issuer may pay such destroyed, lost or stolen
Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption Date without
surrender thereof. If, after the delivery of such replacement Note
or payment of a destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a Protected
Purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement
Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to recover such
replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom such
replacement Note was delivered or any Person taking such
replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was
delivered or any assignee of such Person, except a Protected
Purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security or
indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost
or expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in
connection therewith.

(b) Upon the issuance of any
replacement Note under this Section, the Issuer may require the
payment by the Holder of such Note of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other
 
6


governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other reasonable expenses (including the
fees and expenses of the Indenture Trustee) connected
therewith.

(c) Every replacement Note issued
pursuant to this Section in replacement of any mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or wrongfully taken Note shall be at any
time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all of the
benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

(d) The provisions of this
Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent
lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes.

Section 2.06. Persons Deemed
Owners . Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer
of any Note, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee, the Note Registrar
and any agent of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Note
Registrar may treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered
(as of the day of determination) as the owner of such Note for the
purpose of receiving payments of principal of and interest, if any,
on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not
such Note be overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Note Registrar or any agent of the Issuer, the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be affected by notice to
the contrary.

Section 2.07. Payment of
Principal and Interest .

(a) The Notes shall accrue interest
during each Interest Period at the applicable Interest Rate,
calculated in accordance with the terms of the Notes, and shall be
payable from amounts deposited in the Collection Account in
accordance with Section 5.04(a) of the Sale and Servicing
Agreement or Section 5.04(b) hereof. Interest accrued on the
Notes during an Interest Period shall be due and payable on the
related Payment Date.

(b) The principal of the Notes will
be due and payable in accordance with Section 5.04(b) of the
Sale and Servicing Agreement or Section 5.04(b) hereof. The
principal of the Notes shall also be due and payable as follows:
(i) on the Redemption Date, in an amount equal to the
outstanding Note Balance, (ii) on the date of acceleration of
the maturity of the Notes pursuant to Section 5.02 in the
amount of the outstanding Note Balance and (iii) on the
related Final Scheduled Payment Date for any Class of Notes to the
extent that the Note Balance of such Class of Notes has not been
reduced to zero prior to such date, in an amount equal to the Note
Balance of such Class of Notes.

(c) Any installment of interest or
principal payable with respect to a Note that is punctually paid or
duly provided for by the Issuer on the applicable Payment Date
shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Note is registered
on the related Record Date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of any such Noteholder at a bank or
other entity having appropriate facilities therefor, if such
Noteholder shall have provided the Indenture Trustee with wiring
instructions no less than two Business Days prior to the related
Record Date (which wiring instructions may be in the form of a
standing order applicable to all subsequent Payment Dates), or
otherwise by check mailed to the address of such Noteholder as it
appears in
 
7


the Note Register; provided, however, that with
respect to Book-Entry Notes registered on the applicable Record
Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially,
such nominee to be Cede & Co.) for which Definitive Notes
have not been issued pursuant to Section 2.12, payment shall
be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
Cede & Co., for further credit to the account designated
by such Holder. The final distribution on each Note will be made in
like manner, but only upon presentation and surrender of such Note
at the Corporate Trust Office of the Indenture Trustee or such
other location specified in the notice to Noteholders of such final
distribution. With respect to Book-Entry Notes for which Definitive
Notes have not been issued, such notice shall be sent on the
Business Day prior to such Payment Date by facsimile, and with
respect to Definitive Notes, such notice shall be sent not later
than three Business Days after such Record Date in accordance with
Section 11.05, and, in each case, shall specify that such
final installment shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of such Note and shall specify the place where such Note
may be presented and surrendered for payment of such installment.
The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any failure to
provide notice to the Noteholders as required pursuant to this
subsection to the extent it has not received notice of such
expected Final Scheduled Payment Date from the Issuer not later
than two Business Days after the Record Date. Notices in connection
with redemptions of Notes shall be mailed to Noteholders as
provided in Section 10.02. The funds represented by any such
checks returned undelivered shall be held in accordance with
Section 3.03. The final interest payment on each Class of
Notes is due on the date on which the Note Balance of that Class of
Notes is reduced to zero (including any Redemption Date and the
applicable Final Scheduled Payment Date).

Section 2.08.
Cancellation . All Notes surrendered for payment,
registration of transfer, exchange or redemption shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Indenture Trustee, be
delivered to the Indenture Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled
by the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer may at any time deliver to the
Indenture Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder that the Issuer may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall
be promptly cancelled by the Indenture Trustee. No Notes shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes cancelled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture. All cancelled Notes may be held or disposed of by the
Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or
disposal policy as in effect at the time.

Section 2.09. Tax Treatment;
Withholding .

(a) The Issuer has entered into this
Indenture, and the Notes will be issued, with the intention that,
for federal, State and local income, single business and franchise
tax purposes, the Notes will qualify as indebtedness secured by the
Collateral, and, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, each
Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note (and each Note Owner by its
acceptance of an interest in the applicable Book-Entry Note) agree
that, by acquiring any Note or interest therein, that it will not
take a position contrary to such treatment. The Issuer, by entering
into this Indenture agrees solely for federal, State and local
income, single business and franchise tax purposes, (i) to
treat the Notes as indebtedness secured by the Collateral and
(ii) not to treat the Issuer as an association (or
publicly-traded partnership) taxable as a corporation, in each
case, unless such treatment has been determined to be contrary to
Applicable Law by a decision,
 
8


judgment, decree or other order by any court of
competent jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree or other
order is final and binding after all appeals allowed by Applicable
Law.

(b) In the event that any
withholding tax is imposed on payments to a Noteholder, such tax
shall reduce the amount otherwise distributable to such Noteholder
in accordance with this Section. The Indenture Trustee or the
Paying Agent is hereby authorized and directed to retain from
amounts otherwise distributable to the Noteholders sufficient funds
for the payment of any tax, including FATCA Withholding Tax, that
is legally owed with respect to such payment (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Indenture Trustee or the Paying
Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings and
withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by Applicable Law,
pending the outcome of such proceedings; provided, however, the
Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent shall not be required to
contest any tax). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with
respect to a Noteholder shall be treated as cash distributed to
such Noteholder at the time it is withheld by the Indenture Trustee
or the Paying Agent and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a payment (such as a payment to a non
U.S. Noteholder), the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent
may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this paragraph with no liability therefor.

(c) Prior to the receipt of any
interest payment, any Noteholder or its transferee that is a United
States person (as defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
shall (i) provide the Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent
with IRS Form W-9 (or successor form) or (ii) establish
to the satisfaction of the Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent
that it is exempt from backup withholding. Each Noteholder or its
transferee agrees by acceptance of a Note that, upon request of the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent, such Noteholder
or its transferee will provide the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or
the Paying Agent with a supplemental IRS Form W-9 (or
successor form) to the extent legally able to do so and that each
Noteholder or its transferee shall notify the Indenture Trustee or
the Paying Agent should subsequent circumstances render such forms
or exemptions incorrect or invalid. The Indenture Trustee and the
Paying Agent shall be fully protected in relying upon, and each
Noteholder or its transferee by its acceptance of a Note hereunder
agrees to indemnify and hold the Indenture Trustee and the Paying
Agent harmless against all claims or liability of any kind arising
in connection with or related to the Indenture Trustee’s and
the Paying Agent’s reliance upon, any documents, forms or
information provided by any Noteholder or its transferee to the
Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent pursuant to this
Section.

(d) Prior to the receipt of any
interest payment, any Noteholder, and upon transfer, any transferee
that is not a United States person (as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall provide the Indenture
Trustee and the Paying Agent with an applicable IRS Form W-8
(or successor forms). Each Noteholder or transferee agrees by
acceptance of a Note that, upon request of the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent, such Noteholder or
transferee will provide the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee or the
Paying Agent with a supplemental applicable IRS Form W-8 (or
successor forms) to the extent legally able to do so and that each
Noteholder or its transferee shall notify the Indenture Trustee or
the Paying Agent should subsequent circumstances render such forms
incorrect or invalid. The Indenture Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall be fully protected in relying upon, and each Noteholder or
its transferee by its acceptance of a Note hereunder agrees to
indemnify and hold the Indenture Trustee and the
 
9


Paying Agent harmless against all claims or
liability of any kind arising in connection with or related to the
Indenture Trustee’s and the Paying Agent’s reliance
upon, any documents, forms or information provided by any
Noteholder or its transferee to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee
or the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section.

(e) Each holder of a Note or an
interest therein, by acceptance of such Note or such interest in
such Note, will be deemed to have agreed to provide the Issuer and
the Indenture Trustee with the Tax Information. In addition, each
holder of a Note or an interest therein will be deemed to
understand that the Indenture Trustee and any other agent of the
Issuer may withhold interest and principal payable with respect to
a Note (without any corresponding gross-up) on any Noteholder or
beneficial owner of an interest in a Note that fails to comply with
the foregoing requirements.

(f) In order to comply with
applicable tax laws (inclusive of rules, regulations and
interpretations promulgated by competent authorities) related to
the Basic Documents in effect from time to time that a foreign
financial institution, issuer, trustee, paying agent or other party
is or has agreed to be subject to, the Issuer agrees (i) to
provide to the Indenture Trustee and its Affiliates sufficient
information about the parties and/or transactions (including any
modification to the terms of such transactions) so the Indenture
Trustee can determine whether it has tax related obligations under
Applicable FATCA Law, (ii) that the Indenture Trustee and its
Affiliates shall be entitled to make any withholding or deduction
from payments to the extent necessary to comply with Applicable
FATCA Law for which the Indenture Trustee and its Affiliates shall
not have any liability, and (iii) to hold harmless the
Indenture Trustee and its Affiliates for any losses it may suffer
due to the actions it takes to comply with the Applicable FATCA
Law. The terms of this Section shall survive the termination of
this Indenture.

Section 2.10. Book-Entry
Notes . Except as provided in Section 2.12, the Notes,
upon original issuance, shall be issued in the form of a
typewritten Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes, which
shall be deposited on behalf of the purchasers of the Notes
represented by such Book-Entry Note with the Indenture Trustee, as
custodian for DTC, the initial Clearing Agency. The Book-Entry
Notes shall be registered initially on the Note Register in the
name of Cede & Co., the nominee of the initial Clearing
Agency, and no Note Owner will receive a Definitive Note
representing such Note Owner’s interest in such Book-Entry
Notes, except as provided in Section 2.12. Unless and until
Definitive Notes have been issued to Note Owners pursuant to
Section 2.12:

(a) the provisions of this
Section shall be in full force and effect;

(b) the Note Registrar, the Paying
Agent and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the
Clearing Agency for all purposes of this Indenture (including the
payment of principal of and interest on the Notes and the giving of
instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole Holder of the
Notes, and shall have no obligation to the Note Owners;

(c) to the extent that the
provisions of this Section conflict with any other provisions
of this Indenture, the provisions of this Section shall
control;
 
10



(d) the rights of the Note Owners
shall be exercised only through the Clearing Agency and shall be
limited to those established by Applicable Law and agreements
between such Note Owners and the Clearing Agency or the Clearing
Agency Participants and, pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement,
unless and until Definitive Notes are issued pursuant to
Section 2.12, the Clearing Agency shall make book-entry
transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and receive and
transmit payments of principal of and interest on the Notes to
Clearing Agency Participants; and

(e) whenever this Indenture requires
or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or
directions of the Holders of Notes (or the Holders of any Class,
including the Controlling Class) evidencing a specified percentage
of the Note Balance, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to
represent such percentage only to the extent that it has
(i) received written instructions to such effect from Note
Owners and/or Clearing Agency Participants owning or representing,
respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in the Notes or such Class of Notes and (ii) delivered such
instructions to the Indenture Trustee.

Section 2.11. Notices to
Clearing Agency . Whenever a notice or other communication to
the Noteholders is required under this Indenture, unless and until
Definitive Notes shall have been issued to the related Note Owners
pursuant to Section 2.12, the Indenture Trustee shall give all
such notices and communications specified herein to be given to the
related Noteholders to the Clearing Agency and shall have no
obligation to such Note Owners.

Section 2.12. Definitive
Notes . Definitive Notes will be issued only if:

(i)(a) the Clearing Agency is no
longer willing or able to properly discharge its responsibilities
with respect to the Book-Entry Notes and (b) the Indenture
Trustee is not able to locate a qualified successor; or

(ii) after the occurrence of an
Event of Default, owners of Book-Entry Notes representing
beneficial interests aggregating not less 51% of the Note Balance
of a Class of Notes advise the Indenture Trustee and the Clearing
Agency Participant through the Clearing Agency in writing that the
continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is
no longer in the best interests of such Note Owners.

In each case, the Indenture Trustee
shall then notify Note Owners of the related Class of Notes through
the Clearing Agency of the occurrence of any such event and of the
availability of Definitive Notes of the related Class of Notes to
Note Owners requesting the same.

Upon surrender to the Indenture
Trustee of the Notes or Notes representing such Book-Entry Notes by
the Clearing Agency, accompanied by registration instructions, the
Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate
the related Definitive Notes in accordance with the instructions of
the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the
Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such
instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of
Definitive Notes, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the Holders
of such Definitive Notes as Noteholders.
 
11



If Definitive Notes are issued and
the Indenture Trustee is not the Note Registrar, the Issuer shall
furnish or cause to be furnished to the Indenture Trustee a list of
the names and addresses of the Noteholders (i) as of each
Record Date, within five days thereafter and (ii) within
30 days after receipt by the Issuer of a request
therefor.

Section 2.13. Depositor as
Noteholder . The Depositor, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes and, except as
otherwise provided herein, may otherwise deal with the Issuer or
its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
the Depositor.

Section 2.14. Authenticating
Agents . Upon the request of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee
may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents with power to act on
its behalf and subject to its direction in the authentication of
Notes in connection with issuance, transfers and exchanges under
Sections 2.02, 2.03, 2.05 and 2.06, as fully to all intents
and purposes as though each such Authenticating Agent had been
expressly authorized by such Sections to authenticate such Notes.
For all purposes of this Indenture, the authentication of Notes by
an Authenticating Agent pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to
be the authentication of Notes “by the Indenture
Trustee”.

Any entity into which any
Authenticating Agent may be merged or converted or with which it
may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger,
consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating Agent shall
be a party, or any entity succeeding to all or substantially all of
the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be
the successor of such Authenticating Agent hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any document or any further act on the part
of the parties hereto or such Authenticating Agent or such
successor entity.

Section 3.01. Payment of
Principal and Interest . The Issuer will duly and punctually
pay the principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes, and all
other amounts owing hereunder or in respect of the Notes, in
accordance with the terms of the Notes, this Indenture and the Sale
and Servicing Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, subject to
Section 8.02(c), on each Payment Date, the Issuer shall cause
all amounts deposited pursuant to the Sale and Servicing Agreement
for the benefit of the Notes to be paid to the Noteholders. Amounts
properly withheld under the Code by any Person from a payment to
any Noteholder of interest and/or principal shall be considered as
having been paid by the Issuer to such Noteholder for all purposes
of this Indenture.

Section 3.02. Maintenance of
Office or Agency . So long as any of the Notes remain
Outstanding, the Issuer will maintain in St. Paul, Minnesota an
office or agency where Notes may be surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the
Issuer in respect of the Notes and this Indenture may be served.
The Issuer hereby initially appoints the Indenture Trustee to serve
as its agent for the foregoing purposes. Such office will initially
be located at the Corporate Trust Office. The Issuer will give
prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of the location, and
of any change in the location, of any such office or agency. If at
any time the Issuer shall fail to maintain any such office or
agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture Trustee with the
address thereof, such surrenders, notices and demands may be made
or served at the Corporate Trust Office, and the Issuer hereby
appoints the Indenture Trustee as its agent to receive all such
surrenders, notices and demands.

Section 3.03. Money for
Payments to Be Held in Trust . All payments of amounts due and
payable with respect to any Notes that are to be made from amounts
withdrawn from the Trust Accounts shall be made on behalf of the
Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by a Paying Agent, and no
amounts so withdrawn from any Trust Account for payments of Notes
shall be paid over to the Issuer except as provided in this
Section.

be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto,
and (unless the Paying Agent is the Indenture Trustee) shall
promptly notify the Indenture Trustee, in writing, of its action or
failure so to act.

The Issuer will cause each Paying
Agent other than the Indenture Trustee to execute and deliver to
the Indenture Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Indenture Trustee (and if the Indenture
Trustee acts as Paying Agent, it hereby so agrees), subject to the
provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

(i) hold all sums held by it for the
payment of amounts due with respect to the Notes in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall
be
 
13



paid to such Persons or otherwise
disposed of as herein provided and pay such sums to such Persons as
herein provided;

(ii) give the Indenture Trustee
written notice of any default by the Issuer (or any other obligor
on the Notes) of which it has actual knowledge in the making of any
payment required to be made with respect to the Notes;

(iii) at any time during the
continuance of any such default, upon the written request of the
Indenture Trustee, forthwith pay to the Indenture Trustee all sums
so held in trust by such Paying Agent;

of the Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such
trust money shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the
Indenture Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to
make any such repayment, shall at the expense and written direction
of the Issuer cause to be published once, in a newspaper published
in the English language, customarily published on each Business Day

therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of
such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be repaid to the Issuer. The Indenture Trustee shall
also adopt and employ, at the expense and written direction of the

repayment (including mailing notice of such repayment to Holders
whose Notes have been called but have not been surrendered for
redemption or whose right to or interest in monies due and payable
but not claimed is determinable from the records of the Indenture
Trustee or of any Paying Agent, at the last address of record for
each such Holder).

ARTICLE FIVE

EVENTS OF DEFAULT;
REMEDIES

Section 5.01. Events of
Default . “Event of Default”, wherever used herein,
means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary
or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Authority):

(a) default in the payment of any
interest on any Note of the Controlling Class when the same becomes
due and payable, and such default shall continue for a period of
five days;

(b) default in the payment of the
principal of any Note on the related Final Scheduled Payment Date
or the Redemption Date;

(c) any failure by the Issuer to
duly observe or perform any of its covenants or agreements or a
breach of any of its representations and warranties in this
Indenture (other than as specified above in clauses (a) and
(b)), which failure has a Material Adverse Effect on the
Noteholders and which continues unremedied for a period of
30 days after there shall have been given, by registered or
certified mail, to the Issuer by the Depositor or the Indenture
Trustee or to the Issuer, the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee,
by the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 25% of the Note
Balance of the Controlling Class of Notes, a written notice
specifying such default and requiring it to be remedied and stating
that such notice is a “Notice of Default” hereunder;
or

(d) the occurrence of an Insolvency
Event with respect to the Issuer.

The Issuer shall promptly (but in
any event not later than five Business Days) deliver to the
Depositor and the Indenture Trustee written notice in the form of
an Officer’s Certificate of any event that with the giving of
notice, the lapse of time or both would become an Event of Default
under clause (c) above, its status and what action the Issuer
is taking or proposes to take with respect thereto.

Section 5.02. Acceleration
of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment .

(a) If an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 5.01(d)), the Indenture Trustee may, or
if so requested in writing by the Noteholders representing not less
than 51% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class, shall,
declare by written notice to the Issuer all of the Notes to be
immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration (but
subject to Section 5.02(b)) the entire outstanding Note
Balance, together with accrued interest thereon through the date of
acceleration, shall become immediately due and payable as provided
in the Notes. If following the occurrence of an Event of Default
(other than an Event of Default specified in Section 5.01(d)),
the Indenture Trustee has not declared the Notes to be immediately
due and payable, the Issuer shall continue to pay interest and
principal on the Notes on each Payment Date in accordance with
Section 5.04 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, until the
Notes are accelerated or until a liquidation, if any, of
the
 
26


Collateral. If an Event of Default specified in
Section 5.01(d) shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Notes shall automatically become immediately due and payable
without any further action on the part of any Person.

(b) If the Notes have been declared
immediately due and payable following an Event of Default, before a
judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained
by the Indenture Trustee as provided hereinafter in this Article,
the Noteholders representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance
of the Controlling Class may, by written notice to the Issuer, the
Depositor and the Indenture Trustee, rescind such declaration and
annul such consequences if:

(i) the Issuer has paid or deposited
with the Indenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay:

(A) all payments of principal of and
interest on all Notes and all other amounts that would then be due
hereunder or upon such Notes if the Event of Default giving rise to
such acceleration had not occurred; and

(B) all sums paid by the Indenture
Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses and
disbursements of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel
and the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements of the
Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel; and

(ii) all Events of Default, other
than the nonpayment of the principal of the Notes that has become
due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as
provided in Section 5.12.

No such rescission shall affect any
subsequent default or impair any right consequent
thereto.

Section 5.03. Collection of
Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Indenture Trustee
.

(a) The Issuer covenants that if
(i) a default is made in the payment of any interest on any
Note of the Controlling Class when the same becomes due and
payable, and such default continues for a period of five days, or
(ii) a default is made in the payment of the principal of or
any installment of the principal of any Note on the related Final
Scheduled Payment Date, the Issuer will, upon demand of the
Noteholders representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance of
the Controlling Class, pay to the Indenture Trustee, for the
benefit of the Noteholders, the entire amount then due and payable
on such Notes in respect of principal and interest, with interest
on the overdue principal at the applicable Interest Rate and, to
the extent payment at such rate of interest shall be legally
enforceable, on overdue installments of interest at the applicable
Interest Rate and, in addition thereto, such further amount as
shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection,
including the reasonable compensation, expenses and disbursements
of the Indenture Trustee and its agents and counsel.

(b) In case the Issuer shall fail
forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand or if any such
amounts became due and payable automatically pursuant to the terms
of Section 5.02(a), the Indenture Trustee, in its own name and
as trustee of an express trust, may
 
27


(and at the written direction of the Noteholders
representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance of the
Controlling Class shall) institute a Proceeding for the collection
of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such Proceeding to
judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the
Issuer or other obligor on such Notes and collect in the manner
provided by law out of the Collateral or the property of any other
obligor on such Notes, wherever situated, the monies adjudged or
decreed to be payable.

(c) If an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may, as more particularly
provided in Section 5.04, or shall at the written direction of
the Noteholders representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance
of the Controlling Class, proceed to protect and enforce its rights
and the rights of the Noteholders, by such appropriate Proceedings
as the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders, if the Indenture
Trustee is acting at the written direction of Noteholders
representing no less than 51% of the Note Balance of the
Controlling Class, shall reasonably deem most effective to protect
and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement
of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the
exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other
proper remedy or legal or equitable right vested in the Indenture
Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

(d) In case there shall be pending,
relative to the Issuer or any other obligor on the Notes or any
Person having or claiming an ownership interest in the Collateral,
Proceedings under any Insolvency Law, or if a receiver, assignee or
trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator
or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken
possession of the Issuer or its property or such other obligor or
Person, or in case of any other comparable judicial Proceedings
relative to the Issuer or other obligor on the Notes, or to the
creditors or property of the Issuer or such other obligor, the
Indenture Trustee, irrespective of whether the principal of any
Notes shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Indenture
Trustee shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of
this Section, shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in
such Proceedings or otherwise:

(i) to file and prove a claim or
claims for the entire amount of principal and interest owing and
unpaid in respect of the Notes and to file such other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the
claims of the Indenture Trustee (including any claim for reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee and each predecessor
Indenture Trustee, and their respective agents and counsel, and for
all expenses and other amounts due and owing to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to Section 6.07) and of the Noteholders
allowed in such Proceedings;

(ii) unless prohibited by Applicable
Law, to vote on behalf of the Noteholders in any election of a
trustee, a standby trustee or Person performing similar functions
in any such Proceedings;

(iii) to collect and receive any
monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and to distribute all amounts received with respect to the claims
of the Noteholders and of the Indenture Trustee on their behalf;
and
 
28



(iv) to file such proofs of claim
and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the claims of the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders allowed in any Proceedings relative to the Issuer, its
creditors and its property;

and any trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official in any such
Proceeding is hereby authorized by each of such Noteholders to make
payments to the Indenture Trustee for application in accordance
with Section 5.04 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement and, in
the event that the Indenture Trustee shall consent to the making of
payments directly to such Noteholders, to pay to the Indenture
Trustee such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable
compensation to the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture
Trustee and their respective agents and counsel, and all other
expenses and amounts due and owing to the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to Section 6.07.

(e) Nothing herein contained shall
be deemed to authorize the Indenture Trustee to authorize or
consent to or vote for or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Noteholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof
or to authorize the Indenture Trustee to vote in respect of the
claim of any Noteholder in any such Proceeding except, as
aforesaid, to vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or
similar Person.

(f) All rights of action and of
asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the Notes,
may be enforced by the Indenture Trustee without the possession of
any of the Notes or the production thereof in any trial or other
Proceedings relative thereto, and any such action or Proceedings
instituted by the Indenture Trustee shall be brought in its own
name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment,
subject to the payment of the expenses, disbursements and
compensation of the Indenture Trustee, each predecessor Indenture
Trustee and their respective agents and attorneys, shall be for the
ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes.

(g) In any Proceedings brought by
the Indenture Trustee (and also any Proceedings involving the
interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Indenture Trustee shall be a party), the Indenture Trustee shall be
held to represent all of the Holders of the Notes, and it shall not
be necessary to make any Noteholder a party to any such
Proceedings.

Section 5.04. Remedies;
Priorities .

(a) If the Notes have been declared
to be immediately due and payable following an Event of Default,
the Indenture Trustee may, and at the written direction of the
Noteholders representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance of
the Controlling Class shall, take one or more of the following
action (subject to Sections 5.02 and 5.05):

(i) institute Proceedings in its own
name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all
amounts then payable on the Notes or under this Indenture with
respect thereto, whether by declaration or otherwise, enforce any
judgment obtained and collect from the Issuer and any other obligor
on such Notes monies adjudged due;
 
29



(ii) institute Proceedings from time
to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of this Indenture
with respect to the Collateral;

(iii) exercise any remedies of a
secured party under the UCC and take any other appropriate action

Trustee and the Holders of the Notes; and

(iv) sell or otherwise liquidate the
Collateral or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein, at
one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any
manner permitted by Applicable Law;

provided, however, notwithstanding
anything else herein to the contrary, that the Indenture Trustee
may not sell or otherwise liquidate the Collateral following an
Event of Default, other than an Event of Default described in
Section 5.01(a) or (b), unless: (A) the Noteholders
representing 100% of the Note Balance consent thereto, (B) the
proceeds of such sale or liquidation will be sufficient to pay in
full all amounts then due and unpaid on such Notes in respect of
principal and interest, or (C) the Indenture Trustee
determines that the Collateral will not continue to provide
sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and interest on
the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been
declared immediately due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee
obtains the consent of the Noteholders representing 66-2/3% of the
Note Balance.

In determining such sufficiency or
insufficiency with respect to clause (B) and (C) above,
the Indenture Trustee may, at the Issuer’s expense, but need
not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Collateral for such purpose.

(b) If the Indenture Trustee
collects any money or property pursuant to this Article as a result
of selling or liquidating the Collateral, it shall pay out such
money or property, together with all other Available Collections

Payment Date or other date fixed pursuant to Section 5.04(c)

Note Interest, respectively;
 
30



(iv) fourth, if (A) the
Receivables have been sold after an Event of Default has occurred
or (B) an Event of Default described in Section 5.01(a),

priority:

(A) to the Holders of the
Class A-1 Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class A-1 Notes have been Paid in full;

(B) pro rata, to the Holders of
the Class A-2 Notes, the Holders of the Class A-3 Notes

Class C Notes, the Accrued Class C Note
Interest;

(F) to the Holders of the
Class C Notes in respect of principal thereon until the
Class C Notes have been Paid in full;

(vi) sixth, any remaining funds
shall be distributed to the Certificateholders.

(c) The Indenture Trustee may fix a
record date and payment date for any payment to Noteholders
pursuant to this Section. At least 15 days before such record
date, the Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder and the
Servicer a notice that states the record date, the payment date and
the amount to be paid.

Section 5.05. Optional
Preservation of the Collateral . If the Notes have been
declared to be due and payable under Section 5.02 following an
Event of Default, and such declaration and its consequences have
not been rescinded and annulled, the Indenture Trustee may, but
need not, elect to maintain possession of the Collateral and
continue to apply the proceeds thereof as if there had been no
declaration of acceleration in the manner specified in
Section 5.04 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement. It is the
desire of the parties hereto and the Noteholders that there be at
all times sufficient funds for the payment of principal of and
interest on the Notes, and the Indenture Trustee shall take such
desire into account when determining whether or not to maintain
possession of the Collateral. In determining whether to maintain
possession of the Collateral, the Indenture Trustee may, but need
not, obtain and rely upon an opinion of an Independent investment
banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the
feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of
the Collateral for such purpose.

Section 5.06. Limitation of
Suits .

(a) No Noteholder shall have any
right to institute any Proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with
respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or
trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless:

(i) such Holder has previously given
written notice to the Indenture Trustee of a continuing Event of
Default;

(ii) the Holders evidencing not less
than 25% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class have made
written request to the Indenture Trustee to institute such
Proceeding in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
Indenture Trustee hereunder;

(iii) such Holder or Holders have
offered to the Indenture Trustee reasonable indemnity satisfactory
to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities that may be
incurred in complying with such request;

(iv) the Indenture Trustee for
30 days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of
indemnity has failed to institute such Proceedings; and

(v) no direction inconsistent with
such written request has been given to the Indenture Trustee during
such 30-day period by Noteholders evidencing not less than not less
than 51% of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class.

(b) It is understood and intended
that no one or more Noteholders shall have any right in any manner
whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision of this
Indenture to affect,
 
32


disturb or prejudice the rights of any other
Noteholders or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or
preference over any other Noteholders or to enforce any right under
this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided.

(c) In the event the Indenture
Trustee shall receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and
indemnity from two or more groups of Noteholders pursuant to this
Section, each representing less than 51% but not less than 25% of
the Note Balance of the Controlling Class of Notes, the Indenture
Trustee shall take such action as is requested by Noteholders
representing the greatest percentage interest, notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Indenture.

Section 5.07. Unconditional
Rights of Noteholders to Receive Principal and Interest .
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture, the Holder
of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and interest,
if any, on such Note on or after the respective due dates thereof
expressed in such Note or in this Indenture (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date) and to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment, and such right shall not
be impaired without the consent of such Holder. !

Section 5.08. Restoration of
Rights and Remedies . If the Indenture Trustee or any
Noteholder has instituted any Proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such Proceeding has been
discontinued or abandoned for any reason or has been determined
adversely to the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholder, then and in
every such case the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the
Noteholders shall, subject to any determination in such Proceeding,
be restored severally and respectively to their former positions
hereunder, and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Indenture
Trustee and the Noteholders shall continue as though no such
Proceeding had been instituted.

Section 5.09. Rights and
Remedies Cumulative . No right or remedy herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and
remedy shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, be
cumulative and in addition to every other right and remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion
or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 5.10. Delay or
Omission Not a Waiver . No delay or omission of the Indenture
Trustee or any Noteholder to exercise any right or remedy accruing
upon any Default or Event of Default shall impair any such right or
remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Default or Event of
Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by
this Article or by Applicable Law to the Indenture Trustee or the
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may
be deemed expedient, by the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders,
as the case may be.

Section 5.11. Control by
Controlling Class . The Holders of 51% or more of the Note
Balance of the Controlling Class shall have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any Proceeding for any remedy
available to the Indenture Trustee with respect to the Notes or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Indenture Trustee;
provided, that:
 
33



(i) such direction shall not be
inconsistent with any rule of law or with this
Indenture;

(ii) the Indenture Trustee may take
any other action reasonably deemed proper by the Indenture Trustee
that is not inconsistent with such direction;

(iii) subject to the terms of
Section 5.04, any direction to the Indenture Trustee to sell
or liquidate the Collateral shall be by Holders of Notes evidencing
not less than 100% of the Note Balance of the Outstanding Notes;
and

(iv) if the conditions set forth in
Section 5.05 have been satisfied and the Indenture Trustee
elects to retain the Collateral pursuant to such Section, then any
direction to the Indenture Trustee by the Holders of Notes
evidencing less than 100% of the Note Balance of the Outstanding
Notes to sell or liquidate the Collateral shall be of no force and
effect.

Notwithstanding the rights of
Noteholders set forth in this Section, subject to
Section 6.01, the Indenture Trustee need not take any action
that it determines might involve it in liability for which it will
not be adequately indemnified or might materially adversely affect
the rights of any Noteholders not consenting to such
action.

Section 5.12. Waiver of Past
Defaults . Prior to the declaration of the acceleration of the
maturity of the Notes as provided in Section 5.02, the
Noteholders representing not less than 51% of the Note Balance of
the Controlling Class may, on behalf of all Noteholders, waive any
past Default or Event of Default and its consequences except a
Default or Event of Default (i) in payment of principal of or
interest on any of the Notes, (ii) in respect of a covenant or
provision hereof that cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the Holder of each Note or (iii) arising from the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the Issuer. In
the case of any such waiver, the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and
the Holders of the Notes shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereto.

Upon any such waiver, such Default
or Event of Default shall cease to exist and be deemed to have been
cured and not to have occurred, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured and not to have
occurred, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereto.

Section 5.13. Undertaking
for Costs . All parties to this Indenture agree, and each
Noteholder by such Holder’s acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion
require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Indenture Trustee
for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Indenture
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit,

Exhibit 36.1 
CERTIFICATION
 I, John Wilcox,
certify as of March�9, 2016 that:  1. I have reviewed the prospectus relating to�the Class�A-1, Class�A-2,
Class�A-3, Class�A-4, Class�B and Class�C Notes of California Republic Auto Receivables Trust 2016-1 (the �securities�) and am familiar with, in all material respects, the following:�The characteristics of the
securitized assets underlying the offering (the �securitized assets�), the structure of the securitization, and all material underlying transaction agreements as described in the prospectus; 
2. Based on my knowledge, the prospectus does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading;
 3. Based on my
knowledge, the prospectus and other information included in the registration statement of which it is a part fairly present, in all material respects, the characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the securitization and the risks
of ownership of the securities, including the risks relating to the securitized assets that would affect the cash flows available to service payments or distributions on the securities in accordance with their terms; and

4. Based on my knowledge, taking into account all material aspects of the characteristics of the securitized assets, the structure of the
securitization, and the related risks as described in the prospectus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the securitization is structured to produce, but is not guaranteed by this certification to produce, expected cash flows at times and
in amounts to service scheduled payments of interest and the ultimate repayment of principal on the securities (or other scheduled or required distributions on the securities, however denominated) in accordance with their terms as described in the
prospectus.
 The foregoing certifications are given subject to any and all defenses available to me under the federal securities laws,
including any and all defenses available to an executive officer that signed the registration statement of which the prospectus referred to in this certification is part

Date: March�9, 2016.  �
