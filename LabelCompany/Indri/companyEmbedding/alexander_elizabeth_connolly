Winter Wedding Is Being Planned By Miss Connolly
Published: August 27, 1989









                    Mr. and Mrs. James A. Connolly of North Falmouth, Mass., and St. Petersburg, Fla., have announced the engagement of their daughter Elizabeth Ann Connolly to Robert L. Alexander, a son of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Alexander of Stamford, Conn. A January wedding is planned.        

                    Miss Connolly, a 26-year-old graduate of Tulane University, was presented at the Westchester Cotillion in 1979. She is the administrative vice president of Connolly Consulting Associates in St. Petersburg, a company founded by her father 10 years ago. He had served as the financial vice president and treasurer of Bloomingdale's and Filenes department stores and as president of Gimbels New York.        

                    Mr. Alexander, 26, graduated from the Boston University School of Management. He is the president of Alexander Systems, an installer of computer systems in Stamford. The company was founded by his father, who is its president.
