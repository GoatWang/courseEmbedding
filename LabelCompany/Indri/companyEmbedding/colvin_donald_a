In addition, most of them are bad reviews to protect people. I am taking the time to write this review because people need to know, this is the office to go to if they are ready to fix their immigration status. Edyta-Christina earned every word of this review. She truly is an expert and professional in her field of work. Edyta-Christina takes pride in her work, she will accept nothing less than a perfect Immigration packet to send to Immigration Officers. She will ask you for a lot of pictures, documents, bills, and anything that will assist showing proof of your immigration status or in my case, relationship status. It will be exhausting finding all these requested documents and other forms of proof, it will take quite awhile to gather everything together, BUT I promise it will be worth it. Edyta-Christina's expertise truly showed when we first arrived to the USCIS Office for my wife's Parole in Place appointment. Our name was called and my wife was issued her Parole in Place at the window, making her status in the US officially Legal. We did not have to do an interview or anything extra like other applicants did, due to the application Edyta- Christina sent in being perfect. Our second visit was for my wife's green card. We did an interview together with an Immigration Officer, for a total time less than 30 Min. He truly did not have any questions for us other than confirming information that was in our  adjustment of status packet. Everything he needed was in our packet, making it easier on the officer to make his decision. He also said "your Lawyer did a great job with the paperwork". A week later, My wife received a letter in the mail stating her the decision was made and she was approved for a 10 year Green card. I will never forget Edyta, she is truly an amazing person, and you can tell she truly cares about her clients. Thank you Edyta.Immigration in America - Law Offices of Edyta-Christina Grzybowska GrantPeter L. ratedI am an Irish national who came to the US under the Visa Waiver Program to visit my US Citizen partner . We subsequently married and applied to adjust my status to that of a permanent resident. We knew nothing of the process beforehand so decided, given that we are a gay couple and the recent changes to the law, it would be better to use the services of an Attorney. We searched high and low and spoke to several different Attorneys but none impressed us as much as Edyta-Christina Grzybowska-Grant. We decided on retaining her over all the others due to what we first saw as her friendly, approachable, efficient manner and her excellent knowledge of the law (we had a couple of potential complicating factors to our case.) Thank goodness we chose to hire her and trusted our initial thoughts!! She was the most amazing attorney and successfully helped us get my green card in a very quick time-frame (less than 3 months from application to approval) Without Edyta, this process would have been daunting, stressful and we would definitely have done something wrong. She is so knowledgeable not only about the law but also about USCIS systems and processes. She saved us from being apart and without her kind and supportive help when we needed it, we would have been lost. I can not recommend her highly enough and I will definitely suggest to anyone considering using her services to do so. You will not find a more compassionate, professional, organized and knowledgeable attorney. Immigration in America - Law Offices of Edyta-Christina Grzybowska GrantIsma D. ratedI got my green card recently, ...I got my green card recently, 11 days ago and for 10 years.  I am flying like a bird. The process was so easy and  quick. While applying for that, I got some difficulties filling the forms. I started looking for a very good immigration lawyer who can help me with that til I found Ms. Edyta. Reading the surveys of her clients gave me hope and I called her. She is professional, available to listen, to answer tones of questions, to explain very well all what has to do with a client's case. None of the forms and the paperwork I sent have been rejected . She gives advice. you feel that this lady really loves what she does and respects her job. You feel her honesty and sincerity. She tells you what may affect your file that you take into consideration all the instructions and apply them from A to Z. She has an excellent knowledge with all what has to do with the  immigration field . I really  and highly recommend Ms. Edyta to any person filing  for an  immigration case. Trust her and you will never regret.  I was so comfortable dealing with Ms.Edyta. I am so satisfied with the result. Happy to be her client. Thank you so much and I wish you from the depth of my heart a successful career.                       IsmaImmigration in America - Law Offices of Edyta-Christina Grzybowska GrantAnn M. ratedIf you are looking for an Immigration Lawyer or Attorney to help you with your “Green Card” or “Adjustment of Status” or other related Immigrations issues, please do not hesitate to consider Edyta-Christina Grant legal services.   We highly recommended her, because we found her to be trustworthy, sincere, and helpful.  Most importantly, she displayed a high degree of professionalism and great passion for her work.  Like you, we were concerned about finding a right lawyer.  I searched and stumbled across her website and read a few reviews posted by her clients. I remember that I spoke to her on the phone for the first time as a stranger, and she patiently listened to my case.  She explained to me the process and briefly advised me what my options were.  My husband and I immediately made an appointment to see her. Edyta advised us step by step with the preparation and filing of our application for Adjustment of Status in May 2014.  We had our interview in Aug 2014.  I received the approval letter from USCIS a week after the interview, and granted a 10 years visa. We are very thankful and grateful for Edyta’s legal advice and assistance.  “Edyta, you are the Angel God sent us - not a doubt"Greene Benjamin R Law Offices Ofd.j.b. ratedGO GREENE!!!If you want a consummate professional with your best interest at heart, you gotta GO GREENE!!!After researching and going to consultations with 13 of the top lawyers in Bakersfield I choose to go with Mr. Greene to handle my family court/custody matter.  Mr. Greene was able to be the strong arm I needed to get me what I wanted for visitation with my 13 month old son.  Mr. Greene is thou rough regarding filing of papers, promptness and his ability to break down a case and reach an agreement that benefits his client best.But, not only did Mr. Greene help me with my family matter, he also became my lawyer in a criminal matter.  Mr. Greene fought to make sure I stayed out of jail and that the outcome was favorable to me.In all and all as a Masters educated African American male (with a slightly troubled background) I would suggest any and everyone to try Mr. Greene before spending thousands of dollars on an individual that May get you the same or even worse result.Mr. Greene's staff is polite, organized and pays close attention to detail in order to have Mr. Greene well prepared for your case.When I think of the law protecting our environment, I GO GREENE!!! Azemika & AzemikaDavid Z. ratedWithout a doubt the best divorce lawyer in town.  He got my case done fast and got me such great results.  I got referred to Nick Azemika by several people before I hired him.  At our first meeting, I was convinced that I was hiring the right lawyer.  He seemed so knowledgeable because he has been doing it for so long.  When we went to court, it was obvious that he has been practicing family law for years in our town.  Even the guards at the metal detectors showed him so much respect.  When the judge came out, he was talking to Nick like they have been friends for years.  He got me everything he promised me.  He was always communicating with me by email and phone whenever I would ask any questions about my case.  I just loved having Nick as my lawyer.  He made a very difficult time in my life a lot easier.  I would not hesitate in hiring him for myself again (God I hope I never need to), or refer my friends and family to him.Immigration in America - Law Offices of Edyta-Christina Grzybowska GrantZachary M. ratedAfter contacting a number of Immigration attorney’s I had the opportunity to talk with Edyta Grant.  She was the only attorney who actually provided concrete information regarding the Fiancee Visa process: pitfalls to avoid, durations of time, and what to expect during our first introductory phone conversation.  Hiring Edyta for her services is one of the best decisions one could make when embarking on this process. I am not the least surprised by the remarks and amazing thanks from so many happy couples and individuals!  Because of her, my Angel (now my wife) and I are together, Edyta helped in many ways create such a speedy turn-around for my Love’s arrival in the United States, she is there to assist you through the whole process.  Many thanks Edyta….  I would recommend Edyta to anyone in search of one the best Immigration attorney’s likely to exist in the entire West Coast.  You won’t be disappointed.Regards,Zachary Azemika & Azemikarichmidd ratedI had Nick Azemika as my divor...I had Nick Azemika as my divorce lawyer.  I had 2 other lawyers before him, who messed up my case so bad.  I hired Nick because I heard about him from several people I worked with.  The difference between him and my 2 other lawyers was like night and day.  He fixed everything the other two messed up.  I loved his personality.  He was always communicating with me.  The attorney for my kids was recommending to reduce my time with my kids because of some lies my ex wife was telling her about me.  Nick was able to get records to show they were lies.  He was so angry at the attorney for my kids that he once started shouting at her in the courtroom about how incompetent she is.  He was so angry about what was happening that you would think they were taking his kids away.  I had several people ask me in the courtroom who my attorney was.  Judges love him and his brother.  Immigration in America - Law Offices of Edyta-Christina Grzybowska GrantDylan W. ratedIf you are looking for an immigration lawyer, we highly recommend Edyta Grant. She is very professional, knowledgeable, reliable, and very friendly. She help my husband and I to prepare our application forms and gave us all the information needed to complete our evidence packet. She also made us very comfortable by explaining each step to us carefully and in great detail. Any time we had any questions, she responded to us very quickly, covering any concerns we had.

(We could never thank you enough!)Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
