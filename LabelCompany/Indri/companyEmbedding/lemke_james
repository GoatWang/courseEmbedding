Our Team






Leadership
David Johnson, President & CEO
David Johnson joined Achates Power in August 2008 as president and CEO. Johnson is leveraging his more than 25 years of industry experience to accelerate development of revolutionary internal combustion engines that provide superior fuel efficiency at lower cost and, ultimately, further the company’s goal of enabling a more sustainable future. Johnson was previously vice president of product operations for military and export markets at Navistar. As program manager for the MaxxProTM line of Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles, he delivered the vehicles in record time and record quantities for deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan to better protect U.S. soldiers. Prior to Navistar, Johnson worked for General Motors and Ford Motor Company. At GM he was program manager and chief engineer for multiple clean-diesel engine programs for Opel, Saab and Renault passenger vehicles. At Ford Motor Company Johnson led the development and launch of the SuperDuty, equipped with an all-new diesel engine. Johnson earned a Master of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Cornell University.

Dr. James Lemke, Founder and Chief Scientist
Dr. James Lemke is a serial entrepreneur with a history of founding and leading companies to successful exits and a personal passion for science, engineering and education. He founded Achates Power in 2004 with an idea that would revolutionize the automotive industry by revitalizing the opposed-piston, two-stroke engine. As an influential physicist holding more than 100 patents, Lemke understood that the rapidly increasing shortage of fuel and greater need for emissions reduction meant the world needed a solution. That solution came in a 1930s-era engine architecture that demonstrated great potential, but momentum had dissipated when the tools of the time could not produce an efficient version. Lemke knew the tools and the talent were now available to answer the transportation crisis. He started Achates Power with a collection of the brightest engineers and scientists with the condition that ideas and discourse flow unabated and the expectation that each fulfill their utmost potential. While amassing top talent in the industry, Lemke’s vision began to manifest results. However, instead of an engine that only moderately answered the need for efficiency, the Achates Power engine realized a more than 30 percent fuel efficiency improvement compared to the industry’s best diesel engines and nearly double the fuel efficiency of a standard gasoline engine at lower emissions levels and at 10 percent lower cost. While Lemke always believed in the engine’s viability, now the results have shown the industry the potential economic savings of trillions of dollars per year on fuel and components, and billions of gallons of fuel saved per year.
Prior to starting Achates Power, Lemke was the CEO and founder of Spin Physics Inc., which developed and patented magnetic recording transducers that employ unique magnetic materials instrumental to broadcast TV recording. At one time, 50 percent of the broadcast hours on television worldwide were recorded on Spin Physics’ magnetic heads. Lemke sold the company to Eastman Kodak and became a fellow of the Kodak Research Labs. Earlier in his career, Lemke was the research director of Bell and Howell Research, as well as an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego. He holds more than 100 patents with the U.S. patent office. Lemke is a member of the National Academy of Engineering as well as a fellow of both the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Lemke earned a bachelor’s degree in physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology, a master’s degree in physics from Northwestern University and a doctorate in theoretical physics from the University of California, Santa Barbara.

John Koszewnik, Chief Technical Officer
John Koszewnik joined Achates Power in June 2011 as chief technical officer. In this role, Koszewnik leverages his nearly 40 years of experience in the powertrain industry to further the development of Achates Power’s clean, efficient internal combustion engine design. He is a Member of the National Academy of Engineering. Koszewnik was previously director of production development for FEV Inc., an engineering services and consulting company, where he was responsible for ensuring that all functional requirements, quality, cost and timing of production programs were met. He also supported product development and strategic study projects for the automotive, heavy truck, locomotive and powertrain component supply industries. Prior to FEV, Koszewnik was a senior vice president at Case New Holland, an agricultural and construction equipment manufacturer, where he managed 10 engineering centers worldwide. Prior to Case New Holland, Koszewnik was at Ford Motor Co. for 30 years, most recently as director of North American Diesel. In this role, he improved quality and customer satisfaction with the power stroke diesel engine and implemented design and manufacturing strategies that resulted in significant cost savings. While at Ford, Koszewnik also was responsible for the engine engineering of all Ford’s gasoline V6, V8 and V10 engines. Koszewnik earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and a master’s degree in general management from Harvard University.

While managing the business development, government relations and marketing for Achates Power, Fromm leads engagements with leading engine, commercial vehicle and passenger vehicle manufacturers around the globe. Prior to Achates Power, Fromm served as CEO of Chaos Telecom, a venture-backed, early-stage company, where he helped create the company’s first product — licensed embedded software for digital subscriber line modems. Prior to Chaos Telecom, Fromm was the vice president of Widcomm, Inc. (sold to Broadcom Corporation), where he managed development of the Bluetooth LAN access point and developed the company’s channel program in Europe, North America and Asia. Previously, Fromm was part of the executive team at Dialogic as the company grew to $400M in annual revenue, went public and was purchased by Intel Corporation. In addition to his responsibilities with Achates Power, Fromm is a board member of NCast Inc., a company developing a webcasting Internet appliance, as well as a steering committee member of CommNexus NextStage, a nonprofit industry organization that mentors early stage companies through an entrepreneur advisory program. Fromm earned a Bachelor of Science, summa cum laude, in computer engineering from the University of Michigan and a Master of Business Administration from Harvard Business School.
