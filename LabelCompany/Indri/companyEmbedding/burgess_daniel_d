Atox Bio Announces Appointment of Biotech Veteran Daniel D. Burgess 
      as Chairman of the Board






December 15, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NESS ZIONA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Atox Bio, developer of therapeutics for severe infections, today 
      announced that it appointed biotech veteran Daniel D. Burgess as its 
      Chairman of the Board of Directors.
    


      Mr. Burgess was founder, President and CEO of Rempex Pharmaceuticals 
      Inc., an antibiotic company that was sold to the Medicines Company in a 
      transaction valued at up to $475 million. Previously, Mr. Burgess was 
      President and CEO of Mpex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a company that advanced 
      an inhaled antibiotic for cystic fibrosis into Phase 3 before it was 
      acquired by Aptalis Inc. in 2011. Mr. Burgess has also held senior 
      executive positions at a number of other biotechnology companies and 
      served as a Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of Santarus 
      Inc. until its acquisition by Salix Inc. in 2014 for $2.7 billion.
    

      Dan Burgess stated, “I am excited to work with the management team and 
      investors at Atox Bio to help bring this potentially important new 
      therapy through development. AB103 has the opportunity to benefit 
      patients in several critical care markets with significant medical need 
      and the clinical data to date is encouraging.”
    

      Dan Teleman, CEO of Atox Bio, stated, "The board and I welcome Dan 
      Burgess as our new chairman. Dan’s experience in successfully building 
      and leading anti-infective companies will greatly benefit Atox Bio as we 
      prepare for our pivotal study with AB103 in NSTI and expand into other 
      severe infections."

The Black Flag insect fogger is designed to deliver the performance and effectiveness of professional fogging systems, but for use around your home. It kills mosquitoes on contact and provides an additional 6 hours of continuous protection — ideal for use before backyard picnics, barbecues, and outdoor parties. This insect fogger disperses a 10-foot cone of insecticide, so you can fog your whole backyard in just a few minutes, and use the yard immediately afterwards.

Applies the same effective mosquito insecticide used by municipalities across the country to kill mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus.
Produces microscopic particles that deeply penetrate wooded areas and landscaping where mosquitoes hide.
Treats a ¼ acre area (over 10,000 Sq. Feet) in less than 10 minutes.
Children and pets may safely re-enter the treated area within 5 minutes of fogging.
