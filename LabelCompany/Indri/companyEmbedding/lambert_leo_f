Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z
′

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.






Main branch of the Lambert-W function in the complex plane. Note the branch cut along the negative real axis, ending at −1/e. In this picture, the hue of a point z is determined by the argument of W(z) and the brightness by the absolute value of W(z).

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for 

z

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

z

for

e
}
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

W
(
z
)


=
z

/

W
(
z
)


{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all 



z

{\displaystyle z\not =-1/e}

:

)





.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

C






=

(
W

)

W
(

)



)

+
C
.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

0


e


W
(
x
)



d


x
=
e
−
1


{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by






W

{\displaystyle W_{0}(x)=\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }{\frac {(-n)^{n-1}}{n!}}x^{n}=x-x^{2}+{\frac {3}{2}}x^{3}-{\frac {8}{3}}x^{4}+{\frac {125}{24}}x^{5}-\cdots }



The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:

{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

x

 for 

x

{\displaystyle W_{-1}(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\leq -1}



Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Applications[edit]
Many equations involving exponentials can be solved using the W function. The general strategy is to move all instances of the unknown to one side of the equation and make it look like Y = XeX at which point the W function provides the value of the variable in X.
In other words :





Y

X

e

X



⟺

X

W
(
Y

{\displaystyle Y=Xe^{X}\;\Longleftrightarrow \;X=W(Y)}

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

)

]

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]
Example 14[edit]
The equation (linked with the generating functions of Bernoulli numbers and Todd genus):

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.
See : F. Nielsen, "Jeffreys Centroids: A Closed-Form Expression for Positive Histograms and a Guaranteed Tight Approximation for Frequency Histograms"
Example 16[edit]
The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as





V
=



V

0



1
+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}








 


 


 




 





(1)





where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is 



x
=
r
+


1
c


W


(



c


e

−
c
r




a

o




)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:











e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−

r

1


)
(
x
−

r

2


)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:











e

{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}{\frac {\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-r_{i})}{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-s_{i})}}}








 


 


 




 





(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

given in Corless et al. to compute W.

Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.






Main branch of the Lambert-W function in the complex plane. Note the branch cut along the negative real axis, ending at −1/e. In this picture, the hue of a point z is determined by the argument of W(z) and the brightness by the absolute value of W(z).

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for 

z
≠

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

(

)


=

/

W
(

{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all

{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

W
(
x
)

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:





W

x

0


{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Many equations involving exponentials can be solved using the W function. The general strategy is to move all instances of the unknown to one side of the equation and make it look like Y = XeX at which point the W function provides the value of the variable in X.

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

]

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.
See : F. Nielsen, "Jeffreys Centroids: A Closed-Form Expression for Positive Histograms and a Guaranteed Tight Approximation for Frequency Histograms"
Example 16[edit]
The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as

V

0



1
+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}

where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is 



x

r

c


W


(



c


e

−
c
r




a

o




)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:











e

c
x

o


(
x

)
(
x
−

r

)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

given in Corless et al. to compute W.

Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z
′

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.






Main branch of the Lambert-W function in the complex plane. Note the branch cut along the negative real axis, ending at −1/e. In this picture, the hue of a point z is determined by the argument of W(z) and the brightness by the absolute value of W(z).

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

}
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

W
(
z
)


=
z

/

W
(
z
)


{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

W
(
x

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of 




W

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by

The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:

 for 

x

0


{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Y

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

W

x
L


)

]

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.

The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as





V

V

0

+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}








 


 


 




 





(1)





where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is

)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:

{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z
′

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.






Main branch of the Lambert-W function in the complex plane. Note the branch cut along the negative real axis, ending at −1/e. In this picture, the hue of a point z is determined by the argument of W(z) and the brightness by the absolute value of W(z).

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

}
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

W
(
z
)


=
z

/

W
(

)


{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

(

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of 




W

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by

The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:

{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

x


)

x

 for 

x

{\displaystyle W_{-1}(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\leq -1}



Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Applications[edit]
Many equations involving exponentials can be solved using the W function. The general strategy is to move all instances of the unknown to one side of the equation and make it look like Y = XeX at which point the W function provides the value of the variable in X.
In other words :





Y

X

e

X



⟺

X

W
(
Y

{\displaystyle Y=Xe^{X}\;\Longleftrightarrow \;X=W(Y)}

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.
See : F. Nielsen, "Jeffreys Centroids: A Closed-Form Expression for Positive Histograms and a Guaranteed Tight Approximation for Frequency Histograms"
Example 16[edit]
The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as

V

1
+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}








 


 


 




 





(1)





where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is 



x

W


(



c


e

−
c
r




a

o




)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:











e

)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}{\frac {\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-r_{i})}{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-s_{i})}}}








 


 


 




 





(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z
′

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for 

z
≠

1

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

z

for

}
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

W
(
z
)


=
z

/

W
(
z
)


{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

W

)

C
.






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

0

W
(
x
)

−

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of 




W

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by

The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:





W

x

0


{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Many equations involving exponentials can be solved using the W function. The general strategy is to move all instances of the unknown to one side of the equation and make it look like Y = XeX at which point the W function provides the value of the variable in X.

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

]

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.
See : F. Nielsen, "Jeffreys Centroids: A Closed-Form Expression for Positive Histograms and a Guaranteed Tight Approximation for Frequency Histograms"
Example 16[edit]
The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as

V

0



1
+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}

where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is 



x

r

c


W


(



c


e

−
c
r




a

o




)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:











e

c
x

o


(
x

)
(
x
−

r

)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

given in Corless et al. to compute W.

Lambert W function - Wikipedia






















 






Lambert W function

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





The graph of W(x) for W > −4 and x < 6. The upper branch with W ≥ −1 is the function W0 (principal branch), the lower branch with W ≤ −1 is the function W−1.


In mathematics, the Lambert-W function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a set of functions, namely the branches of the inverse relation of the function f(z) = zez where ez is the exponential function and z is any complex number. In other words





z
=

f

−
1


(
z

e

z


)
=
W
(
z

e

z


)


{\displaystyle z=f^{-1}(ze^{z})=W(ze^{z})}



By substituting the above equation in 




z
′

=
z

e

z




{\displaystyle z'=ze^{z}}

, we get the defining equation for the W function (and for the W relation in general):






z
′

=
W
(

z
′

)

e

W
(

z
′

)




{\displaystyle z'=W(z')e^{W(z')}}



for any complex number z'.
Since the function ƒ is not injective, the relation W is multivalued (except at 0). If we restrict attention to real-valued W, the complex variable z is then replaced by the real variable x, and the relation is defined only for x ≥ −1/e, and is double-valued on (−1/e, 0). The additional constraint W ≥ −1 defines a single-valued function W0(x). We have W0(0) = 0 and W0(−1/e) = −1. Meanwhile, the lower branch has W ≤ −1 and is denoted W−1(x). It decreases from W−1(−1/e) = −1 to W−1(0−) = −∞.
The Lambert W relation cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.[1] It is useful in combinatorics, for instance in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as y'(t) = a y(t − 1). In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, a closed-form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert W function.






Main branch of the Lambert-W function in the complex plane. Note the branch cut along the negative real axis, ending at −1/e. In this picture, the hue of a point z is determined by the argument of W(z) and the brightness by the absolute value of W(z).

Terminology[edit]




The two main branches 




W

0




{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 and 




W

−
1




{\displaystyle W_{-1}}




The Lambert-W function is named after Johann Heinrich Lambert. The main branch W0 is denoted by Wp in the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions and the branch W−1 is denoted by Wm there.
The notation convention chosen here (with W0 and W−1) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert-W function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.[2]
History[edit]
Lambert first considered the related Lambert's Transcendental Equation in 1758,[3] which led to a paper by Leonhard Euler in 1783[4] that discussed the special case of wew.
The Lambert W function was "re-discovered" every decade or so in specialized applications.[citation needed] In 1993, when it was reported that the Lambert W function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics—Corless and developers of the Maple Computer algebra system made a library search, and found that this function was ubiquitous in nature.[2][5]
Calculus[edit]
Derivative[edit]
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of W satisfy the differential equation

for

/

e
.


{\displaystyle z(1+W){\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}=W\quad {\text{for }}z\neq -1/e.}



(W is not differentiable for z = −1/e.) As a consequence, we get the following formula for the derivative of W:










d


W

}
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {W(z)}{z(1+W(z))}}\quad {\text{for }}z\not \in \{0,-1/e\}.}



Using the identity 




e

W
(
z
)


=
z

/

W
(
z
)


{\displaystyle e^{W(z)}=z/W(z)}

, we get the following equivalent formula which holds for all

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {{\rm {d}}W}{{\rm {d}}z}}={\frac {1}{z+e^{W(z)}}}.}



Antiderivative[edit]
The function W(x), and many expressions involving W(x), can be integrated using the substitution w = W(x), i.e. x = w ew:









∫
W
(
x
)



d


x



=

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\int W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x&=xW(x)-x+e^{W(x)}+C\\&=x\left(W(x)-1+{\frac {1}{W(x)}}\right)+C.\\\end{aligned}}}



(The last equation is more common in the literature but does not hold at 



x
=
0


{\displaystyle x=0}

.)
One consequence of which (using the fact that 



W
(
e
)
=
1


{\displaystyle W(e)=1}

) is the identity:






∫

W
(
x

{\displaystyle \int _{0}^{e}W(x)\,{\rm {d}}x=e-1}



Asymptotic expansions[edit]
The Taylor series of 




W

{\displaystyle W_{0}}

 around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by

The radius of convergence is 1/e, as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval (−∞, −1/e]; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert W function.
For large values of x, W0 is asymptotic to

Identities[edit]
A few identities follow from definition:

 for 

x

0


{\displaystyle W(x\cdot e^{x})=x{\text{ for }}x\geq 0}

Note that, since f(x) = x⋅ex is not injective, not always W(f(x)) = x. For fixed x < 0 and x ≠ -1 the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey has two solutions in y, one of which is of course y = x. Then, for i = 0 and x < −1 as well as for i = −1 and x ∈ (−1, 0), Wi(x⋅ex) is the other solution of the equation x⋅ex = y⋅ey.

Special values[edit]
For any non-zero algebraic number x, W(x) is a transcendental number. Indeed, if W(x) is zero then x must be zero as well, and if W(x) is non-zero and algebraic, then by the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, eW(x) must be transcendental, implying that x=W(x)eW(x) must also be transcendental.

Y

Example 8[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been recently (2013) shown to be the optimal solution for the required magnetic field of a Zeeman slower.[12]
Example 9[edit]
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in the laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:

W

x
L


)

]

,


{\displaystyle H(x)=1+W\left[(H(0)-1)\exp \left((H(0)-1)-{\frac {x}{L}}\right)\right],}



where H(x) is the debris flow height, x is the channel downstream position, L is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.
Example 10[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal.[13]
Example 11[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of Chemical Engineering for modelling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert "W" function turned out to be the exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.[14][15]
Example 12[edit]
The Lambert-W function was employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert "W" for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert "W" turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.[16]
Example 13[edit]
The Lambert-W function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneus tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the -1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the ligther fluid.[17]

This application shows in evidence that the branch difference of the W function can be employed in order to solve other trascendental equations.
See : D. J. Jeffrey and J. E. Jankowski, "Branch differences and Lambert W"
Example 15[edit]
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence) is in closed form using the Lambert function.

The Lambert-W function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential (see The Lambert-W step-potential) which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as





V
=



V

0



1
+
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)





{\displaystyle V={\frac {V_{0}}{1+W(e^{-x/\sigma })}}}

.

A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to 



z
=
W
(

e

−
x

/

σ


)


{\displaystyle z=W(e^{-x/\sigma })}

.
See : A.M. Ishkhanyan, "The Lambert W-barrier – an exactly solvable confluent hypergeometric potential"
Generalizations[edit]
The standard Lambert-W function expresses exact solutions to transcendental algebraic equations (in x) of the form:










e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−
r
)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r)}








 


 


 




 





(1)





where a0, c and r are real constants. The solution is 



x

r

c


W


(



c


e

−
c
r




a

o




)




{\displaystyle x=r+{\frac {1}{c}}W\!\left({\frac {c\,e^{-cr}}{a_{o}}}\right)\,}

. Generalizations of the Lambert W function[18][19][20] include:

An application to general relativity and quantum mechanics (quantum gravity) in lower dimensions, in fact a previously unknown link (unknown prior to[21]) between these two areas, where the right-hand-side of (1) is now a quadratic polynomial in x:











e

−
c
x


=

a

o


(
x
−

r

)
(
x
−

r

2


)


{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}(x-r_{1})(x-r_{2})}








 


 


 




 





(2)






and where r1 and r2 are real distinct constants, the roots of the quadratic polynomial. Here, the solution is a function has a single argument x but the terms like ri and ao are parameters of that function. In this respect, the generalization resembles the hypergeometric function and the Meijer G-function but it belongs to a different class of functions. When r1 = r2, both sides of (2) can be factored and reduced to (1) and thus the solution reduces to that of the standard W function. Eq. (2) expresses the equation governing the dilaton field, from which is derived the metric of the R=T or lineal two-body gravity problem in 1+1 dimensions (one spatial dimension and one time dimension) for the case of unequal (rest) masses, as well as, the eigenenergies of the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for unequal charges in one dimension.


Analytical solutions of the eigenenergies of a special case of the quantum mechanical three-body problem, namely the (three-dimensional) hydrogen molecule-ion.[22] Here the right-hand-side of (1) (or (2)) is now a ratio of infinite order polynomials in x:

{\displaystyle e^{-cx}=a_{o}{\frac {\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-r_{i})}{\displaystyle \prod _{i=1}^{\infty }(x-s_{i})}}}








 


 


 




 





(3)






where ri and si are distinct real constants and x is a function of the eigenenergy and the internuclear distance R. Eq. (3) with its specialized cases expressed in (1) and (2) is related to a large class of delay differential equations. Hardy's notion of a "false derivative" provides exact multiple roots to special cases of (3).[23]

Applications of the Lambert "W" function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in (1) as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.[24]

Numerical evaluation[edit]
The W function may be approximated using Newton's method, with successive approximations to 



w

z
)


{\displaystyle w=W(z)}

 (so

e

{\displaystyle z=we^{w}}

{\displaystyle w_{j+1}=w_{j}-{\frac {w_{j}e^{w_{j}}-z}{e^{w_{j}}+w_{j}e^{w_{j}}}}.}

given in Corless et al. to compute W.
Software[edit]
The Lambert-W function is implemented as LambertW in Maple, lambertw in GP (and glambertW in PARI), lambertw in MATLAB,[25] also lambertw in octave with the 'specfun' package, as lambert_w in Maxima,[26] as ProductLog (with a silent alias LambertW) in Mathematica,[27] as lambertw in Python scipy's special function package,[28] as LambertW in Perl's ntheory module,[29] and as gsl_sf_lambert_W0 and gsl_sf_lambert_Wm1 functions in special functions section of the GNU Scientific Library – GSL.
A C++ code for all the branches of the complex Lambert W function is available on the homepage of István Mező.[30]
