Our Investment Process
















CWI 1's Performance 









T-

reset font size






CWI 1 has established and continues to build what we believe is a diversified, well-performing portfolio of hotels. Its portfolio is comprised of a mix of select and full-service hotels and resorts, representing both current income and growth-oriented properties across the U.S.
During the first quarter of 2017, CWI 1's portfolio has outperformed the U.S. Lodging Industry as a whole:

 
1 Occupancy is the percentage of rooms sold divided by rooms available.
2 ADR, or average daily rate, is room revenue divided by rooms sold, displayed as the average rental rate for a single room.
3 RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is room revenue divided by available rooms.
4 STR, Inc., April 2017. (Date for the nine months ended 03/31/17)
5 Represents statistical data for our Consolidated Hotels during our ownership period.


For the first quarter 2017.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
Although we expect lodging fundamentals to continue to improve, there can be no assurance as to the extent or duration of the improvement.

Risk Factors: 
This investment contains a high degree of risk, which is detailed in the Risk Factors section of the Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (CWI 2) prospectus. You should consider all of the risks described in the prospectus before you decide to purchase our securities, including the following:

There is no public market for our shares; a public market is unlikely ever to develop and we are not required ever to provide you with liquidity for your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before we complete a liquidity event, you will likely receive less than your purchase price.

We have a limited operating history and you will be unable to evaluate our complete investment portfolio prior to your investment.

Our advisor and the sub advisor will be paid substantial fees based on factors other than the quality of services provided, which may encourage them to use increased leverage or to make riskier investments. Our agreements with our advisor, the sub advisor and Carey Financial, LLC, the dealer manager, are not arm’s length agreements.

We will be subject to the risks of operating lodging properties and the lodging industry generally. Failure of lodging industry fundamentals to continue to improve may adversely affect our business strategy.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and ability to make distributions. 

The payment of distributions is subject to the Board of Directors and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future distributions. Distributions are not guaranteed. Our distribution coverage using FFO was approximately 19% of total distributions for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and on a cumulative basis through that date with the balance funded with proceeds from our offering. Our distributions will likely exceed earnings before we have substantially invested the net proceeds of the public offering and may be paid without limit from offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets, which could reduce your overall return.

We may change our investment policies, including our targeted class of investments, without stockholder notice or approval, which could change the nature of your investment and adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objectives.

As a new investor, you will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of your shares equal to your shares’ proportionate share of the costs of the offering.

Shares of our common stock are subject to a 9.8% ownership limitation that is intended, among other purposes, to assist us in complying with restrictions imposed on REITs by the Internal Revenue Code.

Research may not reflect all views or studies of the past and prospective performance of the lodging industry. The information presented in this website may be known by others including existing and potential competitors, and competitive factors may diminish issuer returns.


Not FDIC or NCUA/NCUSIF insured, not bank or credit union guaranteed and may lose value.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
