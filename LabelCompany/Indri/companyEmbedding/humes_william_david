Letters of David Hume to William Strahan, Benjamin Franklin's Lifelong Friend (Illustrated and Bundled with Autobiography by David Hume










Letters of David Hume to William Strahan, Benjamin Franklin's Lifelong Friend (Illustrated and Bundled with Autobiography by David Hume


The book has an active table of contents for easy access to each chapter of the following titles:1.	Letters of David Hume to William Strahan – David Hume2.	My Own Life – David HumeDavid Hume was a Scottish historian, philosopher, and economist in the row with the greatest thinkers Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, John Keynes, John Locke, and Alfred Marshall.  Their thoughts had strong influence on building the foundation of the United States and its endeavor of open society. William Strahan was born in April 1715 in Edinburgh, Scotland and became the primary publisher of author Samuel Johnson's influential A Dictionary of the English Language. He was the publisher and owner of both the London Chronicle and Public Advertiser.Strahan was also politically active and joined Parliament as a representative for over a decade until 1780s. He wrote extensively about Parliamentary debates, and became acquainted with Benjamin Franklin. Strahan and Franklin maintained a lifelong friendship. David Hume in this book gave a free discussion across the important subjects of philosophy, the history of England, printing, relationship with Rousseau, the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, and the others. Hume’s works also produced great influence on utilitarianism, logical positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, and cognitive philosophy. Without any doubt, Hume’s thoughts to the world also had the deep impact on the Founding Fathers of the United States.David Hume’ influence has been felt in nearly every field of the humanities and social sciences. The reasoning by David Hume still remains as relevant today as it was then.   This book is one of the most important ones about the deepest thoughts of political economics, philosophy, the history of England, and many historical events by David Hume, one of the greatest thinkers of modern economics and logic on the planet.

Hume advocated a compatibilist theory of free will that proved extremely influential on subsequent moral philosophy. He was also a sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on feelings rather than abstract moral principles. Hume also examined the normative is–ought problem. He held notoriously ambiguous views of Christianity, but famously challenged the argument from design in his Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1777).
Kant credited Hume with waking him up from his "dogmatic slumbers" and Hume has proved extremely influential on subsequent philosophy, especially on utilitarianism, logical positivism, William James, philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy, cognitive philosophy, and other movements and thinkers. The philosopher Jerry Fodor proclaimed Hume's Treatise "the founding document of cognitive science"

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

William David Homes
























Creative Luxury.

It is impossible to walk through a William David home and not feel where “creative luxury” came from.  Every detail and feature we expect in a luxury home is there but the unforgettable creativity in design at every turn will impress.  Creativity is a collective process and its necessary to build a truly eye catching home.



Built for You.
No two homes are the same.
This is your chance to turn a blank slate into something beautiful, meaningful and lasting. We don't take that for granted. Our buildings are not merely houses, but homes lived in and loved in, designed and built around the specific needs of each family. Literally starting from the ground up, it takes an experienced team that cares about the work we put out each day.
Collectively, we have 60 years in the industry, taking lessons we've learned along the way and applying them to your home build. Those lessons have helped us hone a process that ensures effective communication from the initial meeting to the final walk-through. You can learn more about that process in detail here.

Communities.
Home is where the heart is.

Community is one of the most important things to complete a luxury home. William David partners with the best in Texas to ensure your family has the greatest opportunity for community. 
Our Communities:

Building Something Real.
Our work.
We understand a home is something we're privileged to build alongside our clients, not just for them. Using each family as a muse for each home ensures our creativity is working at maximum capacity. After all, it's in the details that a house becomes a home. Take a look at some of our work, and ultimately the people whose lives have been impacted from it.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Excerpt from David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human UndersExcerpt from David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human UnderstandingA Primary Resource Analysis by Solana Del Bel BelluzThe ArgumentThrough human reason and experience, it can be said that miracles are impossible, unless the falsehood of the testimony is the greater miracle.miracles are a violation of the laws of nature(1)if any seemingly miraculous event has even once occurred in the natural world, then it is not a miracle(2)ex. a healthy man suddenly dying no such testimony (that proves a miracle) has ever actually occurred in history(3)Context and ImpactHume is one of the first truly radical skepticists of the Enlightenment movement(4)his ideas are unique, but are somewhat of a continuation of the work of past philosophersHume's work inspired many other philosophers of the day and of later yearsIssues of the TimeWays of Reasoning: Induction, deduction, empiricism, rationalism, scepticismundermining the tyranny of the Church and the monarchyrights and freedoms of man, debate between democracy and monarchy corruption of society and natural innocence vs. naturally corrupt and "evil" humanityreligious tolerancesome feminismInfluences on David Hume:Scottish, 37 when "An Enquiry..." was published(6)Calvinist mother(7)other thinkers of the Enlightenment movement predecessors John Locke and George Berkeley(8)living in a harsh class systemCredibilityHume wrote "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" to elaborate and clarify an earlier, not so well received work called "A Treatise of Human Nature".(9) He may have been more excessive in his radical skepticism to create more of a "buzz". Both works were published anonymously and intended for the public. He may also have somewhat simplified his prose to make it accessible to the public. Conclusions and ConnectionsHume's chapter on miracles reflects the more skeptical side of the Enlightenment thinking, but does well represent the support of individual thought and reasoning in the thinkers of the dayThis source betters our understanding of the Age of Enlightenment by showing the diversion of thinkers already within such a unique group. While one Enlightened thinker deeply supports Absolute Monarchy, another can be desperately working towards a Republic. While one thinker is practically an atheist, another insists on our need for God in order have morality. However this difference of opinions reflects the shared beliefs of all Enlightened thinkers, that each man has a right to his own beliefs and must come to his own conclusions based on a well backed-up system of reasoning.(all taken from class power point, course content)Notes1.
