Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research

•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation

So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

                      Determined to tackle important problems with technology, creativity and ingenuity, three Oregon state College graduates -
                      Holly Cornell, Jim Howland, and Burke Hayes - joined up with their enthusiastic civil engineering professor, Fred Merryfield,
                      to found CH2M in Corvallis, Oregon. Their educations and their service during World War II had taught them the value of honesty,
                      integrity, hard work and giving back to their communities. These principles guided their new company from the start.
                    
                      Exactly when or why is a mystery, but at some point early on, the name of the firm evolved from "Cornell, Howland, Hayes & Merryfield"
                      to a shorter version based on the founders' initials: CH2M.
                    1958 Roots of the Applied Sciences Laboratory
                      The drive to create new solutions for hard challenges led CH2M to open our own materials testing laboratory in the
                      carport of the Corvallis engineering office. What started in that carport is now the CH2M Applied Sciences Laboratory
                      (ASL), an internationally accredited environmental testing and treatability research center with a staff of more than
                      30 chemists, biologists, scientists and support personnel.
                    
                      ASL gives us expert real-world analytical, applied research and consulting help for CH2M projects all over the world,
                      and it provides testing and research services directly to public and private clients.
                    1965 Lake Tahoe opens world's first full-scale, advanced wastewater treatment facility
                      CH2M was called in to help when the South Lake Tahoe (California, U.S.) Public Utility's wastewater treatment system
                      couldn't keep up with population growth. Using a range of technology and process innovations we developed, CH2M helped
                      Lake Tahoe design and build the world's first treatment system designed to clean wastewater to near drinking water standards.
                    
                      This pioneering project became a model for many tertiary advanced wastewater treatment facilities that followed all around the world.
                    1980  OMI Founded
                      As our partnerships with water and wastewater clients expanded, we saw that they needed help operating and maintaining their systems.
                      To meet that need, we created Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI). The business expanded quickly, providing public works
                      and facilities management to local governments and private-sector clients.
                    
                      Now a fully integrated part of the CH2M family with over 2,500 experienced team members, the operations management group partners with
                      more than 200 clients around the world managing facilities and consulting on asset management, facility optimization and workforce
                      development to drive business results.
                    1991 CH2M Foundation established
                      We launched the CH2M Foundation to honor the firm's four founders and their dedication to the well-being of people and communities.
                      In its first decade, the Foundation invested more than USD $2 million in college and university programs in support of science, technology,
                      engineering and math (STEM) education.
                    
                      In 2013, the Foundation got a reboot with a fresh, relevant mission to promote sustainable communities and CH2M volunteer efforts,
                      along with STEM education. Over the next year, the Foundation doubled its giving, expanded its reach further around the world
                      and developed new opportunities for our employees to volunteer their skills and creativity to build lasting, life-sustaining
                      infrastructure in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
                    1995 Rocky Flats cleanup begins
                      As the managing partner of Kaiser-Hill, LLC, we were awarded the opportunity to decommission a vast former nuclear weapons plant
                      in Rocky Flats, Colorado, U.S. - no one had ever dismantled a nuclear facility like this before.
                    
                      Over the next ten years, we pioneered a series of methods and processes to clean up and dispose of more than 20 metric tons of
                      fissile and nuclear materials, as well as more than 800 contaminated buildings. We finished over a decade ahead of schedule and 
                      billions of dollars under the initial cost estimates, but the end result was even better: most of Rocky Flats is now a wildlife refuge.
                    
                      The lessons we learned at Rocky Flats formed the basis of our global nuclear business and cemented our reputation for excellence in 
                      complex program management.
                    2005 Sustainability reporting and EMS established
                      Environmental engineering and stewardship has been central to our work since we began, but in 2005, we made our commitment stronger.
                      CH2M was the first company in our industry to create an Environmental Management System (EMS) that follows ISO 14001 guidelines and
                      among the first to publish a Sustainability Report, both in 2005.
                    
                      The EMS is a big part of how we live our promise. It encompasses people, procedures and work practices to improve our environmental
                      performance. Our teammates evaluate our progress against measurable goals and drive continual improvement. We report on our performance
                      in our annual Sustainability Report and publishing it is one part of our participation in the United Nations Global Compact.

East Devon District Council Selects CH2M to Develop a Beach Management Plan for the Coastline from Seaton Hole to Axmouth Harbour, England
Jul 19 17
Looking to strengthen the Seaton seafront against coastal flooding and erosion, East Devon District Council selected CH2M to develop a beach management plan (BMP) for the coastline from Seaton Hole to Axmouth Harbour, England. CH2M will work alongside East Devon, experts from the Environment Agency and Natural England and various local community groups to identify management practices and solutions to protect the region's properties and assets from flooding and erosion for the next 20-30 years. Split into six stages, the project efforts will include: Gathering early stakeholder input to raise awareness of the project and capture local knowledge; Conducting site visits and collecting data to get familiar with the location and discuss existing coastline issues; Establishing baselines to develop a robust knowledge and evidence base of coastal processes, defence condition/performance, socioenvironmental setting and economic justification, as well as uncertainty, to underpin future management decisions; Reviewing current management practices against baselines to assess future solutions; Identifying future options to manage coastal flood and erosion risks via a clear and transparent process that considers sustainability; performance; buildability, public safety and amenity uses; implications for adjacent coastlines; and future monitoring and modelling needs; Developing a BMP document and action plan that sets out management actions, responsibilities and timings, so the plan can be readily used for ongoing coastal resilience for the next five years and beyond.

It's a cornerstone of our business.#3SustainabilityMeeting the infrastructure and natural resource needs of a growing world while balancing economic, social and environmental priorities.History highlights1946CH2M Founded1946 CH2M Founded
                      Determined to tackle important problems with technology, creativity and ingenuity, three Oregon state College graduates -
                      Holly Cornell, Jim Howland, and Burke Hayes - joined up with their enthusiastic civil engineering professor, Fred Merryfield,
                      to found CH2M in Corvallis, Oregon. Their educations and their service during World War II had taught them the value of honesty,
                      integrity, hard work and giving back to their communities. These principles guided their new company from the start.
                    
                      Exactly when or why is a mystery, but at some point early on, the name of the firm evolved from "Cornell, Howland, Hayes & Merryfield"
                      to a shorter version based on the founders' initials: CH2M.
                    1958 Roots of the Applied Sciences Laboratory
                      The drive to create new solutions for hard challenges led CH2M to open our own materials testing laboratory in the
                      carport of the Corvallis engineering office. What started in that carport is now the CH2M Applied Sciences Laboratory
                      (ASL), an internationally accredited environmental testing and treatability research center with a staff of more than
                      30 chemists, biologists, scientists and support personnel.
                    
                      ASL gives us expert real-world analytical, applied research and consulting help for CH2M projects all over the world,
                      and it provides testing and research services directly to public and private clients.
                    1965 Lake Tahoe opens world's first full-scale, advanced wastewater treatment facility
                      CH2M was called in to help when the South Lake Tahoe (California, U.S.) Public Utility's wastewater treatment system
                      couldn't keep up with population growth. Using a range of technology and process innovations we developed, CH2M helped
                      Lake Tahoe design and build the world's first treatment system designed to clean wastewater to near drinking water standards.
                    
                      This pioneering project became a model for many tertiary advanced wastewater treatment facilities that followed all around the world.
                    1980  OMI Founded
                      As our partnerships with water and wastewater clients expanded, we saw that they needed help operating and maintaining their systems.
                      To meet that need, we created Operations Management International, Inc. (OMI). The business expanded quickly, providing public works
                      and facilities management to local governments and private-sector clients.
                    
                      Now a fully integrated part of the CH2M family with over 2,500 experienced team members, the operations management group partners with
                      more than 200 clients around the world managing facilities and consulting on asset management, facility optimization and workforce
                      development to drive business results.
                    1991 CH2M Foundation established
                      We launched the CH2M Foundation to honor the firm's four founders and their dedication to the well-being of people and communities.
                      In its first decade, the Foundation invested more than USD $2 million in college and university programs in support of science, technology,
                      engineering and math (STEM) education.
                    
                      In 2013, the Foundation got a reboot with a fresh, relevant mission to promote sustainable communities and CH2M volunteer efforts,
                      along with STEM education. Over the next year, the Foundation doubled its giving, expanded its reach further around the world
                      and developed new opportunities for our employees to volunteer their skills and creativity to build lasting, life-sustaining
                      infrastructure in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
                    1995 Rocky Flats cleanup begins
                      As the managing partner of Kaiser-Hill, LLC, we were awarded the opportunity to decommission a vast former nuclear weapons plant
                      in Rocky Flats, Colorado, U.S. - no one had ever dismantled a nuclear facility like this before.
                    
                      Over the next ten years, we pioneered a series of methods and processes to clean up and dispose of more than 20 metric tons of
                      fissile and nuclear materials, as well as more than 800 contaminated buildings. We finished over a decade ahead of schedule and 
                      billions of dollars under the initial cost estimates, but the end result was even better: most of Rocky Flats is now a wildlife refuge.
                    
                      The lessons we learned at Rocky Flats formed the basis of our global nuclear business and cemented our reputation for excellence in 
                      complex program management.
                    2005 Sustainability reporting and EMS established
                      Environmental engineering and stewardship has been central to our work since we began, but in 2005, we made our commitment stronger.
                      CH2M was the first company in our industry to create an Environmental Management System (EMS) that follows ISO 14001 guidelines and
                      among the first to publish a Sustainability Report, both in 2005.
                    
                      The EMS is a big part of how we live our promise. It encompasses people, procedures and work practices to improve our environmental
                      performance. Our teammates evaluate our progress against measurable goals and drive continual improvement. We report on our performance
                      in our annual Sustainability Report and publishing it is one part of our participation in the United Nations Global Compact.

CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]

The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

History[edit]
CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]

The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

History[edit]
CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]

The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

History[edit]
CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]




CH2M Hill offices at the Parkside Tower in Salt Lake City, Utah






The former VECO building, now CH2M Hill's Alaska headquarters


The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

History[edit]
CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]

The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

History[edit]
CH2M was founded in 1946 in Corvallis, Oregon by Oregon State University civil engineering professor Fred Merryfield and three of his students: Holly Cornell, James Howland and Thomas Burke Hayes (the firm was named after the founders, with Howland and Hayes making up the H2 portion).[5] Cornell, Howland, and Hayes were all graduates of Oregon State University.[6] The company became CH2M Hill name after a 1971 merger with Clair A. Hill and Associates of Redding, California.[7] The firm remained headquartered in Oregon until 1980, when a decision was made to relocate to Colorado, a more central location in the United States.
Services[edit]

The company operates in multiple business units,[8] among the operating divisions, Water, Energy & Facilities; Government, Environment & Infrastructure; and International. Business groups served include: Water; Transportation; Operations and Maintenance; Government Facilities and Infrastructure; Nuclear; Environmental; Energy and Chemicals; Power; and Industrial and Advanced Technology.
The company developed, maintains and publishes its own method for managing projects for clients, called the CH2M Hill Project Delivery System, which may be found at popular internet book retailers.[9] As a firm specializing in project management, CH2M Hill has been associated in several large, complex projects around the world. In 2005, a CH2M Hill joint-venture known as Kaiser-Hill decommissioned and closed a former nuclear weapons facility at the Rocky Flats site in Colorado (former Rocky Flats Plant).
In Singapore, the company was part of a joint venture to replace the country's sanitary services infrastructure.[10] The new Singapore Deep Tunnel System was designed to improve reliability, ease, and economy of operation, and to help handle Singapore's increasing waterfront utilization.[11] CH2M Hill assisted in reconstruction efforts along the US Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.[12] Its main assignments included providing temporary housing, debris removal, and other services.
Other large projects include a $660 million gas-fired power plant in Australia, in conjunction with General Electric,[13] and an $11.7 billion project to relocate American military bases in Korea.[14] In August 2007, the Panama Canal Authority selected CH2M Hill to manage the $5.25 billion Panama Canal expansion project, which will add new locks to the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal and allow Post Panamax ships passage through the canal for the first time.[15] In 2009, a CH2M Hill consortium was named program partner to oversee construction of the Crossrail[16] project to expand London’s transit system.
On August 30, 2006, as part of joint venture CLM, CH2M Hill was a supplier for the London 2012 Olympics.[17] The other two members of the venture are project management service provider Mace Group and Laing O'Rourke, the largest privately owned construction firm in the UK.
The company manages projects for the clients, taking into account the environmental footprint, aiming to use sustainable technology. The firm reduced its own internal environmental footprint in 2011.[18]
In 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) contracted a CH2M Hill company, CH2M Hill Plateau Remediation Company, LLC (CHPRC), to manage deconstruction and remediation of the Central Plateau on the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington, one of the world’s largest environmental cleanup projects. The project focused on shrinking the environmental footprint of the Hanford Site from a 586-square-mile (1,520 km2) area (large enough to fit the city of Los Angeles) to 75 square miles (190 km2) or less. More importantly, the project will reduce legacy infrastructure costs on site by more than $25 million per year starting in 2015. Using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funding, CHPRC sped up cleanup of the site over two years, reducing the site footprint 25 percent, employing an additional 1,350 people in the process.[citation needed] When ARRA funded work concludes in September 2012, the site footprint was targeted to shrink to a total of 290 square miles (750 km2), roughly half its previous size. Without ARRA funding, however, the scope of DOE contracted work at Hanford will be reduced. The company also announced that its workforce would reduce by up to 1,350 workers later that year through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations.[citation needed]
In February 2012, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee appointed the company to manage the delivery of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.[19]
CH2M HILL are the developers of Flood Modeller Pro, an industry-leading flood risk modelling and real-time flood forecasting suite of software.
Acquisitions[edit]
Key acquisitions include Black, Crow & Eidsness (a southeast U.S. engineering firm) in 1977,[20] Gore & Storrie (a Canadian water and wastewater engineering firm) in 1995,[21] Gee & Jensen (a Florida-based Ports and Harbor firm) in 2002,[22] DeMil International (a U.S.-based weapons destruction firm) in 2002,[23] EHS Consultants Ltd (a Hong Kong-based consulting firm),[24] Lockwood Greene, the oldest continuously operating professional services firm in the United States in 2003,[25] and BBS Corporation (an Ohio-based environmental engineering firm) in 2005.[26] On September 7, 2007, CH2M HILL finalized the purchase of most of the components of VECO, an Alaska-based firm specializing in services to the oil, gas, and energy sector that had become embroiled in the Alaska political corruption probe.[27] In December 2007, CH2M Hill acquired Trigon EPC.[28] In March 2008, CH2M Hill acquired Texas-based Goldston Engineering, a company specializing in marine and coastal transportation engineering services.[29] In July 2011, CH2M Hill finalized the acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton’s State & Local Government Transportation Consulting (S&L Transportation) business. In September 2011, CH2M Hill announced that it intended to acquire the share capital of Halcrow Group Limited, a UK-based engineering consultancy that operates worldwide.[30] The acquisition for £124m was completed on November 10, 2011.[31] In 2014, CH2M Hill acquired TERA Environmental Consultants of Calgary, Alberta.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
