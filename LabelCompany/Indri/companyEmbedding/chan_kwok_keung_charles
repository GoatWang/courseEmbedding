Item 4.Purpose of Transaction

On April 23, 2015, via Success Securities
Limited, Dr. Chan acquired a total of 229,962,089 shares of ITC (the issued shares of ITC are hereinafter referred to as “ITC

The Rights Offering by the Issuer
 
On March 23, 2015, the Issuer announced
that it would issue to the holders of the outstanding Shares of the Issuer as at the close of business (Toronto Time) on April
2, 2015 (the “Record Date”) an aggregate of 34,144,969 transferable rights (the “Rights”) to subscribe
for 1,552,044 Shares in the capital of the Issuer (the “Rights Offering”).
 
Each registered holder of Shares as of
the Record Date received one right for each Share held as of the Record Date. Every 22 Rights entitled the holder thereof to purchase
one Share (the “Basic Subscription Privilege”) at a price of CAD 2.26 per Share. ITC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries,
Large Scale and Great Intelligence Limited (“Great Intelligence”), exercised their Basic Subscription Privileges and
applied for their respective pro rata amounts of 231,358 Shares and 86,470 Shares. In addition, Large Scale and Great Intelligence
made additional subscriptions under the Rights Offering for 564,892 Shares and 211,130 Shares, respectively.
 

 
 

 
The Rights Offering was completed on April
30, 2015 in connection with which Large Scale and Great Intelligence received 265,667 Shares and 99,293 Shares, respectively.
 
In connection with the Rights Offering,
ITC, E-Concept Ltd. (“E-Concept”) and I-Global Ltd. (“I-Global”) entered into a standby commitment agreement
(the “Standby Commitment Agreement”) with the Issuer on March 23, 2015. Pursuant to the Standby Commitment Agreement,
ITC, E-Concept and I-Global agreed to purchase from the Issuer such number of Shares that were available for purchase, but not
otherwise subscribed for, that would result in 1,552,044 Shares being issued under the Rights Offering (the “Standby Commitment”).
The Standby Commitment of each of ITC, E-Concept and I-Global was subject to a maximum of 793,715, 416,879 and 341,450 Shares,
respectively. ITC, E-Concept and I-Global were therefore obligated to purchase up to a maximum of 1,552,044 Shares in the aggregate,
being the maximum number of Shares that could be issued pursuant to the Rights Offering. The Standby Commitment lapsed upon completion
of the Rights Offering on April 30, 2015.
 
As compensation for the Standby Commitment,
each of ITC (or its nominee), E-Concept and I-Global received non-transferrable Share purchase warrants (the “Standby Warrants”)
entitling ITC (or its nominee) to acquire up to 198,429 Shares, E-Concept to acquire up to 104,220 Shares and I-Global to acquire
up to 85,362 Shares. The exercise price of the Standby Warrants is CAD 2.26 per Share. The Standby Warrants must be exercised on
or before April 30, 2017. Large Scale, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ITC, is named as the holder of the aforesaid 198,429 Standby
Warrants.
 
The exercisability of the Standby Warrants
was conditional upon the receipt of the approval of the Issuer’s shareholders, which was obtained on September 3, 2015. Accordingly,
Large Scale is entitled to exercise the aforesaid 198,429 Standby Warrants at any time through April 30, 2017.
 
Convertible Note Purchase Agreement
 
On April 7, 2016, Large Scale entered into
a convertible note purchase agreement with the Issuer (“Convertible Note Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Convertible
Note Purchase Agreement, Large Scale purchased the Note from the Issuer for CAD 2,000,000. Under the terms of the Note, interest
accrues on the principal amount of CAD 2,000,000 (the “Principal Amount”) at a rate of 8% per annum, calculated daily,
compounded monthly, and is payable on the earlier of (i) three years from the issue of the Note; and (ii) the occurrence of an
event of default (the “Maturity Date”). Any interest that is due and payable by the Issuer under the Note may, subject
to Large Scale’s consent, be satisfied by the issue by the Issuer to Large Scale of that number of common shares of the Issuer
equal to the interest due and payable divided by the market price (the volume weighted average trading price of the common shares,
calculated by dividing the total value by the total volume, of the common shares of the Issuer traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange
(“TSX”) for the 5 trading days immediately preceding the relevant date) on the day such interest is due and payable,
subject to TSX approval. Large Scale may, at its option at any time during the period commencing on or after July 1, 2016 and up
to and including the Maturity Date, convert the whole or part of the Principal Amount into common shares of the Issuer at the conversion
price of CAD4.01 per common share of the Issuer (subject to adjustments).The Convertible Note Purchase Agreement was completed
and the Note was issued on May 12, 2016.
 
The Rights Offering by the Issuer in
2016
 
On October 24, 2016, the Issuer announced
that it would issue to the holders of the outstanding Shares of the Issuer as at 5:00p.m. (Toronto Time) on November 3, 2016 (the
“2016 Record Date”) an aggregate of 35,832,750 transferable rights (the “2016 Rights”) to subscribe for
1,990,708 Shares in the capital of the Issuer (the “2016 Rights Offering”).
 
Each registered holder of Shares as of
the 2016 Record Date received one right for each Share held as of the 2016 Record Date. Every eighteen (18) 2016 Rights entitled
the holder thereof to purchase one Share (the “2016 Basic Subscription Privilege”) at a price of CAD 2.58 per Share.
 
In connection with the 2016 Rights Offering,
ITC and Dr. Allan Yap, Director, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer (“Dr. Yap”), entered into a standby
commitment agreement (the “2016 Standby Commitment Agreement”) with the Issuer on October 24, 2016. Pursuant to the
2016 Standby Commitment Agreement, ITC and Dr. Yap agreed to purchase from the Issuer 51% and 49%, respectively, of such number
of Shares that are available for purchase, but not otherwise subscribed for, that would result in 1,990,708 Shares being issued
under the 2016 Rights Offering (the “2016 Standby Commitment”). The purchase commitments of each of ITC and Dr. Yap
under the 2016 Standby Commitment Agreement are subject to a maximum of 1,015,261 and 975,447 Shares, respectively. ITC and Dr.
Yap are therefore obligated to purchase up to a maximum of 1,990,708 Shares in the aggregate, being the maximum number of Shares
that could be issued pursuant to the 2016 Rights Offering. If all of the Shares available for purchase under the 2016 Rights Offering
are subscribed for by the holders of the 2016 Rights, then ITC and Dr. Yap will not be obligated to purchase any Shares under the
2016 Standby Commitment Agreement. The 2016 Rights Offering expires on November 30, 2016, by which time ITC will be notified as
to whether it is required to perform any part of its 2016 Standby Commitment to acquire Shares.
 

 
 

 
As compensation for the Standby Commitment,
each of ITC and Dr. Yap (or their respective nominees) will receive non-transferrable Share purchase warrants (the “2016
Standby Warrants”) entitling ITC (or its nominee) to acquire up to 253,815 Shares and Dr. Yap (or his nominee) to acquire
up to 243,862 Shares. The exercise price of the 2016 Standby Warrants is CAD 2.58 per Share. The 2016 Standby Warrants must be
exercised within 2 years after the date on which the 2016 Standby Commitment is to be fulfilled, being no later than November 30,
2016. The exercisability of the 2016 Standby Warrants will be conditional upon the receipt of the approval of the Issuer’s
shareholders, a meeting of whom is expected to be held in September 2017.

matters listed in Items 4(a) – (j) of Schedule 13D, inclusive.

the Issuer; and (ii) 198,429 warrants of the Issuer with each such warrant entitling Large Scale to acquire 1 Share at CAD 2.26
(subject to adjustments) exercisable on or before April 30, 2017; and (iii) the Note, which is convertible during the period commencing
on or after July 1, 2016 and up to and including the Maturity Date into approximately 498,753 Shares of the Issuer, in total representing

of the aforesaid warrants (“LS Warrant Shares”) and the issuance of 498,753 Shares upon the full conversion of the
aforesaid Note (“LS Note Shares”)).  The aforesaid 5,476,176 Shares, 198,429 LS Warrant Shares and 498,753 LS

filed a Schedule 13G dated January 10, 2012, as amended on January 17, 2013, January 27, 2015 and January 26, 2016, with respect
to the Shares of the Issuer.

owner of the Shares covered by this statement. The Reporting Person expressly disclaims any beneficial ownership of the Shares
that are owned by Large Scale and Great Intelligence.

ownership set out above was derived from the Issuer’s most recent interim report for the three months ended June 30, 2016
filed with the Commission on August 15, 2016, in which the Issuer reported 35,832,750 outstanding Shares as of June 30, 2016.
 
In addition, for the purposes of calculating

TVB 






Dealmaker Charles Chan Kwok-keung  provided more than half of the funds used to acquire media mogul Run Run Shaw's  controlling stake in Television Broadcasts (TVB), according to a senior company executive.  
Mark Lee Po-on,  an executive director and group general manager at TVB, disclosed that detail yesterday before a Legislative Council meeting that looked into the change in shareholding at Hong Kong's biggest free-to-air television broadcaster.  
Chan, the chairman of investment holding firm ITC Corp, led a group of investors in buying the entire 26 per cent stake in Shaw Brothers (Hong Kong) owned by Shaw for HK$6.26 billion.  A well-known dealmaker, Chan was behind the 2000 takeover of Sing Pao, one of Hong Kong's oldest news publications. 
Lee did not provide how much the other members of Chan's group contributed to the TVB share purchase. 
The two other investors are Taiwanese information-technology entrepreneur Cher Wang Hsiueh-hong,  who co-founded smartphone maker HTC Corp and semiconductor firm Via Technologies, and Providence Equity Partners,  a United States-based private equity company that manages US$22 billion in capital and investments worldwide.  
TVB managing director Mona Fong Yat-wah,  who is Shaw's wife, retains a 0.26 per cent shareholding in the company.  
Ambrose Ho Pui-him,  chairman of the Broadcasting Authority, told the Legco meeting that the regulator had checked the financial resources and residential status of each member of Chan's investor group after they made their application to acquire TVB.  
The authority approved the change in TVB's shareholding last month. It said the change would not affect TVB's investment commitment of HK$6.3 billion from 2010 to 2015 made during a mid-term review of the broadcaster's licence last year.
Chan, Wang and Jonathan Nelson, the chief executive of Providence, were named as non-executive directors of TVB on April 1.   
The share price of TVB, the world's biggest distributor of Chinese-language TV programming, rose 0.52 per cent to close at HK$48.40 yesterday.

Hong Kong broadcaster TVB names Charles Chan as new chairman

Deal-maker Charles Chan Kwok-keung has been appointed as the new chairman of TVB, the city's dominant free-to-air television broadcaster.
The announcement was made yesterday with Norman Leung Nai-pang, 74, current executive chairman of the station's board and the chairman of the executive committee, set to retire on January 1.
The news came as TVB's beleaguered rival ATV was still struggling to pay November salaries while awaiting the government's verdict on the renewal of its licence to broadcast. Both ATV's and TVB's licences expire in November next year.
ATV's news staff plan to release a statement on Monday, vowing to stop work on December 30 or 31 if they are still unpaid.
Chan, 59, will assume both of Leung's positions at TVB. He was appointed a non-executive director of TVB in April 2011 after leading a group of investors to buy Shaw Brothers' stake in the broadcaster for HK$6.26 billion.
The investors also included Taiwanese entrepreneur Cher Wang Hsiueh-hong, co-founder of smartphone maker HTC, and Providence Equity Partners, a US private equity company that manages US$22 billion in capital and investments worldwide.
Wang and Jonathan Nelson, the chief executive of Providence, were named as non-executive directors of TVB in April 2011. Chan was appointed to the executive committee in March 2012.
Leung, who had been with TVB for 11 years, succeeded the late Run Run Shaw as executive chairman of the board on January 1, 2012, after the film and television mogul's retirement.
In a statement, Leung thanked TVB colleagues and praised Shaw's achievement in co-founding TVB. "When I took over from Sir Run Run in 2012, I knew his achievement would be a hard act to follow," he said.
Meanwhile, general manager Cheong Shin Keong will become an executive director and sit on the executive committee. Group general manager Mark Lee Po-on will become group CEO.
