History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

Constellation Brands, Boston Beer shares slide after Goldman Sachs downgrades
Shares of Constellation Brands Inc.  slid 1.2% Monday, after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to neutral, while shares of Boston Beer Co. Inc.  fell 5% after Goldman downgraded that stock tosell, citing concerns about slowing U.S. beer volumes. Nielsen data is signaling a 0.6% decline for the first half, analyst Judy Hong said in a note. "We acknowledge that some of the softness is likely due to higher volatility in the measured channel data, as well as less favorable weather patterns," Hong wrote. "However, we increasingly see broader secular challenges of 4-P's (Population, Penetration, Pricing, and Placement) putting pressure on beer volume for the foreseeable future." . Hong lowered her overall U.S. beer volume forecast for 2017 to 2018 to down 0.7% to down 0.3% versus a previous forecast of flat to up 0.1%. The analyst left shares of Molson Coors Brewing Co.  at buy, because "while we see lingering volume risk, undemanding valuation and potential for healthy free cash flow growth warrant a Buy rating with 19% upside, in our view," said the note. Constellation Brands shares have gained 13% in 2017, while Boston Beer has fallen 24% and Molson Coors has lost 9%. The S&P 500  has gained about 10% in the same period.

 Shares of Constellation Brands, Inc. STZ  are riding high on sturdy brand portfolio, strategic endeavors, solid first-quarter fiscal 2018 results and impressive earnings history. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has outpaced both the Zacks categorized Beverages - Alcoholic  industry and the broader sector in the last six months. The stock has rallied 31.5%, comfortably outperforming the industry's advance of 9.9%, which is currently placed at top 10% of the Zacks Classified industries (25 out of 256). Meanwhile, the Zacks categorized Consumer Staples  sector gained 9% and is placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).      Growth Strategies    Armed with a formidable portfolio of well-known brands, Constellation Brands holds a dominant position in the premium wine and beer segment in the U.S. The company is also a leading producer of wine in Canada and New Zealand. This provides it with a competitive edge and also bolsters its well-established position in the market. In addition, its consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products are the key revenue drivers.  Owing to its strategic efforts, the company is witnessing robust depletion trends and increasing market share, especially in the U.S. beer category. Notably, Constellation Brands was the highest growth contributor in this category for the fourth straight year in fiscal 2017.    Furthermore, management is focused on expanding in the craft beer space, which has become a solid growth avenue in the beer space. Constellation Brands is making meaningful leadership changes in an attempt to improve its operational activities too. In fact, its focus on enhancing points of distribution at retail and effectively executing its strategic merchandising initiatives to boost sales is encouraging.    Meanwhile, Constellation Brands' focus on expanding operations to achieve business growth is noteworthy as its results continued to gain from the recent buyouts. Currently, the company is on track with the Nava brewery and glass plant expansion, while it enhanced its wine portfolio with the buyout of Schrader Cellars. Additionally, the acquisition of Obregon Brewery is likely to bolster its high-end Mexican beer portfolio, going forward.   Splendid Q1 Results & Outlook    Constellation Brands showcased another sterling performance in first-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its 16th straight quarter of earnings growth year over year and 11th straight positive surprise. While sales missed estimates after six straight quarters of beat, it improved year over year. Results gained from its efforts to drive consumer demand and contributions from acquisitions, along with continued strength in the company's beer business in particular. Moreover, lower cost of goods sold in the quarter improved pricing and volumes boosted margins. In fact, the company has delivered gross and operating margin growth in the trailing four quarters.    Apart from these factors, confidence in its beer business encouraged management to raise its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2018. Constellation Brands now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $7.90-$8.10 per share versus $7.70-$8.00, guided earlier. Notably, the encouraging outlook has also perked up the earnings estimates in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.13 and $9.14 for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has climbed 14 cents and 19 cents, respectively.   Bottom Line    Though the recent sale of the Canadian wine business led Constellation Brands to post lower-than-expected sales, effective integration and growth of its recently acquired brands make us optimistic about the company's ability to sustain momentum. Also, it has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 18.2%.    Meanwhile, you may also count upon some other top-ranked stocks such as Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. BREW  , Energizer Holdings, Inc. ENR  and Ambev S.A. ABEV  .    Craft Brew Alliance has delivered positive earnings surprise of 50% in the last reported quarters and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Energizer Holdings, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 21.6% in the trailing four quarters. Also, it has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%.

Constellation Brands: Is The Party Over? - Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Constellation Brands: Is The Party Over?May.17.17 | About: Constellation Brands, (STZ) RoaringInvestor Long/short equity, value, special situations, GrowthSummaryCurrent market position will provide competitive advantages that will drive future growth.The company's vertical business model will continue to provide operational efficiency.Growth in wine business will diversify the business and provide additional revenue opportunities.Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) has provided investors with incredible returns over the last five years.(Source: Yahoo Finance)

 However, lately, many investors are beginning to think that growth is over and that they should begin to exit their position. This article will discuss why we think that stock price growth will continue in the next five years. Thesis 1: Existing Market Foothold Will Guide Future Growth We believe that the existing foothold the company has within this market, alongside a wide array of product lines, will provide competitive advantages that will ensure future growth. The company is currently the third largest producer and distributor of beer in the U.S and has ranked number 1 in terms of premium wine sales. Specifically, the company imports a variety of popular beers from Mexico such as Modelo Especial, Pacifico, Negra Modelo, and Corona. These brands have displayed market dominance and growth, with Corona Light being ranked the number one imported light beer in terms of revenue and Modelo Especial consistently ranking in the top 5 fastest-growing beer brands. When it comes to hard liquors, Svedka Vodka has been extremely successful since launch and has become the second largest imported vodka in the U.S. As can be seen from these examples, Constellation does a great job establishing its brands regardless of the beverage line it operates in. We believe that the economies of scale and distribution networks that are available to the company due to its strong market presence will allow the company to expand to new products and establish them at the top of the market with relative ease. The following chart signifies the projected earnings of the company via Capital IQ estimates that should provide a baseline for probable future growth within the company.(Source: Capital IQ)


 Thesis 2: Strong Operational Capabilities Due to Vertical Business Model We have witnessed significant improvements in the profitability of Constellation Brands, much of which can be attributed to the improved operational efficiencies of the company. The chart below shows historical improvements in EBITDA margins in addition to projected number for the next three years. (Source: Capital IQ)

 We believe that a significant portion of these efficiencies stems from having a wide variety of production facilities that allows the company to leverage geographical and managerial expertise to produce cost-efficient products. Currently, the company operates five beer breweries, 36 wineries, as well as various warehouses and glass production facilities. Having a vertically integrated supply chain provides the company with larger margins as it does not have to split revenues with third parties as well as increased flexibility in terms of production. We believe that this business model will continue to drive value as the firm increases its margins to an approximate 37% by 2020. Thesis 3: Strategic Acquisitions to Grow Wine Business While the beer business has undoubtedly been the focus of the firm in the past, we are encouraged by the diversification that is currently taking place. We view the focus on M&A activity to increase operational efficiencies and enter into new markets as a positive that will drive more value for shareholders. Constellation Brands has specifically focused on expanding its wine products. For example, in April of 2016, the company acquired The Prisoner Wine Company's brand portfolio. This transaction included popular brands such as Saldo, Cuttings, Thorn, and Blindfold. This particular move was a strategic shift to increase the company's focus on the wine business by expanding its already existing portfolio. Additionally, the company has expanded its existing facilities through additional investment such as its $32.8 million investment in the expansion of its Marlborough winery. We will continue to monitor future investments of this sort and believe that the wine industry could provide the needed growth opportunities to provide solid returns to investors.
 Risks First, we would like to point out that the company has experienced consistent drops in its net working capital over the last few years. The company has gone from having $1.78 billion in 2015 to just $705 million in 2016. (Source: Capital IQ)

 This may hinder our third thesis that discussed the company making significant investments to grow its wine business. We will continue to monitor this closely and recommend that all investors who are interested in this stock to do the same. Takeaway We like Constellation Brands due to its existing market position, efficient operations, vertical business model, and strategic expansion into wine. We believe this stock will provide 10%+ returns for the next five years.

CSR at Constellation Brands




























































ELEVATING LIFERESPONSIBLYEVERY DAY Read our CSR story.



 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been woven into our culture and core values at Constellation Brands since we began doing business in 1945. We believe that our long-term success is tied directly to our ability to make a positive difference in our communities.We have a responsibility to care for the land, people, and communities where we live and work. Operating responsibly is important to us, and not just because it is the right thing to do. It helps us operate more efficiently and minimize our resource use. It is important to many of our key stakeholders and partners, from customers and investors to government officials and our neighbors in our communities. It is also a clear driver of employee engagement, and helps us foster a positive company culture and attract the best talent. Our commitment to doing business responsibly is crucial to building a stronger business, successful brands, and value for our shareholders. Our FocusThe mission of our CSR program is to elevate life through our commitment to care for the environment, inspire communities and promote responsible consumption of our products. To accomplish this, we have three primary focus areas: Giving Back, Social Responsibility, and Sustainability.









Giving BackWe aim to have a positive and lasting impact in the communities where we live and work. Constellation has long had a culture of giving that is driven by the passion of our employees.> More on Giving Back









Social ResponsibilityWe produce, advertise and promote our products in a responsible manner, and support efforts to eliminate underage consumption of beverage alcohol and drunk driving.> More on Social Responsibility 









SustainabilityWe understand and act on our environmental stewardship responsibilities, and look for ways to minimize our organization's worldwide environmental impact. > More on SustainabilityOur People Take the Lead









Our CSR efforts are driven by the heart and soul of our people. Employees at every level make a positive difference. They do it with passion and generosity, displaying the core values that unify us and make us a successful company.

— Rob Sands, president and CEO
As has been the case since our founding, our people lead our CSR efforts. Our CSR Steering Committee, which is made up of senior leaders from across our company, sets the strategic direction for our overall CSR program. Each of our three pillars - giving back, sustainability, and social responsibility - has a committee that sets strategy for its respective pillar, identifies opportunities, and manages the execution of our initiatives. These committees are comprised of a wide range of employees to ensure that the voices of our many different geographies, job functions, and employee groups are represented. It is clear that our employees are passionate about elevating life responsibly every day. Read why in their own words below, and throughout this site.

History[edit]
The company was established in 1945 by Marvin Sands in the Finger Lakes region of New York as Canandaigua Industries, selling bulk wine to bottlers in the eastern United States[6]. In its first year, the company sold approximately 200,000 gallons of wine and had gross sales of $150,000.[7]
The company was incorporated as Canandaigua Wine Company, Inc. in 1972 and went public in 1973.[8] Marvin's son Richard Sands became president in 1993 and CEO in 1996.[6] In 1999, company founder Marvin Sands passed away following a brief illness.[6]
In 2000, the company changed its name to Constellation Brands, Inc. to reflect the scope of the company and its range of brands.[7] In 2007, Rob Sands was named president and CEO.[9]
In 2013, Constellation acquired Grupo Modelo's U.S. beer business from Anheuser-Busch InBev. The transaction included full ownership of Crown Imports LLC which provided Constellation with complete, independent control of all aspects of the U.S. commercial business; a brewery in Nava, Mexico; exclusive perpetual brand license in the U.S. to import, market and sell Corona and the Modelo brands and the freedom to develop brand extensions and innovations for the U.S. market.[9]
In 2014, Constellation finalized a joint venture with Owens-Illinois and completed the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch InBev's glass production plant, located adjacent to the company's brewery in Nava, Mexico.[10]
Wine fraud[edit]
In 2010, a French court in Carcassonne, France, convicted 12 wine traders and producers for selling fake Pinot noir wine to buyers in the US, amongst them Constellation, in a scheme that lasted from January 2006 to March 2008. Constellation later faced and settled a class action lawsuit because it "should have known" that the wine was fake.[11]
Acquisitions[edit]




Constellation Brands moved its headquarters to a 120,000 square feet (11,000 m2) building on 11 acres (4.5 ha) in Victor, New York in 2009


Constellation Brands has expanded by acquiring other drinks companies.
In 1987, the company purchased the Manischewitz winery in Canandaigua, New York, and continues to license the Manischewitz name from R.A.B. Foods.[12]
In 1998 it acquired Matthew Clark plc in the United Kingdom, and after selling off its cider business, the Gaymer Cider Company, sold half of the business to Punch Taverns. Acquisitions include BRL Hardy (Australia)[13] and Nobilo (New Zealand) in 2003; Robert Mondavi Corp. for $1 billion in 2004;[14] Vincor International, Canada's largest wine company, for $1.44 billion in 2006;[15] Spirits Marque One (owner of Svedka Vodka) in 2007;[16] and Beam Wines Estates, the wine operations of Fortune Brands (which included several major brands such as Clos du Bois) for $885 million in 2008.[17] The company later moved to a more premium wine portfolio, divesting Almaden Vineyards, Inglenook Winery, and the Paul Masson winery in Madera, California, in 2008,[18] and its value spirits portfolio to the Sazerac Company in 2009.[19]
In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.
In December 2015, Constellation announced the $1 billion acquisition of Ballast Point Brewing of San Diego.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
