			Mr. Brouillard, 68, became a member of our Board in May 2004 and served as Executive Chairman from November 2015 to May 2016, after serving as non-executive chair of the Board from January 2008 to November 2015. Prior to that time, he served as interim Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company from May 2007 until January 2008 and Lead Director from February 14, 2007 to May 2007. Mr. Brouillard retired as Chief Administrative and Financial Officer of H.E. Butt Grocery Company, a regional food retailer, in June 2005, a position that he had held since February 1991. From 1977 to 1991, Mr. Brouillard held various positions with Hills Department Stores, a discount department store company, including serving as President of that company. 

Mr. Brouillard's background as a chief administrative and financial officer with a grocery retail company recognized for outstanding customer service provides him with strong insights into the types of management and financial issues that face companies in the retail sector. After having served on our Board for over ten years, including seven years as the independent Board Chair and eight months as the interim Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Brouillard is uniquely situated to understand the inner workings of Advance's Board and management processes. His considerable experience in finance and accounting matters has been valuable to the Board and the Company's management, and his past service on the board of another public company has strengthened his understanding of the governance concerns facing public companies.
