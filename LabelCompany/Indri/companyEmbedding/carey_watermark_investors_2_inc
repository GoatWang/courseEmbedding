What our customers say ...








                                    Thank you to the team at the Angel Investment Network who just helped us raise £500,000 to accelerate the expansion of our Thai food restaurant business. The Angel Investment Network team did a great job supporting us through the fundraising process. A process which resulted in us raising the full amount we were looking for from a great bunch of angel investors.                                 







Alex Moore @ Rosa's
 www.rosasthaicafe.com                                        








                                    We have been working with Angel Investment Network since 2011 and have raised over £500k to help fund production of series 1 & 2 of our award winning children's show Sarah&Duck.  Angel Investment Network have provided us with an extremely professional service introducing us to influential backers who have continued to support our business.  Highly recommended!

                                    We successfully raised investment after advertising our proposal on Angel Investment Network. We had over 10 interested parties, looking to help develop our UK retail websites selling designer watches online. Before selecting the right investor, which we have now signed a contract with, we have taken our watch sales to the next level. Thanks for all the help and keep up the good work :)

Risk Factors: 
This investment contains a high degree of risk, which is detailed in the Risk Factors section of the Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (CWI 2) prospectus. You should consider all of the risks described in the prospectus before you decide to purchase our securities, including the following:

There is no public market for our shares; a public market is unlikely ever to develop and we are not required ever to provide you with liquidity for your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before we complete a liquidity event, you will likely receive less than your purchase price.

We have a limited operating history and you will be unable to evaluate our complete investment portfolio prior to your investment.

Our advisor and the sub advisor will be paid substantial fees based on factors other than the quality of services provided, which may encourage them to use increased leverage or to make riskier investments. Our agreements with our advisor, the sub advisor and Carey Financial, LLC, the dealer manager, are not arm’s length agreements.

We will be subject to the risks of operating lodging properties and the lodging industry generally. Failure of lodging industry fundamentals to continue to improve may adversely affect our business strategy.

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would adversely affect our operations and ability to make distributions. 

The payment of distributions is subject to the Board of Directors and there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any future distributions. Distributions are not guaranteed. Our distribution coverage using FFO was approximately 19% of total distributions for both the year ended December 31, 2016 and on a cumulative basis through that date with the balance funded with proceeds from our offering. Our distributions will likely exceed earnings before we have substantially invested the net proceeds of the public offering and may be paid without limit from offering proceeds, borrowings or sales of assets, which could reduce your overall return.

We may change our investment policies, including our targeted class of investments, without stockholder notice or approval, which could change the nature of your investment and adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objectives.

As a new investor, you will experience substantial dilution in the net tangible book value of your shares equal to your shares’ proportionate share of the costs of the offering.

Shares of our common stock are subject to a 9.8% ownership limitation that is intended, among other purposes, to assist us in complying with restrictions imposed on REITs by the Internal Revenue Code.

Research may not reflect all views or studies of the past and prospective performance of the lodging industry. The information presented in this website may be known by others including existing and potential competitors, and competitive factors may diminish issuer returns.


Not FDIC or NCUA/NCUSIF insured, not bank or credit union guaranteed and may lose value.

CWI 1's Performance


Our Investment Process
















CWI 1's Performance 









T-

reset font size






CWI 1 has established and continues to build what we believe is a diversified, well-performing portfolio of hotels. Its portfolio is comprised of a mix of select and full-service hotels and resorts, representing both current income and growth-oriented properties across the U.S.
During the first quarter of 2017, CWI 1's portfolio has outperformed the U.S. Lodging Industry as a whole:

 
1 Occupancy is the percentage of rooms sold divided by rooms available.
2 ADR, or average daily rate, is room revenue divided by rooms sold, displayed as the average rental rate for a single room.
3 RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is room revenue divided by available rooms.
4 STR, Inc., April 2017. (Date for the nine months ended 03/31/17)
5 Represents statistical data for our Consolidated Hotels during our ownership period.


For the first quarter 2017.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.
Although we expect lodging fundamentals to continue to improve, there can be no assurance as to the extent or duration of the improvement.

NEW YORK, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (CWI 2), a non-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in lodging and lodging-related properties, announced that it has acquired the Charlotte Marriott City Center, located in Uptown, Charlotte's central business district (CBD).  
Key Facts













                Carey Watermark Investors 2 Acquires the Charlotte Marriott City Center
              

 
 




Newly renovated, high-quality asset: Over $40 million of capital improvements to the property were completed in 2016 to reposition it as the most technologically advanced full-service property within the Marriott Hotels system. Now dubbed the "Beta Hotel" for its cutting-edge concepts, the recent renovations have transformed the upscale property into an ultra-modern hotel, featuring innovative guest rooms, public space, event space and programming. The property functions as a real-time platform for guest feedback and ideas to enhance all aspects of the hotel experience. The comprehensive renovation added eight guest rooms, five unique food and beverage outlets, a state-of-the-art fitness center, a newly programmed M Club Lounge and lobby core. 
Strong lodging market: Charlotte's Uptown market has been one of the fastest growing lodging markets in the US, achieving a 5.8% RevPAR compound average growth rate (CAGR) since 1990 versus the US average of 3.1%. The 2016 RevPAR for the Charlotte CBD increased 5.5% year-over-year, further illustrating the strong demand in the Charlotte marketplace. 
Central location: The Charlotte Marriott City Center sits at one of the busiest intersections in Charlotte's CBD, surrounded by 16 million square feet of office space. Several Fortune 500 companies, including Bank of America, Duke Energy and the East Coast operations of Wells Fargo, are located in the CBD. The area is also home to major sports teams with stadiums within one mile of the hotel. Other nearby demand generators include the NASCAR Hall of Fame, the 280,000-square foot Charlotte Convention Center and EpiCentre, Charlotte's primary mixed-use entertainment and dining attraction. Over two million square feet of office space, 600,000 square feet of retail space and 3,400 residential units are currently under construction or are in planning in the immediate area. 
Strong brand affiliation and management: CWI 2 has entered into a long-term management agreement with Marriott International and the hotel will continue to benefit from its Marriott brand affiliation and management. 
Property and amenities: 

19-story institutional quality building 
446 guest rooms including 4 suites, 23 stay/well rooms with full access to the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Programs and 3 concierge levels 
20,000 square feet of meeting space and 13 breakout areas, including a 9,100-square foot ballroom 
Five unique food and beverage outlets, including Stoke Restaurant, an immersive kitchen concept featuring locally sourced ingredients, and the M Club Lounge 
24-hour, state-of-the-art fitness center 
Business center


Management Commentary
Michael Medzigian, Chief Executive Officer of CWI 2, said: "We are extremely pleased to continue to expand on our already important relationship with Marriott International and to support them as they continue to embrace hotel innovation and shape the future of travel. With the transformative renovation of the property incorporating Marriott's latest design and technology concepts, the Charlotte Marriott City Center is now recognized as one of the flagship Marriott properties throughout the country. With the strength of its location in the heart of the CBD, one of the highest growth lodging markets in the US, we believe the property is not only well positioned to deliver attractive current cash flow but also to benefit from the ongoing strength of the local economy. Given our own focus on continuing to develop product and service concepts to enhance the guest experience, the property's designation as M Beta made it a strategic acquisition for the CWI 2 portfolio."

What our customers say ...








                                    We had previously struggled to raise consistent capital for our project.  Once our pitch was live on the platform we received our first investor within 24 hours.  We've since completed two rounds of funding through the site and have been very happy with the results!                                







Michael D Russo @ HAL Network

                                    Many thanks for your help, without which I never would have fulfilled my dream.  I know exactly where to come if I need more capital in the future.

                                    Hi guys, I would like to inform you that our proposal for a expansion of a franchise chain of Steak Houses in Stockholm, got a huge response from your investors and within two weeks we had a deal done and collected all the investment we needed. I can recommend this site to any start ups with a good idea looking for funding to make your dream a reality!

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
