Overview


Description
 This groundbreaking new text combines the second and third semesters of calculus with the first and second semesters of calculus-based physics. Used successfully at the authors' school in a two-semester course, the text provides full integration of the math and physics. Through text and problems, the authors carefully develop the calculus so that it can be used in many physical applications. In turn, the physics provides examples for the development of the calculus concepts. As a result, students gain a full understanding of calculus and its relevance to physics. 













About the Author(s)
Dr. Andrew Rex received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Virginia in 1982 after receiving an B.A. in Physics from Illinois Wesleyan University. At Virginia his research focused on experimental solid state physics. Since 1982 he has been a faculty member at the University of Puget Sound, and he currently holds the rank of Professor. His principal research interests have been in Mossbauer spectroscopy, the physics of sports, and Maxwell's demon and information theory. At the University of Puget Sound he has served as Director of the Pre-Engineering Program, Director of the university's Honors Program and Chair of the Physics Department.
Dr. Rex has published five books including Integrated Physics and Calculus, Vols. 1 and 2, Addison-Wesley 1999, and has written a number of scientific articles and papers. He is a member of the American Association of Physics Teachers, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi and Sigma Pi Sigma.
In 1994 he received a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education to develop a program that integrates freshman physics and calculus into a single course and to write a textbook for that course. 

Dr. Martin Jackson received his Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Oregon in 1990 after receiving a M.S. degree in Physics there in 1985 and a B.S. in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Puget Sound in 1984. He was named an Assistant Professor at the University of Puget Sound in 1990 in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and Associate Professor in 1996.
He has published scientific articles in the Journal of Differential Geometry, the American Journal of Physics, the Journal of Physics, the Journal of Mathematical Physics, and other publications.
In 1994 he and Dr. Andrew Rex received a three-year grant from the U.S. Department of Education to develop a program that integrates freshman physics and calculus into a single course and to write a textbook for that course.
