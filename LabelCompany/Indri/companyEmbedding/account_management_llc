LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Career Overview: Account Management


Posted by The Editors on December 3, 2012











OverviewYou have sales. You have customer service. And then you have the account manager (AM), with one foot in each department. AMs act as the liaison between a company and its clients, and it's their responsibility to see that those clients are maximizing the value of the products and services provided. But there's a large sales component to their job as well. It's the AMs' duty to maintain, retain, and usually upsell to their portfolio of clients or accounts.You'll find the account management function at all types of companies, including consulting firms, service providers, and employment, advertising, and public relations agencies. AMs with an auto-paint company, for instance, manage the company's relationships with clients like GM or DaimlerChrysler, or with body shops and auto-painting shops. At a high-tech company, AMs are the primary point of contact between the company providing the technology and the clients using it.What You'll Do  AMs work closely with clients to determine the clients' needs. Then they make sure their company develops products or services to meet those needs. As part of their job, AMs create budgets and schedules for meeting their accounts' needs and enforce deadlines for product development efforts (in manufacturing industries) or client projects (in service industries). They also communicate clients' agendas to their staff and management, and communicate the concerns and capabilities of their company to the client.Frequently, AMs also identify and solicit new customers, so sales is a part of the job as well. "If you can't stand sales, don't go into account management," one insider says. Still, the difference between a salesperson and an account manager is that instead of selling the account and then handing it off to customer service, the AM maintains an active role in the post-sale follow-up. In an advertising agency, that may mean overseeing execution of ads. In a software company, it may mean overseeing a rollout of a new system by spending time on-site, helping to train the client. In a manufacturing company, it may mean ensuring that orders are delivered on time.Who Does Well  AMs need to be detail-oriented. Organization is a key part of the job. You will be expected to keep on top of every aspect of a project. Good communication skills are also necessary. AMs interact with clients on the one hand and internal staff and management on the other.Promises made to customers must be kept. You can't offer more than your company can deliver. You need to know exactly what services you can provide and how quickly a project can be completed.You'll need to learn as much as you can about your clients. Only if you have a strong understanding of a client's business strategy will you be able to understand and communicate how your company's products and services can help the client's strategic goals.You'll also need to know all about the industries in which your clients compete. The more industry insight you bring to the table, the better. Read up on changing business trends and strategies. That knowledge will attract new accounts and keep the ones you already have.Unfortunately, not all projects go as planned. Sometimes a client won't like the work that has been done. It's up to the account manager to fix the problem. He or she will talk to the client, find out what's wrong, and try to come up with a solution.Some clients will be harder to work with than others, so AMs need to be able to handle stress well. They also need to be creative, in order to figure out work-around solutions when something goes wrong. At times, you may need to hold a client's hand as you walk him through a project.Finally, when a deadline looms, long hours may be required. RequirementsStart by contacting your campus career center. It can put you in touch with alumni already working in the profession. If possible, ask an alumnus or another current AM for an interview to gather information about the career. The AM can explain how he broke into the field, what the job entails, and ways to meet other people in the industry. As your network of contacts grows, you will find out about new positions as they become available.If you're interested in advertising account management and you're lucky enough to be at a school where advertising agencies recruit entry-level hires, be sure to sign up to interview with those agencies when they come to your campus. Internships are another way in: Proving yourself as an intern at an advertising or PR agency is a great way to get hired. Other types of internships can be just as valuable; journalism, marketing, and broadcasting skills can apply to account management. This kind of work experience enables you to build up your portfolio and resume. Companies look for prospective employees who take the initiative and know how to work under a deadline.In high-tech fields, an engineering degree-or at least some experience with and understanding of the technology provided by the company you want to work for-can be a prerequisite for employment.In some manufacturing industries, some account management professionals find that getting Certified Professional Manufacturer's Representative credentials can help their careers.For higher-level positions, a college degree and significant work experience are required. Many account supervisors have sales or marketing backgrounds. Other qualifications include strong written and oral communication skills, management experience, a can-do attitude, and a willingness to take initiative. Job OutlookThe outlook for account managers varies by industry. If you're interested in working in the U.S. steel industry, for instance-or any other industry that's well past its peak-you won't find many opportunities. In general, though, things are looking up. Businesses have started spending money again on advertising and technology, so AMs in these and other industries face a rosier future than in recent times.In the longer term, manufacturing account management opportunities will likely grow at a slower rate than in other industries. But since the advertising industry is projected to grow faster than average in coming years, AM opportunities in advertising should grow faster than jobs overall. And in high-tech, AM opportunities should grow at about the same rate as the economy overall. In each of these industries, the job outlook will vary in different sectors, depending on which are growing and which are more mature. For instance, while advertising as a whole should offer a slightly above-average job outlook, things are more promising for AMs who work with interactive ad agencies or sell search engine ads, since online marketing is soaring. Career TracksAccount management responsibilities vary depending on the industry and the nature of the organization. Client prospecting and solicitation are expected. You must build relationships between your organization and its clients. Customers should feel comfortable coming to you with ideas for new projects and changes to existing ones.Account management positions also involve administrative duties, such as fielding client phone calls, entering information in databases, and putting together bulk mailings. Almost all positions require a significant amount of customer contact.Account Coordinator  Most new hires in advertising and PR begin as account coordinators. This entry-level position provides administrative support to the account management team. Typical job responsibilities include filing, putting together mailings, sending out press releases, monitoring media coverage of the agency's clients, and data entry.Although customer contact is limited, account coordinators work with all members of their department. They cultivate skills they'll put to good use later. Account managers coordinate everything and everyone. They make sure no details fall through the cracks. Eventually, account coordinators are given additional responsibilities at client-related events. Most can expect to be promoted after one year.Account Executive  This is the frontline position of account management. Most customer contact takes place through account executives (AEs), who work directly with clients and manage their accounts.AEs ensure that ongoing projects are running smoothly. They monitor the progress of the creative team (at an ad agency) or product development team (at a manufacturing or tech company), ensure deadlines are met, and answer any questions the client may have. Most AEs are expected to pitch ideas to new prospects.Other responsibilities vary depending on the organization and industry. An AE in a sales organization, for example, may call on customers, develop PowerPoint presentations, and send out marketing materials. At an employment agency, an AE will seek recruits, screen applicants, and post clients' job listings on the Internet.Account Manager  The AM (or account supervisor) has responsibilities similar to those of the AE. Both spend a lot of time working directly with clients to understand their needs and communicate those ideas to their employer's staff and management. The AM must ensure that all levels of his or her organization buy into a project. Otherwise, it may stall out in development or not be completed to the client's satisfaction.AMs should understand marketing principles and how they apply to their industries. This helps them plan and oversee projects effectively. An AM needs a broad understanding of how his or her company operates and of which departments handle which tasks. Most important, the AM controls project implementation, managing the day-to-day operations. AMs follow a project from inception to completion. They supervise its development and provide status reports to clients. It's an AM's responsibility to inform a customer when a project is behind schedule or over budget. Clients are referred to AMs when they've any problems or questions.At a Web-development company, for example, an account manager is involved in the planning of a particular product or service that will be provided to her clients. She facilitates communication between various departments in her company, such as technology, finance, and production, and she decides how such information is relayed from one department to another. Finally, the AM makes sure the client is happy with the completed product. When problems arise, the AM is responsible for rectifying them.

What is Key Account Management?



Mike Schultz















 "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."– Inigo Montoya
People at large companies bandy about the terms "key account management" and "strategic account management" in conversation every day.
Ask 10 people to define what these are, or to tell you what the criteria are for an account to be named a "key" account, and you’re likely to get 10 very different answers.
When companies lack an effective and universally understood definition of key account management, their success is hampered from the start. If you can’t define something, it’s difficult to develop a strategy around it.
At RAIN Group, we define key account management as:
A systematic approach to managing and growing a named set of an organization's most important customers to maximize mutual value and achieve mutually beneficial goals.
There’s a lot packed into the definition. Each word has been chosen carefully, as words create meaning, meaning drives behavior, and behavior drives results.
 6 Components of Defining Key Account Management
As well as having a core definition, we find that having a shared understanding of the following six components of key account management helps create focus.

Viewing key accounts as separate from those that are simply large accounts in terms of revenue.
Limiting the number of key accounts, and protecting vigorously from uncontrolled and ill-advised key account list growth.
Pursuing key accounts as institutional partners such that you build innovation and value together, becoming deeply linked to each other’s future.
Allocating key account focus on three core topics: penetrating, expanding, and protecting accounts from competition.
Viewing key accounts as assets that require continued, and often significant, investment to yield maximum returns. These investments often include structuring and aligning your business’ processes and systems to maximize account value.
Viewing key account investment returns as tied to long-term business strategy.

Companies that agree on a definition and the components of a key account can make great headway. Without agreement, however, efforts stall out before they can even get started.
 Differentiating Sales and Key Account Management
We spend quite a bit of time differentiating between the concepts of sales and account management with our clients. As we wrote in Why Strategic Account Management Fails – And What to Do About It, they are not the same thing.
But they’re both necessary, and they work closely together.
Take a look at the stages of RAIN Group’s Strategic Account Management Process:
 

Account management skills are required throughout, but without the sales skills necessary for execution, your efforts will not come to fruition.
In our research, The Benchmark Report on High Performance in Strategic Account Management, we found that weak strategic account management and sales skills ranked as one of the top challenges for average and below-average performers.
Without strong sales skills, you can’t:

Create new opportunities
Penetrate new buying centers
Inspire clients to pursue new ideas and possibilities
Understand clients’ buying processes
Move opportunities forward
Stand out against the competition
Make a compelling business case for buying
Present solutions, overcome objections, and win new business

Without account management skills, you can’t build a good account strategy or plan, won’t put the right team together, and won’t be able to work with clients over the long term to maximize the overall strength of relationships. (Learn the key differences between selling and strategic account management here: 5 Ways Strategic Account Management and Selling Are Different.)
How to go about building long lasting sales and key account management skills is the topic for another piece, but the fact remains: your team needs the skills to implement key account plans and implement them well.
If you want to grow key accounts, you first need to create a universal key account definition, and make sure everyone understands it, agrees with it, and lives by it. Secondly, you need your team to excel with both account management and sales skills.

[New Research] Benchmark Report on Top Performance in Strategic Account Management
When we studied strategic account management in 2012, 59% of sales leaders believed there was greater than 25% revenue growth potential in their existing accounts.
In a separate, more recent research initiative, we found that the #1 priority for sales leaders in the year ahead is to increase business with existing accounts. We also discovered that Top Performers are nearly 2x more likely to be effective at maximizing sales to their existing accounts.




The Holy Grail of Strategic Account Management
For our Top Performance in Strategic Account Management Benchmark Report, we studied two specific processes for driving value with accounts.




Achieve This Year's #1 Sales Priority
Ridiculous Upside is the name of a well-known blog that covers up-and-coming basketball players that could make the NBA, but need further development to reach their potential. Too bad that the basketball bloggers took the name, because ridiculous upside is a great way to describe the untapped potential hiding in most every company's existing accounts.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/30/2016
            

                BBB has determined that Reliant Account Management LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

Advertise Honestly

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by:

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Reliant Account Management LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

Have We Stopped Taking Account Management Seriously Again?
Three Criteria That Can Make or Break Client-Agency Partnerships


	By  

Meghan McDonnell.
	

	
	
 Published on April 10, 2014. 














Most Popular






 

After many years of debate about the role and importance of account management -- "Is Account Management Dead?"; "Is Account Management Back?" -- the chatter appears to have died down, and everyone seems to be in agreement that account management is indeed valuable and needed.
However, I'm starting to wonder if everyone is really convinced. In our agency reviews and performance evaluations, we're hearing from many clients that, once again, the core components of account management -- strategy, leadership and relationship-building -- are missing from their partnerships. And when I recently attended a new-business meeting at which an agency didn't even have an account person present, it made me wonder, "Are we taking account management seriously?"
In hearing from our clients, I know that account management is one of the most important investments an agency can make, if taken seriously and supported appropriately.
Here are three account management criteria that we see marketers prioritizing in agency reviews. Criteria that can often mean the difference between good vs. great account management, and ultimately, good vs. great client-agency partnerships.
Strategy
I'm putting this criterion first because I think it's the most nebulous and misunderstood, as departments such as business insights, brand planning and media continue to grow in importance. Strategy for account management means looking at a client's business with a broader view of its industry and competition, and then marrying that analysis with communications principles. Some account management teams are doing this. Others are not, which isn't entirely surprising. With so many strategic players in so many disciplines, it can feel like an account person's strategic role isn't "real."
Here's why it's quite real: Clients expect their agency counterparts to know their business. It isn't about becoming the product manager. It isn't about line extensions. It's about bringing your communications expertise to the specific objectives of the business. It's about bringing new thinking that works within the realities of your client's brand and budget. This is the job of account management. And if your account team isn't doing it, no one is. Not planning. Not business insights. Not media. They have their own strategic fish to fry.










Relationship-building
Even for naysayers, the client relationship is still the need everyone points to when quantifying account management's value. However, we need to define what taking care of the client really means. Is it the credit-card-carrying Pete Campbell [from "Mad Men"], martini-lunch variety? While taking care of the client will always be part of an account manager's role, agencies are missing a big opportunity if they think that's where the account team's role begins and ends.
Building relationships with clients entails open and honest communication. A great account person maintains the trust of the client and a deeper understanding of what works and what doesn't work for its business. Effective account management leaders anticipate problems vs. simply reacting, and help their teams navigate through challenging points in the partnership. Breakdown in communication between the client and agency is one of the top reasons a partnership goes south. To elevate the relationship from vendor to partner requires more than just a "yes man."
Leadership
Today, agencies talk a lot about the quadrumvirate of account management, creative, brand planning and media as a successful model. And it is. However, the shared importance of these four disciplines -- at some agencies -- has brought about the denigration of account management's leadership role.
Further complicating the issue, project management has been absorbed into many account management teams. Execution is clearly a huge piece of an agency's job -- and it can be incredibly difficult to focus on anything beyond getting the work out the door -- but the account management team needs to be bigger than timelines and to-do lists.
Do you have an account leader who is a palpable presence on your team -- to clients, creative, planning and the host of other groups working on the business? Do you have an account director (or higher) who can present confidently in front of the client's executive team? Is there someone on the account side whom the creative director (or higher) respects for his or her insight on the industry and relationship with the client's CMO? Creative, brand planning, media and other disciplines can and should be elevated in importance, but this cannot be at the expense of account management's ability to lead.
So, take a look at your account team and ask if your agency is assisting in the growth and development of bright, empowered account leaders. Because when it comes to the value account management can bring to your client relationships, there should be no debate.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
