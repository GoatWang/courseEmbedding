Company Profile

InvenSense, a TDK Group company, is a world leading provider of MEMS sensor platforms found in Mobile, Wearables, Smart Home, Industrial, and Automotive products. The company’s patented Fabrication Platform, MotionFusion® technology, audio solutions, and location software and services addresses the emerging need of many mass-market consumer applications via improved performance, accuracy, and intuitive motion-, gesture- and sound-based interfaces.
In May of 2017, InvenSense became part of the MEMS Sensors Business Group within the newly formed Sensor Systems Business Company of TDK Corporation. TDK currently focuses on three market segments: automotive, industrial equipment & energy, and information & communications technology (ICT). As part of its strategy for growth in these key areas, TDK has identified sensors and actuators, energy units and next-generation electronic components as three product areas for strategic growth aimed at unlocking new business opportunities in the sphere of the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors are viewed as an important IoT-enabling technology, and sensor products and the technology portfolio of TDK will expand dramatically as a result of its acquisition of InvenSense.
MotionTracking solutions are rapidly becoming key functions in every consumer electronics device as it provides a more intuitive way for consumers to interact with their electronic devices by tracking their motions in free space and delivering these motions as input commands. Audio is similarly becoming complementary to motion as a means for interacting with contextually aware devices and applications. InvenSense’s vision is to be the leading provider of sensor Systems on Chips (SoC) platform solutions providing an ‘AlwaysOn’ solution by enabling the most seamless sensing experience at the lowest power.
InvenSense’s microphone portfolio builds on a strong heritage of industry firsts, including continuous improvement of MEMS microphone SNR, ever-higher integration levels, and even lower power consumption. InvenSense combines the capability to sense audio along with cutting-edge motion detection, which is important for many contextual awareness applications.
InvenSense’s MotionTracking portfolio of products and services accurately tracks complex user motions, requiring the use of motion sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, compasses, and pressure sensors, properly calibrating the data, and then fusing the sensor outputs into a single and accurate data stream for use by motion applications. InvenSense delivers turn-key solutions with fully integrated MotionTracking devices, robust MotionFusion algorithms, and in-use calibration firmware. The company’s patented fabrication process is the key technology which enables direct integration of MEMS mechanical structures with CMOS electronics at the wafer level.
InvenSense MotionTracking technology is comprised of five core proprietary elements: the Fabrication process, advanced MEMS motion sensor designs, application specific mixed-signal circuitry for sensor signal processing, MotionFusion algorithms and calibration firmware that intelligently assimilates data from multiple sensors for use by end applications, and the MotionApps™ platform of drivers and application programming interfaces (APIs). Although all five elements are critical to providing a complete MotionProcessing solution, the patented Fabrication platform is the core differentiating technology. As a result of our modular and scalable platform architecture, our current and planned products span increasing levels of integration, from standalone single-chip gyroscopes to fully integrated sensor system on chip (SoC) MotionTracking solutions.
Founded in 2003, InvenSense is headquartered in San Jose, California and has offices in Boston, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, France, Canada, Slovakia and Italy.

Company Profile

InvenSense, a TDK Group company, is a world leading provider of MEMS sensor platforms found in Mobile, Wearables, Smart Home, Industrial, and Automotive products. The company’s patented Fabrication Platform, MotionFusion® technology, audio solutions, and location software and services addresses the emerging need of many mass-market consumer applications via improved performance, accuracy, and intuitive motion-, gesture- and sound-based interfaces.
In May of 2017, InvenSense became part of the MEMS Sensors Business Group within the newly formed Sensor Systems Business Company of TDK Corporation. TDK currently focuses on three market segments: automotive, industrial equipment & energy, and information & communications technology (ICT). As part of its strategy for growth in these key areas, TDK has identified sensors and actuators, energy units and next-generation electronic components as three product areas for strategic growth aimed at unlocking new business opportunities in the sphere of the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors are viewed as an important IoT-enabling technology, and sensor products and the technology portfolio of TDK will expand dramatically as a result of its acquisition of InvenSense.
MotionTracking solutions are rapidly becoming key functions in every consumer electronics device as it provides a more intuitive way for consumers to interact with their electronic devices by tracking their motions in free space and delivering these motions as input commands. Audio is similarly becoming complementary to motion as a means for interacting with contextually aware devices and applications. InvenSense’s vision is to be the leading provider of sensor Systems on Chips (SoC) platform solutions providing an ‘AlwaysOn’ solution by enabling the most seamless sensing experience at the lowest power.
InvenSense’s microphone portfolio builds on a strong heritage of industry firsts, including continuous improvement of MEMS microphone SNR, ever-higher integration levels, and even lower power consumption. InvenSense combines the capability to sense audio along with cutting-edge motion detection, which is important for many contextual awareness applications.
InvenSense’s MotionTracking portfolio of products and services accurately tracks complex user motions, requiring the use of motion sensors such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, compasses, and pressure sensors, properly calibrating the data, and then fusing the sensor outputs into a single and accurate data stream for use by motion applications. InvenSense delivers turn-key solutions with fully integrated MotionTracking devices, robust MotionFusion algorithms, and in-use calibration firmware. The company’s patented fabrication process is the key technology which enables direct integration of MEMS mechanical structures with CMOS electronics at the wafer level.
InvenSense MotionTracking technology is comprised of five core proprietary elements: the Fabrication process, advanced MEMS motion sensor designs, application specific mixed-signal circuitry for sensor signal processing, MotionFusion algorithms and calibration firmware that intelligently assimilates data from multiple sensors for use by end applications, and the MotionApps™ platform of drivers and application programming interfaces (APIs). Although all five elements are critical to providing a complete MotionProcessing solution, the patented Fabrication platform is the core differentiating technology. As a result of our modular and scalable platform architecture, our current and planned products span increasing levels of integration, from standalone single-chip gyroscopes to fully integrated sensor system on chip (SoC) MotionTracking solutions.
Founded in 2003, InvenSense is headquartered in San Jose, California and has offices in Boston, China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, France, Canada, Slovakia and Italy.

                How InvenSense Inc. Performed in 2016            


    By Shoshanna Delventhal | January 2, 2017 — 2:27 PM EST    






Share















































Shares of San Jose, Calif.-based semiconductor manufacturer InvenSense Inc. (INVN) rose 33% over the course of 2016, closing on Dec. 30 at a price of $12.79.
Most of the increase in InvenSense’s share price can be attributed to the most recent one-month period in which the chipmaker saw its stock surge over 77% after an announcement that it would be acquired by Japan’s TDK Corp. The tech firm will be taken over by the Tokyo-based chipmaker in a deal with $1.3 billion, integrating InvenSense’s strength in mobile with TDK’s battery, automotive, and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses. (See also: Japan’s TDK to Acquire InvenSense for $1.3 Billion.)
InvenSense Attempts to Diversify
Throughout 2016, the U.S. chipmaker had attempted to diversify its products and wean itself off of its main smartphone customers, including Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics. In early December, InvenSense announced a deal with the fourth-largest smartphone provider in the world, Chinese-based OPPO, to enhance its latest R9S and R9S Plus smartphone videos.
The firm has also recently targeted growth in the wearable technology space, offering micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) sensors and electronic imagine stabilization solutions for products such as fitness trackers, smartphones, watches and new augmented and virtual reality devices.
CEO Foresees a Strong Top Line
In the firm’s most recent fiscal 2017 second-quarter earnings report in early November, InvenSense posted revenues that met expectations, though earnings fell short of the Street’s estimates. Investors were disappointed in lower-than-expected earnings, which the firm attributed to a weakened smartphone and consumer market. InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi remained confident regarding investments in R&D to drive future penetration in new markets, positioning the firm for “strong top line growth in fiscal 2018” as the firm “strives to diversity” its business.
TDK’s acquisition of InvenSense protects the firm from a lack of customer and product diversification, while the Japanese firm will use the U.S. chipmaker to bolster its position in the sensor segment.

TDK Completes Acquisition of InvenSense




Becomes a Leading Global Sensor Solutions Provider






May 18, 2017 10:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



TOKYO & SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TDK Corporation (President and CEO: Shigenao Ishiguro, “TDK”) and 
      InvenSense, Inc. (President and CEO: Behrooz Abdi, “InvenSense”) 
      announce that TDK has completed the all-cash acquisition of InvenSense.
    

      The acquisition price was $13.00 USD per InvenSense share, and the total 
      acquisition price was approximately $1.3 billion USD.
    

      TDK currently focuses on three market segments: automotive, industrial 
      equipment & energy, and information & communications technology (ICT). 
      As part of its strategy for growth in these key areas, TDK has 
      identified sensors and actuators, energy units and next-generation 
      electronic components as three product areas for strategic growth aimed 
      at unlocking new business opportunities in the sphere of the Internet of 
      Things (IoT). Sensors are viewed as an important IoT-enabling 
      technology, and sensor products and the technology portfolio of TDK will 
      expand dramatically as a result of its acquisition of InvenSense. TDK 
      will be able to create innovative next-generation products and provide a 
      new platform with sensor fusion that combines various sensor 
      technologies and software, so that it will be able to target more 
      business opportunities as a strong player capable of providing a broad 
      range of sensor solutions.
    

      TDK’s President and CEO, Mr. Shigenao Ishiguro, made the following 
      statement:
    

      “We are delighted to welcome InvenSense into the TDK Group. By merging 
      TDK’s strengths in magnetic sensor technologies, the extensive portfolio 
      of sensor products from TDK Group’s EPCOS, TDK-Micronas and Tronics with 
      InvenSense’s leading sensor and software platforms, we will be able to 
      bolster TDK’s sensor business, one of our strategic growth areas. We aim 
      to become a global leader in the sensor business, which will be a key 
      component of the future growth of TDK.”
    

      As a result of the completed acquisition, InvenSense will become a 
      wholly owned subsidiary of TDK, and Mr. Behrooz Abdi will continue to 
      lead InvenSense as its CEO; additionally serving as General Manager of 
      MEMS Sensors Business Group of Sensor Systems Business Company within 
      the newly formed Sensor Systems Business Company of TDK.

InvenSense, Inc. Announces Offer to Purchase Any And All of Its Outstanding 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018 | Business Wire
























































InvenSense, Inc. Announces Offer to Purchase Any And All of Its 
      Outstanding 1.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018






June 14, 2017 04:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--InvenSense, Inc. (“InvenSense”), a TDK Group company and leading 
      provider of MEMS sensor platforms, announced that it has commenced an 
      offer (the “Offer”) to purchase any and all of its outstanding 
      $175 million aggregate principal amount of 1.75% Convertible Senior 
      Notes due 2018 (CUSIP No. 46123DAB2) (the “Notes”) on July 18, 
      2017 (the “Fundamental Change Purchase Date”). Tenders of the 
      Notes must be made prior to the expiration of the Offer at 5:00 p.m., 
      New York City time, on July 17, 2017 (the “Expiration Time”), and 
      may be withdrawn at any time prior to the Expiration Time, through 
      compliance with the proper procedures outlined in the Fundamental Change 
      Notice and Offer to Purchase (the “Offer to Purchase”).
    


      Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer to Purchase, 
      for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not 
      validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, InvenSense will pay, in cash, 
      $1,000 plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the 
      Fundamental Change Purchase Date.
    

      Alternatively, in connection with the merger (the “Merger”), 
      through which InvenSense became a wholly owned subsidiary of TDK U.S.A. 
      Corporation (“TDK”), each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes is 
      convertible until the Expiration Time into cash in an amount equal to 
      the conversion rate for the Notes (45.6830 shares of InvenSense common 
      stock) multiplied by the merger consideration ($13.00 per share), or 
      $593.879.
    

      The right of holders of Notes to participate in the Offer to Purchase is 
      separate from the right to convert their Notes. Once Notes have been 
      converted, they may not be tendered in the Offer. Notes that have been 
      tendered in the Offer may only be converted if such Notes are validly 
      withdrawn prior to the Expiration Time in accordance with the terms of 
      the Offer.
    

      The Offer commenced today, June 14, 2017, and will expire at the 
      Expiration Time.
    

      None of InvenSense’s or TDK’s respective directors, officers, employees, 
      affiliates, advisors, agents or representatives is making any 
      representation or recommendation to any holder of Notes as to whether or 
      not to tender or convert such holder’s Notes. Holders of Notes must 
      decide how many Notes they will tender or convert, if any. The terms and 
      conditions of the Offer are described in the Offer to Purchase.
    

      THIS PRESS RELEASE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND DOES NOT 
      CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO BUY OR THE SOLICITATION OF AN OFFER TO SELL THE 
      NOTES. THE OFFER IS BEING MADE ONLY PURSUANT TO THE OFFER TO PURCHASE 
      THAT INVENSENSE HAS DISTRIBUTED TO HOLDERS OF ITS NOTES. HOLDERS OF 
      NOTES SHOULD READ THE OFFER TO PURCHASE CAREFULLY PRIOR TO MAKING ANY 
      DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFER BECAUSE IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT 
      INFORMATION, INCLUDING THE VARIOUS TERMS OF THE OFFER. HOLDERS OF NOTES 
      MAY OBTAIN A FREE COPY OF THE OFFER TO PURCHASE BY CONTACTING D.F. KING 
      & CO., INC., AT (212) 269-5550 OR TOLL-FREE AT (800) 969-5084 OR VIA 
      EMAIL AT INVN@DFKING.COM.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
