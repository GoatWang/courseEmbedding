"I knew killers. My uncle, who took care of me, murdered people, and yet he took care of me too. People who have gone to jail for murder are also human.”Lee DanielsSynopsisLee Daniels was born December 24, 1959 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is known for producing films that tackle such thorny issues as race, image, family violence, and sex. Along the way he's shown that these stories can succeed at the box office. His critically acclaimed 2002 hit, Monster's Ball, was not only an Oscar winner, but turned a $2.5 million production into a $31 million success.Early LifeFilm producer, director. Born December 24, 1959, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Lee Daniels is known for his uncompromising work, producing films that tackle such thorny issues as race, image, family violence, and sex. Along the way he's shown that these stories can have success at the box office. His critically acclaimed 2002 hit, Monster's Ball, was not only an Oscar winner, but turned a $2.5 million production into a $31 million success. Daniels was born far away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. The oldest of five children born to Clara and William Daniels, Lee Daniels grew up in West Philadelphia. His dad, a cop who had once worked as a bodyguard for Muhammad Ali and was killed in a robbery when his oldest boy was just 12, could be hard on his children, especially Daniels, whose early signs of his homosexuality didn't exactly sit well with him. But beyond the physical abuse William Daniels sometimes brought to the household, there was another side to him, one that centered on a deep appreciation for books and poetry. He had a passion for reading, and wrote his own short stories and poetry. "Anything artistic I got, I got from him," Daniels has said. Despite the obvious strain William Daniels placed on his relationship with his children, Lee Daniels says he clearly loved his dad, and his shocking death was difficult to overcome, much less understand.Career in HealthcareAfter high school, Daniels headed off to St. Louis, Missouri, to attend the small liberal arts school, Lindenwood College. He wanted to study theater and film, but it wasn't long before he grew frustrated with academics. Just before the start of his junior year, dropped out. He packed up his things again and, with just $7 in his pocket a lot of ambition, moved to Los Angeles to make it as a writer. He didn't have much luck finding work in Hollywood, however. Instead, to make ends meet, Daniels took a job as a receptionist at a nursing agency. Within a short time, Daniels was part of management, then started his own nursing agency out of his home. It wasn't what Daniels had moved out to Hollywood to do, but soon his five-person nursing staff had grown to 500 and he was heading up a company worth several million dollars. As it would be with his later film work, there was a bit of a pioneering spirit behind Daniels' healthcare career. In addition to working with the American Heart & Lung Associations and the American Sickle Cell Anemia Association, his company became the first of its kind in the country to land a contract with the AIDS Project Los Angeles.Making it in HollywoodBut Daniels hadn't completely abandoned his dream of working in Hollywood. By chance, a client of his was also a producer who had worked with Prince. The two got to talking one Saturday morning and, when Daniels told him what his real career ambitions were, the producer told him he could help him find a job. And so, at the age of 22, Daniels sold his agency, pocketed several million dollars, and started a new career as a production assistant. His focus soon became casting, and he eventually found himself working on big-name projects likeUnder the Cherry Moon and Purple Rain. In 1984, Daniels, frustrated by the lack of meaty roles available to proven African-American actors, yet again showed his ambition and drive by striking out on his own. He formed Lee Daniels Entertainment, a New York City-based management company whose clients would eventually include some of the biggest names in Hollywood, from Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Hilary Swank to Morgan Freeman and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. Daniels' foray into movie-making with the creation of Monster's Ball came about after several conversations with Sean Penn about the film. The story, which is centered on a complicated bi-racial romance, had seen more than a few stops and starts as different directors—first Penn, and later Oliver Stone—tried to make a movie out of it. Fascinated by the tale, and frustrated at all the obstacles, Daniels took control of the project himself. He turned to Swiss-born director Marc Foster to lead the movie, and convinced enough A-list talent—Halle Berry and Bill Bob Thornton, among others—to do the film for little money. The result was an unabashed success, getting a Best Writing nomination at the 2002 Academy Awards, and making Berry the first African-American woman to win a Best Actress Oscar. In addition, the movie made Daniels the first African-American to solely produce an Academy Award-nominated film.Mainstream SuccessDaniels wasted little time basking in the accolades. In 2004 he produced his next film, The Woodsman, a haunting tale about the tormented life of a child molester who was released from prison. The film, starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick and Mos Def, earned more acclaim and more awards for Daniels. Two years later, audiences got a chance to see the result of Daniels' directorial work, with the release of Shadowboxer. Starring Helen Mirren, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Mo'Nique, Stephen Dorff, Vanessa Ferlito, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Macy Gray, the film tells the tale of a mother and her stepson who are also assassins. As it has been with much of his work, Daniel's personal biography factored into his initial attraction to the story. "Shadowboxer was based on my life," Daniels told The Times. "I knew killers. My uncle, who took care of me, murdered people, and yet he took care of me too. People who have gone to jail for murder are also human."'Precious'Daniels followed-up the crtically acclaimed film with Precious, the 2009 movie based on the novel Push, by Sapphire. The novel recounts the story of an overweight African-American girl and her attempts to break free from the violence that has shaped her life. "Ally Sheedy's mother gave me the book to read," Daniels recalled. "It blew me away, it rocked my soul, it stuck me to like hot grits. But the author at first wouldn't give me the rights to the book. I kept stalking her, and she finally gave me the book." The film, which co-stars Mariah Carey and Mo'Nique, was hardly a cookie-cutter operation. Because of the physical proportions demanded of the lead character, Daniels and his team had to look beyond Hollywood and most conventional casting methods to find a 350-pound African-American woman to play Claireece Precious Jones. They eventually found their woman in Gabourey Sidibe, a New York City resident who had no prior acting experience. Even then, however, the movie was far from an easy production. Daniels, who both produced and directed the film, fired staff. On a few occasions the film budget also dried up. At one point, Daniels had Carey give a private concert at his house to raise money from a group of prospective investors. The film was eventually finished, and the end product has only enhanced Daniels' stardom. At Sundance, Precious earned three awards, including the Grand Jury Prize, and also took home the People's Choice award at the Toronto Film Festival, the event's highest honor. With success has come criticism, and Daniels' movies have drawn concern, and sometimes ire, from film critics about his portrayal of African-American characters. Precious is no exception. In the film, the lead character contracts AIDS from her father, which serves to only reinforce certain stereotypes, critics counter, about the black community and black women in general. Daniels doesn't see it that way. "Black women are dying because everyone wants to pretend to have a certain image," he told reporters shortly after the movie's release in the fall of 2009. "Most of the AIDS patients in this country are black women. For me to portray and not tell my truth and bring it to the screen would be an injustice to me as a man—forget about a black man, but as a man. I would be lying and black women are dying."Recent Projects and Personal LifeAll of which points to how Daniels has been careful to leverage his celebrity and power for causes he believes in. In 2004, for example, he teamed up with former President Clinton on a series of public service productions to encourage young African-Americans to vote. Daniels has continued to make engaging and challenging films. In 2012, he directed The Paperboy with Zac Efron and Nicole Kidman. The movie gained some notoriety for a risque scene featuring its two lead actors. Daniels then created a truly American epic with The Butler (2013), which looks a series of presidents through the people who served them. The star-studded cast includes Forest Whitaker and Oprah Winfrey. Made for less than $30 million, The Butler has brought in more than $115 million domestically. There is also substantial buzz around the film and its performances about possible Academy Award nominations. For his next project, Daniels wanted to tackle the life of rock legend Janis Joplin. As he told The Hollywood Reporter, "I had no idea Janis Joplin was so smart—intellectual, even. Look, some of the smartest people in the world have been drug addicts." Amy Adams stars as the late singer. Daniels is confident that Adams has the vocal talent to pull off such a challenging role. While his Janis Joplin project ran into some delays, Daniels found time to create a hit television series. He is the co-creator of Empire, a drama that looks the family involved with a successful music company. Daniels has also written and directed some of the show's episodes. In the series, Terrence Howard plays Lucious Lyon, head of the music label and the family. He must decide who will take over his business after he learns that he is dying. His ex-wife Cookie (Taraji Henson) also wants a share of the business. The series' first 13 episodes aired in early 2015 to stellar ratings.  A resident of New York City, Daniels lives with his partner, casting director Billy Hopkins, and his twin daughters, Clara and Liam, whom he adopted from his brother in 1996.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

Lee Daniels On Taking The Comfort Out of Primetime TV with ‘STAR’
With his new Fox drama, Lee Daniels aims to address the grit and grime he endured on his come-up while also exploring race "in a way we haven't seen before"

Empire co-creator Lee Daniels


Lee Daniels wanted to shake-up network television. “I think we’ve gotten too politically correct with primetime. We’re just not in your face anymore. You can go to cable for that,” he tells EBONY.com while on the set of his second FOX series, STAR.
Daniels has an anxious demeanor and it’s obvious that the writer, producer and director has one-thousand thoughts floating through his mind as he skips from one idea to the next. But, even with the immediate success of Empire, and the risks taken that led to its gasp-worthy moments, Daniels is nervous about the reception of what he’s bringing to viewers next.
“Do you think people are going to like it,” he asks in a slight whisper referencing STAR, a drama based in Atlanta and centering on three aspiring singers. “I really want to explore race in a way that we haven’t seen it before on a network series.”
And he does–in a sense.
Daniels’ exploration of race in a “new light” is bringing the lead character of STAR, a White girl (Jude Demorest), into a Black environment and observing what that’s like on a national viewing scale. His reasoning goes a bit more in-depth, however.

“We are in a very dangerous state right now in our country and I wanted White people to feel good about being White because right now, there’s a lot of hatred going on,” Daniels explains before further detailing the story he created. “It started out with this White girl that was just badass and would do anything: kill, rob, have sex, whatever to get to the top. Then, I realized as I was writing, that it was more about a girl group. Their whole world is about what happened to me when I left home and went to Hollywood and the struggles I went through. ”
Star (Demorest) and Simone (Brittany O’Grady) are sisters who were separated and entered into the foster care system after their mother’s death. Alexandra’s (Ryan Destiny), life experience is the total opposite of her singing counterparts. She’s the daughter of a rockstar (Lenny Kravitz), flaunting luxurious style with an attitude to match on the Upper East Side of New York City, who’s running from her father’s wealth. She links with the sisters in hopes of finding her identity and building a music career.

The series, which aired as a special presentation back in December, touches on the foster care system, prejudices within the Black community, and enters the world of the transgender community via the storyline of Amiyah Scott who plays “Cotton”, the daughter of Carlotta played by Queen Latifah.
“I think Empire has paved a way for me to bust open the door with this transgender issue that even I don’t understand and I’m gay,” Daniels says.
He takes a deep breath as he recalls a dark scene in the first episode that shows Cotton being attacked in an alley. “I was just trying to tell the truth and figure out how I do I tell this story and the pain of what she’s had to go through to become her from a very young age. It makes my trashcan story look like Disneyland,” he says referencing an early episode of Empire.
STAR packs on the grit and hustle while weaving in spiritual elements, too.
We meet Carlotta, a beauty shop owner that very much becomes its own character in the drama, at church, leading the choir as she belts out, “I’ve been way too low for way too long.” Carlotta speaks with intent, but it’s her eyes that do most of the talking. It’s evident that she’s been through the rough and is working constantly to stay out of it.
Though she’s Cotton’s mother, when Star, Simone and Alexandria step foot in her church, Carlotta’s nurturing and protective instincts are kicked up to a higher degree.
“It’s always a tricky line between Carlotta and those three girls. Cotton’s ass is slick too,” Latifah says. “I think one of the best things about Carlotta is that she has a lot of baggage and it’s not current. She’s a constant work in progress. She’s ‘bout it, bout it’, but she’s really trying to stay on the right side of things. But she’s always prepared, you know what I mean?”

Many have likened the show to a spin-off of Empire, the common denominators are indeed music and drama, but escapism serves as an undertone of the new series and “rich” is only an idea in the lives of all characters involved.
“This is some other type of sh–,” Daniels laughs.
Season 1 of STAR  kicks off tonight, 9/8C on Fox.

Cotton’s ass is slick too,” Latifah says. “I think one of the best things about Carlotta is that she has a lot of baggage and it’s not current. She’s a constant work in progress. She’s ‘bout it, bout it’, but she’s really trying to stay on the right side of things. But she’s always prepared, you know what I mean?”

Many have likened the show to a spin-off of Empire, the common denominators are indeed music and drama, but escapism serves as an undertone of the new series and “rich” is only an idea in the lives of all characters involved.
“This is some other type of sh–,” Daniels laughs.
Season 1 of STAR  kicks off tonight, 9/8C on Fox.

Lee Daniels will return as director of the upcoming Jay Z-produced Richard Pryor biopic, Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said?. Weinstein Company head Harvey Weinstein announced the news at a press conference Thursday. Related

Jay Z and Weinstein were on hand to discuss their upcoming Spike TV docuseries about Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old who was imprisoned on Rikers Island for three years without conviction and later took his own life after his release. Later in the press conference, Weinstein touched on Is It Something I Said?, which Daniels left in May. At the time, there were no specific reasons given for Daniels' departure, nor did Weinstein discuss why the director was able to return at the press conference."I can tell you that Jay is going to produce the Richard Pryor movie with Lee Daniels directing," Weinstein said. "Each time, I think you'll see these projects be something that hit the cultural zeitgeist. One day we'll find something really commercial now to do. But not now."Jay then jumped in, first chiding Weinstein by noting, "You don't get more commercial [than Pryor]," then discussing the comedian's vast influence. "His story is an American story," the rapper said. "You'll understand how many lives he's touched, from every single comedian to rappers like Biggie Smalls, who I won't recite the lyric because we've got Ms. Browder in the audience. But y'all know the lyrics." (On "Me and My Bitch," Biggie paraphrased Pryor's "Wino and Junkie" routine with the line, "You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick.")Richard Pryor: Is It Something I Said? will star Mike Epps as the comedian, Eddie Murphy as his abusive father, LeRoy "Buck Carter" Pryor, and Oprah Winfrey as his brothel-running grandmother, Marie Carter. Kate Hudson has also signed on to play Pryor's fourth (and, after divorcing and then remarrying, seventh and final) wife, Jennifer Lee Pryor, while Oscar-winner Bill Condon (Dreamgirls, Kinsey, Chicago) is writing the script.Additional reporting by Kory Grow

89) Which stakeholders must companies satisfy? What role should stakeholders play in a firm’s internal code of conduct?
Answer:  Stakeholders include stockholders, employees, customers, and society at large. In the short term, the aims of these groups conflict. Stockholders want additional sales and increased productivity, which result in higher profits and larger returns going to them. Employees want additional compensation. Customers want lower prices. And society at large would like to see increased corporate taxes or corporate involvement in social functions. In the long term, all of these aims must be achieved adequately, or none will be attained at all because each stakeholder group is powerful enough to cause the company’s demise. When developing an internal code of conduct, firms need to communicate company policies to employees, suppliers, and subcontractors to ensure that everyone involved understands what behavior is acceptable. External stakeholders should receive reports of how the code of conduct is functioning.

90) What is the difference between relativism and normativism? How do these concepts relate to ethical behavior in international business?
Answer:  Relativism affirms that ethical truths depend on the groups holding them. This makes intervention by outsiders unethical. The idea of relativism can be expressed by the statement “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.” Normativism holds that there are universal standards of behavior (based on people’s own values) that all cultures should follow, making nonintervention unethical. Managers thus struggle with implementing a “universal” set of truths versus adapting to local conditions on the assumption that every place is different and should be treated differently. Often, a company faces certain pressures to comply with local norms. These may take the form of laws that permit—or even require—only certain practices that grant competitive advantages to firms accepting local norms while throwing up roadblocks in front of companies that try to impose home-country practices in the local arena. Conversely, firms may face certain pressures not to comply from its home-country government, or even from constituencies that threaten retaliatory action if it submits to objectionable foreign practices.

91) Explain why the argument that “anything that is legal is ethical” is insufficient.
Answer:

The law is not appropriate for regulating all business activity because not everything that is unethical is illegal.
The law is slow to develop in emerging areas of concern. Laws take time to be legislated and tested in courts. Further, they cannot anticipate all future ethical dilemmas; basically, they are a reaction to issues that have already surfaced.
The law often is based on moral concepts that are not precisely defined and that cannot be separated from legal concepts. Moral concepts must be considered along with legal ones.
The law is often in need of testing by the courts. This is especially true of case law, in which the courts establish precedent.
The law is not very efficient. Efficiency in this case implies achieving ethical behavior at a very low cost, and it would be impossible to solve every ethical behavioral problem with a law.

92) What is extraterritoriality? Why is the concept controversial?
Answer:  Extraterritoriality takes place when governments apply their laws to the foreign operations of their domestic companies. Laws vary from country to country, often because moral values vary from country to country. What some countries accept as illegal may not be considered as such by other countries. Strong governments can attempt to enforce their laws on their domestic companies operating in other countries. This has become very controversial and, as argued by some, inconsistent with increased globalization and the need to collaborate across national boundaries.

93) What types of payments are legal and illegal under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of the United States? Provide an example.
Answer:  Payments to officials to expedite otherwise legitimate transactions (officially called “facilitation payments” but sometimes referred to as “speed money” or “grease money”) are legal, but payments to other officials who are not directly responsible for carrying out the transaction are not. Facilitation payments take many forms. For example, payment to a customs official to clear legitimate merchandise is legal, whereas a payment to a government minister to influence the customs official is illegal. The FCPA allows the former payment because governmental officials in many countries delay compliance of laws indefinitely until they do receive payments, even though such payments may be illegal in those countries.

Skill:  Application
Objective:  2

94) What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act? How has this law affected ethical behavior among international businesses?
Answer:  The FCPA outlaws bribery payments by U.S. firms to foreign officials, political parties, political officials, and political candidates. According to the act, it is illegal to make payments to government officials to directly engage in illegal activity to benefit the briber. However, it is possible for U.S. companies to make facilitating payments to foreign government officials to expedite legitimate transactions, in other words, doing what they should be doing, not doing something wrong. The FCPA is directed toward U.S. companies operating abroad, although the provisions of the FCPA were extended in 1998 to include bribery by foreign firms operating in the United States or one of its territories. The U.S. government and other governments worldwide are starting to crack down harder on bribery. Governments want to ensure that individual and corporate behavior are consistent with the best interest of the broader community and also want to be sure that laws are being followed.

95) What ethical and labor-related issues are a major challenge to footwear and clothing MNEs that operate in developing countries? What guidelines are provided by the Ethical Trading Initiative?
Answer:  The many labor issues that companies must deal with include fair wages, child labor, working conditions, working hours, and freedom of association. These issues are especially critical in retail, clothing, footwear, and agriculture where MNEs outsource production to independent companies abroad, usually in developing countries. The challenge for MNEs is that they work in an environment with different cultural, legal, and political rules than what they are used to in their home countries. The objective of ETI is to get companies to adopt ethical employment policies and then monitor compliance with their overseas suppliers. ETI’s trading initiative base code identifies the following issues:

Employment is freely chosen.
Freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining are respected.
Working conditions are safe and hygienic.
Child labor shall not be used.
Living wages are paid.
Working hours are not excessive.
No discrimination is practiced.
Regular employment is provided.
No harsh or inhumane treatment is allowed.

96) What motivations do companies have to act responsibly? How can codes of conduct help firms to act ethically?
Answer:

Unethical and irresponsible behavior could result in legal sanctions, especially in the areas of bribery and product safety.
Unethical and irresponsible behavior could also result in consumer boycotts.
Unethical behavior can affect employee morale. Good behavior can positively influence both the workers in the developing countries as well as those in corporate headquarters back home who are proud of their company’s behavior.
Companies never know when bad publicity is going to cost them sales.

A major component of most companies’ strategies for ethical and socially responsible behavior is a code of conduct. External codes of conduct are useful only insofar as they give companies some general guidance on how to operate. The practical challenge for the company is familiarizing itself with the codes of many different organizations and using them to fashion its own internal code of conduct. A code of conduct that is clearly communicated to all employees, suppliers, and subcontractors should provide global policies that help guide decisions.

97) How have sustainability demands and the Kyoto Protocol affected international business? Discuss the controversies surrounding each.
Answer:  Sustainability refers to the concept of meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Proponents of the concept argue that sustainability considers what’s best for both people and the environment. However, the concept is controversial because sustainability can be interpreted differently by environmentalists and businesspeople. The Kyoto Protocol, which requires the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases, has not been adopted by all countries and is therefore still limited in its total global impact. However, companies must adapt to countries that have implemented the Protocol. Countries that have not signed the Kyoto Protocol argue that the mandatory restrictions may reduce economic growth.

98) How can an MNE operating in a developing country have a positive influence on labor policies? Illustrate your answer with an example.
Answer:  MNEs operating in countries with very different labor policies succumb to the pressure to simply leave the market. Usually, this turns out to be a shortsighted decision. Research shows, for instance, that companies like Nike have substantially improved the conditions of workers in overseas facilities. Granted, MNEs are in no position to revolutionize the employment practices of the countries in which they operate, but they can improve conditions at subcontract facilities and even influence the guidelines set by other foreign investors. In the case of IKEA, carpets make up a small percentage of sales, and it would have been easy to simply give up the product line and move out of India. But officials at IKEA felt a responsibility to the children and decided to do as much as possible to make a difference. As IKEA got more involved in India, it set up the IKEA Foundation and partnered with UNICEF, contributing over $190 million in cash and in-kind donations to UNICEF programs to help children and their families. IKEA’s work with UNICEF went beyond the issues of the supply chain and moved more into the humanitarian aspect of how to help the children. The IKEA Foundation targets South Asia, especially India, because of its supply chain issues, but it also targets that region because of the tremendous need that exists to help the children.

From the fabric to the construction, Lee jeans are made with longevity and style in mind. Do yourself a favor and check out the results of this hard-earned heritage, including pants, shorts, and all types of denim that come in every style and wash under the sun!

Grab a pair of classic-fit jeans that both flatter your figure while keeping you comfy all day long.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
