                                Report abuseTranscript of Emmett TillEmmett Tillemmett TIllhistorical context -President Eisenhower was in office during this time- In Chicago's Democratic primary, Mayor Martin H. Kennelly loses to the head of the Cook County Democratic Party, Richard J. Daleybackground -Born on July 25th, 1941 at the Cook County Public Hospital in Chicago -While growing up, his dad was mostly absent from his life(he was executed by the U.S. army for the rape of two women, and the murder of another) events-On August 20th, 1955 Emmett went down south to Mississipi for a two month visit with his cousins in a town called Money-In the evening of the 24th, Emmett and five of his realatives and friends went to Bryant's Grocery and Meat Market background-Mamie(Emmett's mom) described her life with "Bo" at her mother's house in downtown Chicago as being "as close to perfect as you could get"-Emmett had a stutter due to having polio whe he was youngerhistorical context -Lady and the Tramp, Walt Disney's 15th animated film, premieres in Chicago, Illinois-Ray Kroc opens his first McDonald's in Des Plaines, Illinois-February 24 – Steve Jobs, entrepreneur and inventor was born events -Emmett was left alone in the store for just a moment with the cashier, Carolyn Bryant, before his cousin entered the store-Bryant claimed that Emmett asked for some candy inside the candy counter and when she placed it on the counter, he grabbed her hand tightlyevents-When Emmett grabbed her hand, Bryant claimed that he said "How about a date baby?'-Bryant tried to walk away but said that Emmett grabbed her waist and told her, "You needn't be afraid of me baby, I've slept with white women before"events -Carolyn Bryant left the store and went to her car to retieve what she later testified to be a gun when Emmett whistled at her, apaulled at his behavior, Bryant told otherrs of the incident, and her husband soon heard the news when returning to town on the 27th after hauling shrimpmurder -Roy Bryant aggressively questioned the black men in the town to find out who had harassed his wife-He soon found out that he was from Chicago and was staying with Mose Wright(Emmett's uncle)murder-Several people over heard Roy planning to take Emmett from Wright's house-On Sunday, August 28, 1955, early in the morning,Roy Bryant, Milam, and another man drove to Wright's house and took Emmett and put him in the back of a pick up truck murder-They drove Emmett to several different locations(a barn, a shed, a river) and continuously beat him until finally shooting him -They continued to drive around with Emmetts body in their truck until people questioned the blood on the truck murder-Roy and his gang finally anchored Emmett's body to the bottom of a river with a fan-Emmett's family, unaware of what had happened had contacted the police in order to find Emmett -Roy and his friends were arrested for kidnapping murder-Three days after his death, Emmett's body was found by two boys fishing almost unecognizable funeral and reaction -The circumstances surrounding Emmett Till grew beyond the details of a 14-year-old boy who had unknowingly defied a severe social caste system. Till's murder brought considerations about segregation, law enforcement, and relations between the North and Southfuneral and reaction -One newspaper red, "Now is the time for every citizen who loves the state of Mississippi to 'Stand up and be counted' before hoodlum white trash brings us to destruction."-Emmett's body was sent back to Chicago for a proper burial in his hometown funeral and reaction -Emmett's mother decided to have an open casket funeral, saying "There was just no way I could describe what was in that box. No way. And I just wanted the world to see."-Tens of thouusandss attended his funeral because they were outraged at his deathtrial-Bryant and Milam were indicted for murder-David Halberstam called the trial "the first great media event of the civil rights movement"trial-The trial was held in September 1955, lasting for five days; and attendees remember the weather being very hot. The courtroom was filled to its 280-spectator capacity, and as a matter of course racially segregatedtrial-The defense's primary strategy was arguing that the body pulled from the river could not be positively identified and they questioned whether Till was dead at all. The defense asserted that Bryant and Milam had taken Till, but had let him go, also that Wright could not positivley identify Roy amd Milamtrial-Only three outcomes were possible in Mississippi for capital murder: life imprisonment, the death penalty, or acquittal. On September 23 the jury acquitted both defendants after a 67-minute deliberationtrial-Many argued that because the jurors were from the same area as Roy and Milam, that they had they same views/hatred against african americans, making it an unfair trial trial -In later interviews, the jurors acknowledged that they knew Bryant and Milam were guilty, but simply did not believe life imprisonment or the death penalty fit punishment for whites who had killed a black manmedia -Reactions from newspapers in major international cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications were furious about the verdict and very critical of American societymedia -Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, wrote that the court system had done its jobmedia-In an interview for a magazine, Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them thought of themselves as guilty or that they had done anything wrong. Following their interview, however, their support base eroded in Mississippi, and their store went bankrupt influence-Them admitting to killing Till caused prominent civil rights leaders to push the federal government harder to investigate the case. Till's murder was one of several reasons the Civil Rights Act of 1957 was passedinfluence -Langston Hughes dedicated an untitled poem (eventually to be known as "Mississippi—1955") to Till in his October 1, 1955 column in The Chicago Defender. It was reprinted across the country and continued to be republished with various changes from different writersinfluence-Harper Lee published To Kill a Mockingbird in which a white attorney is committed to defending a black man named Tom Robinson, accused of raping a white woman. Lee, whose novel had a profound effect on civil rights, has not publicly stated influence...Robinson's origins, but literature professor Patrick Chura notes several compelling similarities between Till's case and that of Robinson-Bob Dylan recorded a song titled "The Death of Emmett Till" in 1962lasting legacy "I realized that Emmett had achieved the significant impact in death that he had been denied in life. Even so, I had never wanted Emmett to be a martyr. I only wanted him to be a good son. Although I realized all the great things that had been accomplished lasting legacy...largely because of the sacrifices made by so many people, I found myself wishing that somehow we could have done it another way."-Mamie Till-Mobley key peopleroy bryant miliam key peoplecarolyn bryant mose wrightFull transcriptMore presentations by
