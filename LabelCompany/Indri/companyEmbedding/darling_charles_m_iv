			Principal Occupation:President of DQ Holdings, L.L.C.    Business Experience:Mr. Darling has served as President of DQ Holdings, L.L.C., a venture capital investment and consulting firm focused primarily on opportunities in the energy industry and on the development and sale of medical devices and other manufactured products, since August 1998. Mr. Darling was previously the General Manager of Desert Power, LP and of its general partner, Desert Power, LLC, which was an indirect affiliate of DQ Holdings, L.L.C. In late 2006, Desert Power, LLC and Desert Power, LP, along with certain of their subsidiaries, filed for bankruptcy in Nevada. In late 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the plan of reorganization, which became final in accordance with its terms in early 2008. Mr. Darling also previously practiced law at the law firm of Baker Botts, L.L.P. for over 20 years.     Qualifications:Mr. Darling has significant experience addressing financial, legal, regulatory and risk matters affecting HLS and HEP. His service as a partner of a major international law firm practicing energy law, as President and General Counsel of a publicly traded energy company with a publicly traded pipelines master limited partnership and his subsequent endeavors in the energy industry as President of an investment and development firm provide him with valuable insight into our industry. Mr. Darling's leadership skills, management and legal experience make him particularly well suited to be our Presiding Director.
