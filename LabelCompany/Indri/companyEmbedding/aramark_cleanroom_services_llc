You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Industry Information


Clean Rooms
Clean rooms are enclosures designed to facilitate sensitive research, fabrication and other operations that must take place in the absence of dust, moisture and other airborne contaminants. Clean rooms systems were first developed in response to the needs of the aerospace and microtechnology industries in the early 1960s. As those and other high-tech disciplines like bio-technology and medical research developed, and as products and research subjects became smaller, airborne contaminants became increasingly disruptive. The rigidly controlled environments with which these professionals began to surround their work came to be known as clean rooms.
All clean room designs are intended to provide a workspace in which factors like airborne dust, variable air temperature and pressures, moisture and other atmospheric conditions can be carefully controlled. All of the different possible clean room constructions allow professionals a range of workspace possibilities. They range from strict Class 100 clean rooms to less rigidly controlled portable clean rooms and modular clean rooms. As more and more operations came to rely on clean rooms, regulatory authorities and standards-setting organizations classified clean rooms according to their capacity for removing contaminants. Class 1,000 clean rooms, for example, employ clean room supplies that are unlikely to release fibrous contaminants. The standards for clean room equipment used in Class 10,000 clean rooms are less strict; they can often feature soft walls and are used for less sensitive applications.
The measure of clean room cleanliness is the number of air pollutants that can be found in an air sample. Many clean rooms are not intended to be completely sterile environments. More typically, professionals concern themselves with the amount of dust floating in the air or that can be kicked up from the floor when stepped on. This dust is microscopic and can sometimes only be measured by specialized machinery. There are some cases in which sterility is a requirement; many medical research operations and testing procedures must be conducted in a sterile environment. Pharmacological studies, infectious disease testing and other highly sensitive medical research-related procedures often require the complete evacuation of any microbes that may be present in their surrounding environments. Clean room cleanliness is determined based on the presence of contaminants over 0.5 micrometers in size. A human hair is usually around 100 micrometers wide, and humans shed dead skin cells at a rapid rate of 100,000 particles per minute while standing still. For these reasons, very little skin or hair, if any, is allowed to be exposed in clean room settings; they are both usually covered by protective clothing. Also, most clean rooms are equipped with some kind of air quality control system, many of which involve air filters and fans that remove air from within the clean room and pump filtered air in.
Clean room designs range in terms of size, material and their intended standard of cleanliness. Clean rooms used by major manufacturers of microelectronics, pharmaceutical products or circuitry can be as large as warehouses; these large clean rooms are sometimes referred to as "ballrooms." Other clean rooms can be as small as household ovens; these are used in small scale medical testing procedures as well as specialized, limited or exclusive-run manufacturing operations. They can also be used for repairs and for small experiments. Permanent clean rooms are usually built into the structures of the buildings that house them, as are the machines that regulate their conditions. However, some permanent clean rooms can be enclosed by glass or clear plastic walls. Soft walls, which are most commonly used in clean rooms with lower decontamination standards, are often made of flexible acrylic materials or other plastics. All of the materials used in the construction of clean rooms
must be carefully chosen for their non-fibrous, non static electricity-generating and non-corrosive qualities. Any material that could contribute to air contamination must be avoided during the construction of clean rooms. Even stainless steel can corrode when exposed to bleach, which is sometimes used as a disinfectant.
There are two main standards systems against which the cleanliness of a clean room is measured. US FED STD 209E is the system of standards set by the United States government; clean room models are assigned a class number based on the number of 0.5 micrometer-sized particles found in every cubic foot of atmosphere within the clean room. The class numbers correspond with the particle per cubic foot number. Class 1 clean rooms can be expected to contain one 0.5 micrometer-sized particle per square foot, Class 100 can be expected to contain 100 particles, and so on. If regular, unfiltered air were assigned a classification, it would be Class 1,000,000. The International Organization for Standardization also assigns standards to clean rooms based on their anticipated contaminant levels, though the ISO standards are assigned on a scale of three to eight, with three being assigned to the most effective clean room systems. The British Standard system is also recognized by some industries; their system measures contaminants in cubic meters instead of feet.

Everything You Need to Know about Cleanrooms
Given the requirements of modern-day equipment and devices, it is imperative for the manufacturing industry to get sophisticated. The cleanrooms that at one time had application in medical and scientific research industry, have become a norm in an array of industries. Cleanrooms now are a common sight in many manufacturing operations that process materials, which are sensitive to static electricity, dust, a multitude of micro-particles, and microorganisms. An industry that extensively uses cleanrooms is the semiconductor industry; semiconductors are sensitive to dust, and if a product is contaminated by dust, it can be rendered useless; therefore, the industry follows ISO cleanroom standards.
A cleanroom facility has a number of preventative devices, clean room equipment and materials to give a controlled environment that is free from dust and microorganisms. The equipment can be either for personal protection, or to have a germ- or dust-free air in the facility. The cost of personal gear and supplementary devices, such as highly efficient particulate air filters, air showers, and anti-static devices, is quite high. 
Here, we will discuss all the important information that you may need to make an informed decision about your cleanroom purchase.
How many types of cleanrooms are there?
Cleanrooms most commonly have applications in short-run production jobs and emergency work. For temporary means, cleanrooms are usually modular. It has a structure that can be assembled relatively in a small span of time for a specific work with suitable equipment, and when the structure had served its purpose, it is disassembled. Depending on the need, they can be assembled in existing facilities, like warehouses, as a separate work unit, and even outdoors, if it becomes necessary.
Most of the portable or temporary cleanrooms are softwall cleanrooms, which means they do not have rigid walls; instead, the walls are constructed from transparent polymers. Generally, modular cleanrooms are equipped with all the equipment that are found in permanent facilities, such as anti-static devices, small and portable HEPA filters, and garment change facilities.
They provide the same degree of sterility with almost half of the investment. However, they are designed to last for a minor period.
How cleanrooms are graded?
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) grades cleanrooms; the classification or grading is based on the number of particles, 0.1 micrometers or larger, permitted per cubic meter of air. There is a table standardized by ISO that defines various grading; for instance, an ISO 3 cleanrooms has maximum of 103 particles per meter cubed, or 1,000 particles. They are commonly known as Class 10000 Clean Rooms and Class 100 Clean Rooms, among others.
There are nine ISO classes, each having different permitted contaminant in the air, the lowest being, ISO Class 1, and the highest, ISO Class 9. 
ISO has written standards that you can access under following name:

Accessories for cleanrooms
Depending on the types of materials manufactured in a cleanroom, there is an array of accessories that are required for labor and other uses. In a computer parts manufacturing unit, all the workers in cleanroom need to wear anti-static garments and bracelet or anklet to prevent static current. Additional cleaning devices, cleanroom supplies and work benches are also installed, and standard equipment of laboratory and manufacturing must comply to clean standards.
Contamination Control of Clean Rooms - Key Factors
Clean rooms are especially designed enclosed area where the presence of airborne particles are regulated or controlled. Clean room equipment minimizes the generation, introduction, and retention of particles inside the room; moreover, controlled environment has specific temperature, humidity and pressure.
Maintaining a clean room can be a daunting task, therefore, here we are discussing the several areas of concern that gives insight into the overall picture of controlling contaminants. 
The following factors should be considered while deciding a contamination control program.

The architecture of clean rooms
Architecture of clean rooms are designed while keeping in mind the needs of a facility. The principal aim is to achieve and maintain an airflow that has uniform velocity that follows a parallel flow lines throughout the enclosed space-a uniform laminar flow.
The thumb rule is: the more restriction to air flow, the more turbulence it causes. Turbulence has been attributed to many contamination problems. According to ISO clean room standards, all clean room should have a well-designed space where airflow is not restricted in any way.
Filtration System
Almost all standards specify High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters as must equipment in clean rooms. These are indeed important, however, for low-grade clean rooms, like class 100 clean rooms a HVAC unit can be used as an alternative. Nevertheless, in Class 10000 Clean Rooms, HEPA air filters are necessary, as they filter very small particles with 99.97% efficiency.
Other than HEPA, there are a wide numbers of filtration mechanisms available; weigh in the price, advantages and installation cost before choosing an alternative to standard filtration system. 
Cleaning
In most clean rooms, cleaning is daily practice to maintain a degree of cleanliness based on the requirement. It is an important element of contamination control. Owners need to make decisions about maintenance, cleanroom supplies, and cleaning schedule. 

There are questions, compiled below, that will help you to make an effective cleaning program:

What is to be cleaned?
How the cleanliness is measured?
What cleaning materials or supplies should be used?
When to clean?
How frequently does one need to clean?

Maintaining a clean environment is a big task, it includes other factors too, such as garments, behavior of human in room, instruments, and physical structure. There are set standards for cleaning everything, visit ISO website to get the guidelines.
Sterile Clean Rooms
Clean rooms are commonly used for laboratory, medical, or software engineering applications. These clean rooms are designed to protect against dust, chemical vapors, airborne particles and other low level pollutants while maintaining a controlled temperature. The trick to a proper clean room is to control the air flow with the use of directional air filters that allow for a laminar air flow. By utilizing laminar flow it continuously cycles new filtered air into the clean environment to ensure no contaminates are lingering. 
There are four styles for measuring and classifying clean room cleanliness: US FED STD 209E, ISO 14644-1, BS 5295 and EMP EU. However the US FED STD 209E and ISO are the most commonly used. Classification of a clean room is based on the number of particles allowed in a particular amount of air. The amount of particles in a specific area is determined through the use of a discrete particle counting device. The standards are broken up into different "classes" and the larger the class number refers to a greater amount of particles permitted. For example an ISO Class 5 clean room allows for 100,000 particles per cubic meter. Also, an ISO Class 5 room is the equivalent of a Class 100 US FED STD 209E clean room. 
Only certain items are usually allowed into strict clean room environments. Personnel will typically wear clean room apparel that will not bring unwanted particles into the clean room. Items like face masks, bouffant caps, beard covers, shoe covers and even approved cleaning wipes are
required for clean rooms with limited permitted particles. Soft wall clean rooms can be utilized for applications that do have as sensitive materials. Clean rooms range in sizes as small as household
ovens or as big as warehouses.

Clean Room Types

Ballrooms are large-scale clean rooms.Class 100 clean rooms are Federal Standard 209 regulated and never exceed 100 particles per foot.Class 1000 clean rooms are Federal Standard 209 regulated and never exceed 1000 particles per foot.Class 10000 clean rooms are Federal Standard 209 regulated and never exceed 10000 particles per foot.Clean room equipment includes any tools, furniture, storage systems and work surfaces that are made specifically for use in clean rooms.Clean room systems consist of all components that make up a functioning clean room. Cleanroom construction companies manufacture custom or pre-designed clean rooms that fit all sorts of industry-specific standards.
Cleanroom design refers
		  to the type of design, including conventional, portable, hard wall modular,
		  and soft wall modular.

Cleanroom supplies include
		  products that aid in maintaining a sterile clean room.

Cleanrooms are areas where air content is strictly controlled.
Conventional clean rooms are generally permanent clean rooms and are
          the most common type.

Laminar flow clean rooms have filtration systems that control airflow
                and velocity to keep airborne particles from coming into contact
              with anything. 

Micro environments are clean areas constructed for semiconductor fabrication and other similar, sensitive fabrication processes. In micro environments, small clean areas are constructed around the wafer (or other project piece) itself
                  or around a part of the wafer to protect it from atmospheric
              exposure.

Mini environments are localized clean areas constructed around a
                  specific tool or part to prevent atmospheric
          exposure.

Modular cleanrooms are clean rooms that are assembled on-site from
                    pre-cut components (e.g. ceiling grid struts, walls, etc.).

Portable clean rooms are
		  transportable and self-contained.

Softwall cleanrooms have walls constructed either of fabric stretched
             tightly over a frame or of free-hanging strips of fabric.

Industry Information


Class 10000 Clean RoomsClass 10,000 clean rooms are rooms in which the concentration of 
airborne particles is never allowed to exceed 10,000 particles per cubic
 foot. The Class 10,000 designation and all the other airborne 
cleanliness classes in clean rooms and zones name their classes after 
the maximum number of particles allowed in the rooms at one time.


Class 10,000's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) equivalent is ISO 7. The primary function of clean rooms is to continuously filter air so that tiny particles in the air do not damage highly sensitive technologies, and in Class 10,000, the air changes 40-60 times an hour. However, this class is not particularly strict when it comes to limitations and rules regarding cleaning, moving around and clothing, but there are still special procedures for each of these activities that must be followed in order to prevent contamination. Applications and industries that utilize Class 10,000 clean rooms include electronics, for use in the assembly and fabrication of small, sensitive electrical components; scientific research, for use in laboratories for clean, controlled environments required for experimentation; and pharmaceutical, for the processing of chemicals for drugs that have strict regulations from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In Class 10,000 clean rooms, full-length protective attire such as bunny suits are not required to be worn. However, partial protective attire such as shoe covers, lab coats, hair nets, safety glasses and gloves should be adorned by everyone entering the room. This is to block any harmful contaminants from personnel such as skin flakes, cosmetics, hair follicles, sweat and more. The fabrication of clean rooms is performed in accordance with the various regulations, and the panel or wall material in Class 10,000 clean rooms is often made of materials such as white acrylic, steel or stainless steel, aluminum or polycarbonate. The design of these clean rooms is also monitored, but there is still a variety available. In fact, this class of clean rooms can be any of the three types: ballrooms, which are large and open rooms that are parts of the actual building; modular, which is a temporary and small room within a room; and soft wall, where the walls are made of tightly stretched or free-hanging fabric or plastic flaps. Additionally, Class 10,000 clean rooms may range in size from huge open spaces to tiny chambers, and may also offer extra features such as temperature control and electrostatic discharge control.

Industry Information


Softwall Cleanrooms
Clean rooms were initially used in the aerospace industry to aid the manufacturing process of sensitive hardware, but an increase in demand has led clean room manufacturers to fabricate these chambers for a multitude of industries such as microelectronics, research and development, defense, biotechnology, manufacturing, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. In accommodating this variety of industries, numerous types of clean rooms were developed as well. One variety is known as soft wall clean rooms. 
Soft wall clean rooms are enclosures that are atmospheric and climate-controlled, and are used in industries that involve carrying out sensitive testing, fabrication, and research processes, such as biotechnology research, medical testing, and semiconductor fabrication. Soft wall clean rooms differ from hard wall clean room systems in several ways. The walls of soft wall clean rooms can be made from fabric pulled taut by a frame, or translucent plastic strips that hang from a ceiling or other overhead fixture. In addition, they are not stationary once installed. They are much more portable than hard wall clean rooms, which are usually permanently in one place once installed. Some varieties of soft wall clean rooms come in a modular design for easier and quicker disassembly and reassembly. 
Soft wall clean rooms are lined with curtain dividers, which are typically made from vinyl, as clean rooms can only be constructed using materials that non-fibrous, non-corrosive, and avoid generating static electricity. Curtain dividers are especially useful if more than one process must be carried out within the same environment. Soft wall cleanrooms can also feature a tubular steel frame that supports the curtain walls, mounted filter units that draw outside air and deliver the clean air into the cleanroom. Soft wall clean rooms can be used for processes that do not require drastic amounts of decontamination. Soft wall clean rooms have several advantages, which include simple installation, easy configuration, entryway options, and portability in some varieties. Because of these advantages, soft wall clean rooms are a more economical option than their hard wall counterparts, especially if a strictly controlled and decontaminated environment is not necessary for the processes at hand. Soft wall clean rooms are capable of achieving a high level of decontamination in its own right when working in conjunction with other equipment such as double doors, air filters, and protective clothing (sometimes referred to as bunny suits). 
Governmental bodies such as the U. S. Federal Government and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have implemented rating systems that classify clean rooms. The rating systems differ from each other, but both are carefully observed by clean room manufacturers. One of these rating systems, the US FED STD 209E, is based around the volume of 0.5 micrometer-sized particles per cubic foot in the clean room's atmosphere. The higher the number of particles, the higher the rating. If a clean room must maintain an extremely low level of contaminants in its atmosphere, a set of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters must be installed, which work in conjunction with sterilizing chemicals, personnel decontamination systems, and other measures. It is more difficult for a soft walled clean room to achieve this high of a decontamination level than a hard walled enclosure. Meeting Class 1 standards is much easier to achieve with a permanent, hard walled clean room that features double doors and decontaminating air jets. However, for some sensitive applications, a Class 1 level of decontamination is not necessary. There are many applications, including high-tech operations, for which Class 100, 1,000, and even 10,000 clean rooms will suffice. For example, a class 100 clean room can be used for processes that could cause chemical reactions, as it is made of materials that will not release fibrous contaminants into the air. Another example is that Class 10,000 clean rooms, which are not as strictly controlled and are appropriate for less-sensitive applications, such as processes that will not wear away flexible acrylics or plastics. 
The ISO system of standards rates clean rooms on a scale of 3 to 8, with 3 being the most effective. To compare the ISO rating system with its federal counterpart, an ISO Class 5 clean room is the same as a clean room that is rated Class 100 US FED, due to both clean rooms permitting up to 100,000 contaminating particles per cubic meter. There are some industries that use the EMP EU system, which is the standard system of the European Union, and the BS 5295 system, which is used in Britain and uses cubic meters to measure airborne contaminants.

Industry Information


Growing Trends: Portable Clean Rooms
Portable clean rooms are movable atmospheric and climate-controlled 
enclosures used to conduct research, fabrication and other sensitive 
operations. They are also often modular, and some models can be 
assembled and disassembled without the assistance of service companies. 
Portable clean rooms are useful for operations that require a basic 
measure of control over the environments in which their operations are 
conducted.Flexibility is a major factor associated with portable clean
rooms. Biopharmaceutical processing is a booming industry that has dramatically
grown in the past few years. This increased demand for pharmaceuticals has
created a need for more clean rooms. Portable clean rooms are an ideal choice
to meet this growing demand because they are convenient to install and are
easily upgraded. These clean rooms are essential for creating conditions that
are suitable for applications that require high levels of cleanliness. 
Manufacturers have been designing new portable clean rooms
with very unique structures. These clean rooms are pre-assembled by the
manufacturer and then transported by flatbed trucks to the work site. The rooms
mimic similar durability features and processing capabilities of traditional
clean room facilities. The simplified design also cuts costs due to less
on-site construction. This allows for businesses to utilize the clean room
technology much quicker. These new clean rooms are also designed for
versatility with newer innovations regarding computers systems. Portable clean
rooms can be expanded for with additional self-contained clean rooms if
applications require more space. 
Clean rooms are known for being utilized in including:
automotive, semi-conductor manufacturing, military, aircraft, aerospace, pharmaceutical.
However clean rooms are becoming popular in the agriculture industry.
Researchers utilize clean rooms when experimenting on plant growth research as
well as analyzing plant production. There are a plethora of benefits regarding
the extreme level of environmental control that is associated with clean rooms.
These innovations are great for any application, facility or consumer that
requires particle control. 

Portable Clean Rooms Because they are portable, and because their materials are not intended to provide the same protection as those used in permanent clean rooms, portable clean rooms cannot offer particularly high levels of air-filtration and general decontamination. When combined with the use of personnel clean suits and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, they can provide levels of decontamination that are acceptable for some high-tech research and fabrication operations. Some models can be designed for the conducting of individual experiments; such models offer controlled enclosure volumes of no more than a few cubic feet. These can be ideal for use in bio-tech and medical testing applications. Other designs can be used to cover individual machines; this can often be the case in precision measuring operations. Operations that need access to clean rooms on a small scale will often find portable clean rooms to be an effective, economical choice. The contaminant level standards for all clean room varieties are set by governmental regulatory authorities and international standards organizations. The United States government's US FED STD 209E standards are based on the number of 0.5 micrometer-sized particles present per cubic foot within a clean room. Clean rooms given a Class 1 rating are subject to the strictest standard; Class 1 clean rooms should contain no more than one 0.5 micrometer-sized particle per cubic foot of atmosphere. Each subsequent class number corresponds to its particulate quantity. For example, Class 100 clean rooms should feature no more than 100 0.5 micrometer-sized particles per cubic foot of atmosphere. Normal, unfiltered air, if it were to be subject to US FED STD 209E, would be given a Class 1,000,000 rating. Portable clean rooms are generally not capable of filtering air to Class 1 levels; they are more commonly assigned class numbers of 1,000 and higher. The main advantage of portable clean room systems is that they provide smaller operations with an alternative to large, expensive, permanent clean rooms.

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

Purchasing[edit]
Aramark negotiates pricing and makes purchases directly from national manufacturers through distributors such as Sysco Corporation. The products range from healthcare, dairy, meats, seafood, frozen, canned and dry, paper & disposables, chemicals & janitorial, supplies & equipment, produce, and beverage.[4] Aramark has had distribution agreements with Sysco for more than 20 years. All prices for products to Aramark are calculated on Sysco’s costs, which is defined as the Vendor’s Last Invoice Price.[citation needed]
History[edit]
Aramark was founded as Davidson Brothers in 1936 by Davre and Henry Davidson.[5] Davidson Brothers began by providing vending services to plant employees in the aviation industry in Southern California.
In 1959, Davre Davidson partnered with William Fishman to establish ARA (Automatic Retailers of America), which became publicly traded a year later in 1960. In 1968, ARA provided services at the Mexico City Olympic Games, the first of 16 Games they have serviced, including Athens in 2004 and Beijing in 2008.[6]
In 1969, ARA officially became ARA Services, to reflect its growing range of businesses. In 1983, Joseph Neubauer was elected CEO of ARA Services and a year later, in 1984, Neubauer led a group of executives to fend off a hostile takeover bid by coordinating a management buyout.[7]
ARA Services changed its name to Aramark in 1994.[8] In 2001, Aramark returned to the New York Stock Exchange as a public company under the RMK ticker.[9] In 2006, a group of investors led by Neubauer (and including CCMP Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Thomas H. Lee Partners, and Warburg Pincus) proposed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of the Aramark Corporation, which was approved by shareholders. The merger was completed in 2007.[10][11]
In 2004, Aramark acquired a 90% stake in the Irish catering company Campbell Catering. In 2006, Aramark acquired Seamless. Aramark spun off its majority shares in Seamless in 2012.[12]
In July 2009, Aramark and the Colorado Rockies opened what is believed to be the first gluten-free concession stand in major league baseball.[13] By 2010, Aramark made gluten-free foods available at all 12 of its major league baseball accounts.[14]
On August 29, 2011 Green Mountain Coffee Roasters sold Van Houtte USA (Filterfresh) to Aramark for $145 million.[15][16]
In May 2012, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors had elected Eric J. Foss as CEO and that Joseph Neubauer would remain the company's Chairman.[17] In December 2014, Joseph Neubauer announced his retirement and Foss was elected as the company's next chairman.[18]
Ethical history[edit]
In recent years, Aramark has made several moves to boost its corporate social responsibility image. In 2015, Aramark aligned with the American Heart Association to reduce the amount of calories saturated fat and sodium by 20 percent and increase by 20 percent the amount of fruits and vegetables and whole grains in the 2 billion meals it serves annually by 2020.[19]
In 2015, the company also worked with the Humane Society of the United States on a comprehensive new animal welfare policy that includes purchasing only cage-free eggs by 2020 and eliminating all pork from animals bred using gestation crates by 2017. The company also eliminated the purchase of Foie gras in 2011.[20][21]
In addition to the animal welfare supply chain commitments in 2015, Aramark also announced a complete transition to sustainably sourced canned skipjack and albacore tuna in the U.S. by April 1, 2016.[22]
In 2008, Aramark Building Community, a company-wide volunteer initiative, was created to help neighborhoods rebuild community centers as well as provide support for job readiness programs, nutrition and wellness education, and basic human needs for families and neighborhoods. Since 2008 the company has invested more than $9 million in expertise, financial and in-kind resources to strengthen communities. More than 30,000 employees have dedicated their skills through hundreds of volunteer projects, impacting millions of people in dozens of cities through its annual Aramark Building Community Day activities.[23]
A spring 2009 survey of over 92,000 students supported the company's concept of trayless dining, which was developed to reduce the amount of campus waste.[24]
In response to First Lady Michelle Obama's childhood obesity Let's Move campaign in February 2010, Aramark, along with other major food service providers, pledged to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and salt in their meals over the next five years.[25] In an effort to help fight childhood obesity, in 2014, Aramark partnered with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on a program geared to nutrition education in disadvantaged neighborhoods.[26]
Aramark has received recognition for its ethical performance, diversity and inclusion efforts, veteran hiring practices and its employee recognition and healthy lifestyle commitments.[27][28][29]
Labor law violations[edit]
In April 2010, Aramark and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers reached a resolution that called for a 70−80% increase in wages for tomato pickers.[30]
Aramark has also been the subject of a number of scandals regarding labor practices and business ethics. These include firing workers for reporting unsanitary food conditions, paying fringe wages, not paying for all hours worked, not paying backpay, and firing or eliminating the positions of those who file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) claims.[31][32][33][34][35]
Food safety issues[edit]
In 2013, an investigation by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist Chris Hedges discovered that the food provided to inmates at Burlington County Jail in New Jersey was substandard and spoiled, and often made prisoners sick with diarrhea and vomiting.[36] Maggots found in the food preparation areas at Parnall Correctional Facility in Jackson, Michigan may have been the source of an outbreak of food-borne illness.[37][38] Maggots were also found in Aramark food products at Michigan's Charles Egeler Reception & Guidance Center[39] and two Ohio prisons, the Ohio Reformatory for Women and Trumbull Correctional Institute.[40] Aramark, however, was cleared by the Michigan Department of Corrections of any responsibility for inmate illness and for pests in Michigan.[41] Ohio and Michigan fined Aramark $270,000 and $200,000 respectively.[42]
In April 2015, the managing board of The Cavalier Daily, a student-run newspaper at the University of Virginia, reported that Aramark literally "served garbage" to inmates in the Saginaw Correctional Facility in Freeland, Michigan. It also noted that Aramark has in the past "underfed inmates and fed them dog food, worms and scraps of food from old meals" and argued that the University should reconsider its relationship with the food services contractor in light of these ethical issues.[43] Michigan's oversight of Aramark's performance was criticized as inadequate in a report released in August 2015 by the group Progress Michigan after Michigan moved to end the contract.[44]
Likewise, Aramark has been criticized for skimping portion sizes, food safety issues, and overcharging state governments (Michigan, Kentucky, and Florida) that have used their food in prisons; a Kentucky prison riot is reputed to have been caused by the low quality of food Aramark provided to inmates.[45][46]
Notable clients[edit]
Chicago Public Schools[edit]
Aramark has been criticized for the "filthy conditions" in Chicago Public Schools following the privatization of janitorial services and Aramark receiving a $260 million contract for their management. Responding to these reports, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said "Aramark's job is to clean the schools, so our principals and teachers can focus on their fundamental responsibility: education. They will either live up to that contract and clean up the schools or they can clean out their desks and get out."[47]
Wichita Falls Independent School District[edit]
Aramark was hired for $2.65 million per year to provide janitorial services on 28 schools and three administration buildings by the Wichita Falls Independent School District in 2015. The district cancelled Aramark's contract and hired another firm due to numerous complaints about bad service. A report issued by the Wichita Falls-Wichita County Public Health District determined that one high school was infested with rats and mice. Janet Powell, the district's director of support services said, "Everyone on the committee felt lied to and deceived (by Aramark)."[48]
Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction[edit]
Main article: Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
Since 2013, numerous Aramark employees providing food services in Ohio prisons have been fired or otherwise disciplined for inappropriate behavior towards prisoners such as sexual relations, letter writing, and smuggling contraband. At least 204 Aramark employees have been banned from entering Ohio prisons for such violations. On December 1, 2015 inmates working in the kitchen under Aramark management held a strike because they were required to cut meat with pan lids instead of being allowed to use meat slicers. An Aramark employee was given a written reprimand over the incident.[49]
Since the state start using Aramark in 2013, the Ohio Civil Services Employee Association has been trying to regain control of the food services contract. A bid submitted by the union in spring of 2015 failed after a state review found it did not properly reflect projected costs. Aramark's contract was renewed. The head of the union said Aramark “continues to violate their contract every day with food shortages, health and safety violations, bad employee conduct, low food quality.” As of late 2015, the union was pursuing arbitration against the state over this contract.[49]
In 2014, Aramark was issued two fines totaling $272,200 for contract violations. The state offered to credit money spent on additional employee training towards the fines. The same year nine Aramark employees were fired for contraband violations and 15 were fired for "security violations."[49]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
