About





Professor Boyd, Nonequilibrium Gas and Plasma Dynamics Laboratory, teaches gas dynamics at the undergraduate and graduate levels and has introduced a new course on hypersonic aerothermodynamics at the graduate level. His research interests are in the numerical simulation of aerospace systems involving nonequilibrium gas and plasma dynamics. Examples of such systems include spacecraft electric propulsion, hypersonic vehicles, rocket plumes, and micro-scale gas flows. Research activities typically involve development of models to simulate physical processes, development of numerical algorithms, and application of the models and algorithms to real systems of interest. He is author or co-author of more than 200 refereed journal papers and numerous conference papers and presentations.
