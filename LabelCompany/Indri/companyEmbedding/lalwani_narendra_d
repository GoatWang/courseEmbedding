P2Y13 Receptor Regulates HDL Metabolism and Atherosclerosis In Vivo


Marine Goffinet, Claudine Tardy, Nadia Boubekeur, Guy Cholez, Alice Bluteau, Daniela C. Oniciu, Narendra D. Lalwani, Jean-Louis H. Dasseux, Ronald Barbaras, Rudi Baron


PLOS ONE 
,
																				2014,
																				
																				DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0095807


Abstract:
																						High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known to protect against atherosclerosis by promoting the reverse cholesterol transport. A new pathway for the regulation of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) removal involving F1-ATPase and P2Y13 receptor (P2Y13R) was described in vitro, and recently in mice. However, the physiological role of F1-ATPase/P2Y13R pathway in the modulation of vascular pathology i.e. in the development of atherosclerotic plaques is still unknown. We designed a specific novel agonist (CT1007900) of the P2Y13R that caused stimulation of bile acid secretion associated with an increased uptake of HDL-c in the liver after single dosing in mice. Repeated dose administration in mice, for 2 weeks, stimulated the apoA-I synthesis and formation of small HDL particles. Plasma samples from the agonist-treated mice had high efflux capacity for mobilization of cholesterol in vitro compared to placebo group. In apoE？/？ mice this agonist induced a decrease of atherosclerotic plaques in aortas and carotids. The specificity of P2Y13R pathway in those mice was assessed using adenovirus encoding P2Y13R-shRNA. These results demonstrate that P2Y13R plays a pivotal role in the HDL metabolism and could also be a useful therapeutic agent to decrease atherosclerosis. In this study, the up-regulation of HDL-c metabolism via activation of the P2Y13R using agonists could promote reverse cholesterol transport and promote inhibition of atherosclerosis progression in mice.

																				2007,
																				
																				
																				
																				

Abstract:
																						The ability to deliver therapeutic agents to a patient in a pulsatile or staggered release profile has been a major goal in drug delivery research recently. This review will cover methods that have been developed to control drug delivery profile with different polymeric systems. Externally and internally controlled systems will be considered, including a range of technologies like preprogrammed systems as well as systems that are sensitive to modulated enzymatic or hydrolytic degradation, pH, magnetic fields, ultrasounds, electric fields, temperature, light and mechanical stimulation. These systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for patients undergoing therapy with a variable dosing regime.

Experimental Proof of Mass in Photon
 [PDF]


Narendra Swarup Agarwal


Journal of Modern Physics (JMP)
,
																				2015,
																				
																				DOI: 10.4236/jmp.2015.65068


Abstract:
																						The
present work deals with the mass of photon which creates a force at the contact
point of reflection resulting in slight deviation of photon from its path after
reflection. Only the mass of photon can cause deviation due to inertial force.
If photon has no mass, it cannot deviate. It is also found that this deviation
of photon depends on the angle of polarization plane of laser light with
respect to reflecting mirror. Such variation in the angle of deviation by the
plane of polarization proves that the mass of photon is neither in the centre
of photon nor distributed uniformly but located off-centre (away from the
centre of photon). This work proves that
photon has mass and the most important part of this work is to discover that
the mass of the photon is located off-centre (away from the centre of photon). This discovery explains Wave Particle Duality of electromagnetic
radiations.

Adaptive Lifting Transform for Classification of Hyperspectral Signatures
 [PDF]


Rajesh Agrawal, Narendra Bawane


Advances in Remote Sensing (ARS)
,
																				2015,
																				
																				DOI: 10.4236/ars.2015.42012


Abstract:
																						Supervised classification of hyperspectral images is a challenging task because of the higher dimensionality of a pixel signature. The conventional classifiers require large training data set; however, practically limited numbers of labeled pixels are available due to complexity and cost involved in sample collection. It is essential to have a method that can reduce such higher dimensional data into lower dimensional feature space without the loss of useful information. For classification purpose, it will be useful if such a method takes into account the nature of the underlying signal when extracting lower dimensional feature vector. The lifting framework provides the required flexibility. This article proposes the adaptive lifting wavelet transform to extract the lower dimensional feature vectors for the classification of hyperspectral signatures. The proposed adaptive update step allows the decomposition filter to adapt to the input signal so as to retain the desired characteristics of the signal. A three-layer feed forward neural network is used as a supervised classifier to classify the extracted features. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on two hyperspectral data sets (HYDICE & ROSIS sensors). The performance of the proposed method is compared with first generation discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based feature extraction method and previous studies that use the same data. The indices used for measuring performance are overall classification accuracy and Kappa value. The experimental results show that the proposed adaptive lifting scheme (ALS) has excellent results with a small size training set.
