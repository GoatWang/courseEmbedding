property has a Carrying Value on the books of the Partnership
different from its adjusted tax basis to the Partnership for U.S.
Federal income tax purposes (whether by reason of the contribution
of such property to the Partnership or otherwise), allocations of
taxable income, gain, loss and deduction under this Article 3

between the adjusted tax basis of such asset for federal income tax
purposes and its Carrying Value in the same manner as under Code
section 704(c) or the principles set forth in Treasury
Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g), as the case may be, using
the remedial method set forth in Treasury Regulation section

PRESS RELEASE
Albuquerque, New Mexico (PRWEB) August 13, 2013
Masterson Industries, LLC, a new breed of materials company, today announced that it has closed an investment from Cottonwood Technology Fund and Pangaea Ventures Fund III LP. This investment will be focused on commercializing Masterson’s Microgravity Enabled Materials technology and quickly bringing its products to market.
“We’re very excited about having such a talented and experienced investment group on our team to help us efficiently transition our technology to waiting markets,” said Masterson Industries President Rich Glover. “With this funding, we’ve moved beyond the research and development phase and are now focused on ensuring routine, reliable, and consistent production of our materials. Our customers can expect the same level of consistent quality that they would demand from any other traditional materials company.” Cottonwood’s broad technological vision combined with Pangaea’s deep knowledge of the advanced materials industry provides exactly the type of partnership support Masterson needs to meet those expectations.
“Masterson represents the best of what New Mexico has to offer – smart experienced engineers with innovative ideas that can change markets. Being joined in this investment by Pangaea is a great endorsement given their depth of advanced materials expertise.” said David Blivin, Managing Partner of Cottonwood Technology Funds.
According to Chris Erickson, General Partner, Pangaea Ventures, “We’ve never seen anything like this and we are genuinely excited about the opportunity to work with Cottonwood to turn Masterson’s truly disruptive technology into a major force across multiple markets.”
About Masterson Industries
Masterson Industries, LLC was formed in 2012 and is focused on the commercial production of Microgravity Enabled Materials (MEMs) with specific application to existing industrial demand. MEMs are materials with properties unique to manufacture/production in microgravity and generally either cannot be produced in a standard 1g environment or are of very poor quality when produced in a 1g environment.
About Cottonwood Technology Fund
Cottonwood Technology Fund is a seed and early-stage technology commercialization fund with offices in Santa Fe and Albuquerque, New Mexico. It investments in technology-related (particularly chemistry/material sciences, photonics, biosciences and new energy related) businesses originating throughout the Southwest region generally bordered by Phoenix, Denver and Austin and including the Paso Del Norte region, running from Los Alamos, New Mexico to El Paso, Texas. This region includes three national laboratories, over a dozen major research universities and several major research medical centers. Other current investments include Skorpios, FibeRio, xF Technologies (formerly Incitor), Respira, Trilumina and Exagen.
About Pangaea Ventures
Pangaea is the world leader in advanced materials venture capital. We invest in start-up companies with disruptive breakthrough innovation in chemistry and material science. Pangaea believes that breakthroughs in advanced materials are becoming increasingly important for companies to excel in almost any market. Advanced materials are solving fundamental problems necessary to make products more efficient and less expensive, two of the key attributes necessary for widespread adoption of any product. Pangaea has a strong preference for capital efficient businesses. Our investment thesis is technology- and IP-driven.
