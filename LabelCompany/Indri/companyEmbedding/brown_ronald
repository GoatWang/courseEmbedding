JAMES BROWN GUITAR PICK

James Brown Ronald Laster Guitar Pick.

Guitar picks, backstage passes and local crew t-shirts from a stagehand working concerts and live theater productions in the Pacific Northwest for the past 20 years. From club shows to arenas, I have collected this stuff and put aside until now. Passes issued for shows worked and guitar picks are from the stage and/or directly from the guitar tech. Some picks may show wear and tear from use on stage.
