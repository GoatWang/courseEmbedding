The Man,The Shield,The Legend


The story of our whisky begins with the courage of warriors and the man who led them, Sir James Douglas.
The Black Douglas is a tribute to the legendary Sir James Douglas, Scotland’s mightiest warrior and invincible scourge of Northern England. He died in a fierce battle against overwhelming Spanish forces swinging his claymore and clutching a silver casket containing the heart of Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland. 
True to his word, he was courageous to the end. And now, some 700 years since his passing, we immortalise his spirit with our whisky that proudly bears his name.
Sir James Douglas and his bold, courageous men are celebrated to this day with every glass of The Black Douglas Scotch Whisky.
 





  
 

Scotch Whisky RegionsSpeyside Whiskies from this region can range from light and grassy, all the way up to rich and sweet. They're easy to enjoy, yet also complex, making them perfect for both Whisky newcomers, as well as seasoned experts. It's that vital Whisky ingredient that we know as water from the River Spey. Scotch Whisky Regions 

 

Scotch Whisky RegionsThe Highlands The Highlands is Scotland's largest Whisky region. With this ample space, the distilleries have room to spread out, meaning that the Highland's Whiskies often have highly individual flavours and ingredients. In the North, many distilleries are situated by the seaside. This means big, peaty flavours, but still a nice twist of complexity. Down south and to the east, you're more likely to find medium to full-bodied Scotch that's smooth and sweet, while out west is home to light-bodied expressions, as well as peaty, powerful Single Malts. Scotch Whisky Regions 

 

Scotch Whisky RegionsThe Lowlands The Lowlands offer a more gentle version of Scotch, ideal for Whisky newcomers. However, the biggest factor comes not from ingredients and location, but from method. Many Lowland Whiskies are triple distilled (most other Scotch is double distilled), the extra attention giving them a more inviting taste. While this practice is hardly unheard of in other regions, it's a trademark of the Lowlands. Scotch Whisky Regions 

 

Scotch Whisky RegionsIslay Islay's (pronounced I-la) Whiskies are bold, brash and pack a punch you won't find anywhere else. Islay Whiskies owe their distinctive flavour to a combination of location, ingredients and local expertise. It all begins in Islay's swamps, bogs and wetlands. That's where you'll find peat, a type of partially decayed vegetation that helps give Islay Whiskies their distinct taste. The result is Whisky that's intensely smoky, powerful and not for the faint of heart. Scotch Whisky Regions 

 

Scotch Whisky RegionsThe Islands Due to their location on the windswept, rugged and sometimes barren landscapes, these whiskies usually have a coastal feel, often salty, with seaweed characteristics and a soft, sweeter peat aroma. Whisky from the Islands has an unmistakably powerful flavour. Scotch Whisky Regions 

 

Scotch Whisky RegionsCampbeltown Campbeltown malts tend to be robust, complex whiskies that are full of flavour with hints of sea salt and mild peat. It is the proximity to the coast that gives the whisky its salty tang. Campbeltown single malts make excellent aperitifs.

            BCFx  -  The Doug Williams Edition is a first-of-its-kind game that immerses players in the rich culture, history and
pageantry of football game day on Historically Black College and University (HBCU) campuses. The game fuses
realistic, bone-jarring football action created using the Unreal 3.0 engine with two unique new rhythm games  - 
the interactive Halftime Show and Drum Line Challenge. In addition, a wealth of historical data has been
integrated in the Legacy Museum and dozens of licensed tracks performed by college football's most entertaining
marching bands are included in the game's Jukebox.
        


Authentic Gameday Experience - Realistic gridiron action puts you in the heart of the game while authentic stadiums, fight songs, marching bands and dynamic crowds immerse you in a true game day experience. 
Halftime is still Game Time  -  Super human band drills and drum major performances will keep you in your seat for the halftime show. Compete in an interactive band challenge for second half momentum or sit back and enjoy the show. 
Drumline Challenge  -  Battle it out in a head-to-head, rhythm-based mini game. Features more than 100 authentic drum cadences and songs from which to choose. 
Legacy Museum  -  Experience a tribute to the great institutions represented in the game and learn more about legendary players such as Doug Williams, Jerry Rice and immortal coach Eddie Robinson.

5.0 out of 5 starsRiotous, Rollicking, Fabulous, Spiritual TENNAPEL-NESS!ByMiron August 2, 2007He has done it again. Doug TenNapel has taken an assortment of elements/genres--gangster, romance, sci-fi, horror, action, comedy, spiritual warfare--and made it all work together. The description on the cover says, "A lurid tale of sex, violence, and the supernatural." Yup. And funny as heck. They forgot that part. And moving. Forgot that, too. And full of mercy for the outcast, the prodigal, the misfit, and the...alien. Not to mention squirrels.I can't offer much by way of summary without giving away some fun plot points and twists. I know you'd much rather learn those on your own the old-fashioned way (by reading it), so here it is: Bad guy Eddie Paretti, who's fallen in love with a stripper named Black Cherry, finds that 1. his girl is gone from the strip place and 2. he's made a deal to steal a body from his own mob boss in order to get money to pay off his debts and 3. that body is not what he expects.Stealing that body is about to get Eddie in a big, big fix, and it's going to save him, too, in all sorts of ways.The cast includes some staples of sci-fi/crime fiction/spiritual warfare/horror: demons, angels, bad guys, good guys, a priest, an alien, the hot chick, the wise-cracking protagonist, the cool pal, and car chases.But TenNapel has a way of taking traditional elements and doing something wacky, funny, moving, and new with them, and always with some spiritual insights. What he does with one particular, er, sacrament is to die for.I love D.G. and I couldn't put down BLACK CHERRY.This gets a big thumbs up for graphicky novel goodness. Or is that badness?And yeah, if you're easily offended by cussing and sexual talk, then this is not the work for you. But, as TenNapel says in his preface, "Criminals don't talk like they are trying to keep from offending soccer moms."One quibble: The ending needed a little more space. At least another couple of pages to fill out some blanks. But, really, that's all I found wanting.Hurry up with the next one, Doug. Your graphic novels are each a delicious, demented delight.Mir

1.0 out of 5 starsOffensive...but not for the reasons you think....ByMatthew Mcgeeon August 25, 2007I am a big fan of Doug Tennapel's work. I own damn near everything he has done to date. As an employee of a world famous comic shop in new york city I pushed his work on anyone and everyone who would listen. I must have hand sold each copy of Tommysaurus Rex we got in. So with this out in the open, let me get to my dissapointment with his latest graphic novel, Black Cherry.I was unaware of Mr. Tennapel's Christian leanings untill...well probably Earthboy Jacobus. EJ is easily his most overtly christian work. Wholesome stories of Mr. Tennapel's style do not need to be labled "christian," they were just good. (i have the same point of view with christian music...which i listen to alot of- Zao, underoath, the chariot, etc). I have no inherent bias against christians in any way, shape, or form. That said, Black Cherry is both Mr. Tennapel's most mature work and his most religious. There is a introduction by the author explaining to his christian readership that his characters in this book do bad things (and they do, alot.) because thats what real people do, and he wants his characters to ring true.Eddie is a typical, down on his luck, low level mafioso. The stripper love of his life up and dissapeared and he owes his boss money and he lives a life that is an ongoing crisis of faith. Then there is an alien, and demons, and a priest. Story-wise it's a roller coaster...and like a lot of Mr. Tennapel's work, spends 2/3 on set up and the last 1/3 rushes like a frieght train. I am not saying this is bad at all...the slow build into the frantically paced conclusion works really well. The art is fantastic! Mr. Tennapel's brush style is always kinetic and gorgeous to take in. The character of mary is especially well illustrated...in a book of violence and craziness, she has the fully rendered eyes of a standard disney princess in all frames amid wild brushstrokes.The first point where i realized this book had a huge problem occurs about half way through (sorry the pages are not numbered...which is a super pet peeve of mine anyway) Eddie utters the following line, "You are dead, for you are GAY." Now, prior to this point in the book there were a couple of other references to homosexuality, mostly in a humorous way. The best of which being, in reference to eddie's zippo, "the homosexualist thing since homosexuality came to homosexualtown." But now, this whole proclamation of "you are dead, for you are gay" sort of reeks of a statement. And knowing Mr. Tennapel's religious leanings...well...what can i say? i feel that he's using his work to push the common christian misconception that homosexuality is a sin and evil, and he's elevating it to a point where he believes that homosexuals should be killed for no reason other than their "preference." To further his point...whenever the horde of demons shows up and surrounds eddie...one of them always suggests that they "put a dick in his butt." Because you know...all gays are demons and they and their sex acts could only come from hell.I had waited for this book for a long time...I was sooo looking forward to Doug Tennapel finally doing a "mature readers" book. I could not wait to see his style, which i have loved for so long, finally applied to a gritty story for adults. I was very sad to find out that it is just a religious tract with some pretty art. I am not ready ro write off Mr. Tennapel just yet...he has another book or two set to come out in the next year or so...but no longer is his work something i will buy sight unseen. Now i will carefully check it out and see if his bigotry is so ham-fisted as to offend me. Trust me...to offend me is quite the feat.-matt

    See all 17 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsRiotous, Rollicking, Fabulous, Spiritual TENNAPEL-NESS!ByMirTOP 500 REVIEWERon August 2, 2007Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseHe has done it again. Doug TenNapel has taken an assortment of elements/genres--gangster, romance, sci-fi, horror, action, comedy, spiritual warfare--and made it all work together. The description on the cover says, "A lurid tale of sex, violence, and the supernatural." Yup. And funny as heck. They forgot that part. And moving. Forgot that, too. And full of mercy for the outcast, the prodigal, the misfit, and the...alien. Not to mention squirrels.I can't offer much by way of summary without giving away some fun plot points and twists. I know you'd much rather learn those on your own the old-fashioned way (by reading it), so here it is: Bad guy Eddie Paretti, who's fallen in love with a stripper named Black Cherry, finds that 1. his girl is gone from the strip place and 2. he's made a deal to steal a body from his own mob boss in order to get money to pay off his debts and 3. that body is not what he expects.Stealing that body is about to get Eddie in a big, big fix, and it's going to save him, too, in all sorts of ways.The cast includes some staples of sci-fi/crime fiction/spiritual warfare/horror: demons, angels, bad guys, good guys, a priest, an alien, the hot chick, the wise-cracking protagonist, the cool pal, and car chases.But TenNapel has a way of taking traditional elements and doing something wacky, funny, moving, and new with them, and always with some spiritual insights. What he does with one particular, er, sacrament is to die for.I love D.G. and I couldn't put down BLACK CHERRY.This gets a big thumbs up for graphicky novel goodness. Or is that badness?And yeah, if you're easily offended by cussing and sexual talk, then this is not the work for you. But, as TenNapel says in his preface, "Criminals don't talk like they are trying to keep from offending soccer moms."One quibble: The ending needed a little more space. At least another couple of pages to fill out some blanks. But, really, that's all I found wanting.Hurry up with the next one, Doug. Your graphic novels are each a delicious, demented delight.Mir0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsRequired reading for visual storytellers.ByJoshua Grahamon December 7, 2010Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI honestly think that the genius of this work starts even before the story does, in the forward where Doug's simple, matter-of-fact rebuttal to content-critics provides a roadmap to other authors and artists who struggle with the same issues raised by the content of Black Cherry. There's a difference between obscenity and reality, and there's something strikingly, perhaps even dangerously untrue about media that tries to show us a sanitized version of the underbelly of society. Eddie's world is not one most of us would be comfortable in, but for all its demon-possessed mobsters and the monster cars that eat them, it feels more real than worlds where criminals talk -- as Tennapel put it -- like they're afraid of offending soccer moms.All that aside, it's the story that really shines, and I wouldn't be doing you any favors by spoiling it. Check out Black Cherry with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsGreat funByKurt Belcheron November 2, 2008Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI had bought this book for a friend, but I couldn't let it go without reading it myself.  I had only heard TenNapel's name in relation to "Earthworm Jim", so I wasn't expecting too much.  Well, to be honest, I didn't know WHAT to expect.Well, color me surprised.  This book was not only well-crafted, but it was a hell of a lot of fun.  TenNapel's work seems to be a matter of jumping on an idea and just writing and drawing as it goes, and descends into every-deeper recesses of insanity.  The book starts with a fairly 'normal' premise: Mafia hatchet man doing a job for his family.  It goes from there into a story of alien Catholic priests being pursued by devils who want his powers for themselves, and whatever other craziness TenNapel can throw in.I found myself laughing at every turn.  From 'Get a dick in his butt!' to to the main character crashing a UFO into a building...it was all so over-the-top, there was no way you COULDN'T laugh at it.I'd highly recommend the book.  If you don't get at least a guffaw, a chuckle, or a belly laugh out of it, there's something seriously wrong with you.KAB0Comment|

Either way, its got thugs, romance, and aliens, and plenty of good messages hidden under all the "black."As one of Doug's more adult novels, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this one for younger audiences, but if you think you're old enough for "A lurid tale of sex, violence, and the supernatural," then this a good read.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.1.0 out of 5 starsOffensive...but not for the reasons you think....ByMatthew Mcgeeon August 25, 2007Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI am a big fan of Doug Tennapel's work. I own damn near everything he has done to date. As an employee of a world famous comic shop in new york city I pushed his work on anyone and everyone who would listen. I must have hand sold each copy of Tommysaurus Rex we got in. So with this out in the open, let me get to my dissapointment with his latest graphic novel, Black Cherry.I was unaware of Mr. Tennapel's Christian leanings untill...well probably Earthboy Jacobus. EJ is easily his most overtly christian work. Wholesome stories of Mr. Tennapel's style do not need to be labled "christian," they were just good. (i have the same point of view with christian music...which i listen to alot of- Zao, underoath, the chariot, etc). I have no inherent bias against christians in any way, shape, or form. That said, Black Cherry is both Mr. Tennapel's most mature work and his most religious. There is a introduction by the author explaining to his christian readership that his characters in this book do bad things (and they do, alot.) because thats what real people do, and he wants his characters to ring true.Eddie is a typical, down on his luck, low level mafioso. The stripper love of his life up and dissapeared and he owes his boss money and he lives a life that is an ongoing crisis of faith. Then there is an alien, and demons, and a priest. Story-wise it's a roller coaster...and like a lot of Mr. Tennapel's work, spends 2/3 on set up and the last 1/3 rushes like a frieght train. I am not saying this is bad at all...the slow build into the frantically paced conclusion works really well. The art is fantastic! Mr. Tennapel's brush style is always kinetic and gorgeous to take in. The character of mary is especially well illustrated...in a book of violence and craziness, she has the fully rendered eyes of a standard disney princess in all frames amid wild brushstrokes.The first point where i realized this book had a huge problem occurs about half way through (sorry the pages are not numbered...which is a super pet peeve of mine anyway) Eddie utters the following line, "You are dead, for you are GAY." Now, prior to this point in the book there were a couple of other references to homosexuality, mostly in a humorous way. The best of which being, in reference to eddie's zippo, "the homosexualist thing since homosexuality came to homosexualtown." But now, this whole proclamation of "you are dead, for you are gay" sort of reeks of a statement. And knowing Mr. Tennapel's religious leanings...well...what can i say? i feel that he's using his work to push the common christian misconception that homosexuality is a sin and evil, and he's elevating it to a point where he believes that homosexuals should be killed for no reason other than their "preference." To further his point...whenever the horde of demons shows up and surrounds eddie...one of them always suggests that they "put a dick in his butt." Because you know...all gays are demons and they and their sex acts could only come from hell.I had waited for this book for a long time...I was sooo looking forward to Doug Tennapel finally doing a "mature readers" book.
