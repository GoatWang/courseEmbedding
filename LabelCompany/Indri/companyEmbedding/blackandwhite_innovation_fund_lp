Brummer add Black-and-White Innovation Fund to BMS


			  			by Jonathan Furelid —			19/10/2016 					
		


 
Stockholm (HedgeNordic) – Brummer & Partners have announced the addition of  Black-and-White Innovation Fund to its Brummer Multi-Strategy (BMS) family of funds. Investments into the new fund will start on November 1, 2016, according to a press release on the Brummer website.

The Black-and-White Innovation Fund employs a long/short equity strategy that aims to take advantage of trends in technological innovation. The fund will invest in the traditional TMT-sector as well as in other sectors that are affected by innovation and technological development, where companies either are leading change or get obsolete due to lack of innovation. The mandate is global but the fund will focus on the US market.
Black-and-White Innovation will be managed by Seth Wunder who previously was one of the porfolio managers behind the Manticore hedge fund, a fund that was managed by Contour Asset Management under the Brummer umbrella.
Wunder brings 17 years of fund management experience and will manage the fund together with an investment team consisting of Matthew Berg, most recently with York Capital, and Omnig Terzian, previously with Zweig-Dimenna Associates.
The fund is based in Los Angeles, California.
The BMS Fund will allocate around 270 MUSD to Black-and-White as per November 1, 2016 which corresponds to 5 percent of total fund assets in BMS, the press release states.

    BMS invests in California based Black-and-White Innovation Fund



Brummer & Partners welcomes Black-and-White Capital LP (Black-and-White) to the group. Black-and-White manages the Black-and-White Innovation Fund, a new fund to be launched on November 1st 2016. CIO and portfolio manager is Seth Wunder, previously co-Portfolio Manager of Manticore. Black-and-White’s goal is to through a research-oriented long-short equity strategy, take advantage of the ever changing landscape of technological innovation.  



Black-and-White’s investment objective is to capture long and short alpha opportunities to produce competitive risk-adjusted returns. This is achieved by investing in both the traditional TMT industry, as well as other sectors subject to technological advancement, where specific companies are either driving the change or falling behind in terms of innovation and the ability to adapt. The mandate is global with a U.S. focus. 
Seth Wunder is the founder and Portfolio Manager of Black-and-White. Seth has 17 years of buy side-experience, most recently as Principal and Portfolio Manager of the Manticore Fund at Contour Asset Management LLC (“Contour”), also within the Brummer & Partners Group.  Before that he was a Senior Analyst and Partner at Tracer Capital Management. In addition to Seth Wunder, Black-and-White’s Investment team consists of Matthew Berg, most recently from York Capital and Onnig Terzian, previously at Zweig-Dimenna Associates. Black-and-White is based in Los Angeles, California.  
“We are happy to welcome Black-and-White to Brummer & Partners. We know CIO Seth Wunder well, as he has worked within the group with risk mandates since 2009. We have been able to see that he has historically displayed portfolio management skills that are expected to benefit BMS, now within Black-and-White. Their focus on taking advantage of investment opportunities that arise when new technologies and innovations reshape markets and challenge the incumbents is compelling, and offers opportunities in a broader investment mandate than in the traditional TMT sector” says Klaus Jäntti, Portfolio Manager at Brummer Multi-Strategy and CEO of Brummer & Partners.
The investment team will apply a highly-focused but flexible research structure, designed to allocate time and resources towards the best alpha generating opportunities throughout the broad universe of TMT, as well as other sectors affected by innovative tech trends.
Along with the Portfolio Manager, Brummer & Partners has acquired a stake in the investment management company Black-and-White, in line with Brummer & Partners’ business model.
Brummer Multi-Strategy (BMS) Master will make an initial allocation of approximately USD 270 million, corresponding to 5 percent of BMS’s NAV as of 1 November 2016.
