The Staff there is very professional and polite. The agency has booked all of my 5***** vacations for the last 13 years and counting. LaCresia strives on great customer service which includes attending any meet and greets you may schedule when booking Group traveling, Any personal Concierge services you may want while on vacation and shes always a phone call away. The Agency just booked a 24 diva trip I hosted to Jamacia and when I tell you my Agent (LaCresia) when above and beyond the call of duty by meeting us at the airport at 5am to ensure that each Diva that has never traveled before was aboard that plane. Hats off and 5 thumbs up to PERSONAL TOUCH TOURS. I will always recommend the Agency to all of my Family and Friends.Personal Touch Toursjimalone ratedStressed out about planning a vacation; then stress no more, worried about what to do and how to get it done; worry no more. Everything you think you may need to know, if your not sure what to ask, comparing pricing or just shopping around for options; Personal Touch Tours has always put a personal touch to all my travel needs. I have traveled with this agency since relocating to Atlanta, GA in 1994. I can honestly say that the professionalism, customer service skills, flexibility and availability of the staff  continue to bring me back.
