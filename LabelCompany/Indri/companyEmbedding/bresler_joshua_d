Joshua D. JonesPrincipalAlabamaDirect 205.820.8227Fax 205.719.0500jdjones@bressler.comOverviewExperienceNews & PublicationsSpeakingAwards & Honors“In business, the practice of law or day-to-day life, the primary foundations of any lasting success are integrity and hard work.” 
Josh Jones focuses his practice in the defense of brokerage firms and financial institutions against claims asserted by their customers and employees in state and federal court and in arbitration proceedings throughout the United States.  In addition, Josh has a general litigation practice, defends companies and individuals in connection with criminal and regulatory investigations, and represents lenders in reorganization, workout and litigated insolvency matters.
Josh’s first job was baling hay as a fifteen year old in August in the Alabama heat and humidity.  In addition to learning the value of working hard and pretty quickly realizing that he did not want to spend too many days in a hayfield, he saw that there were some people you could rely to give their best and to get the job done even when they were tired, things were tough, and the day grew long.  He tries to be that person for his clients, someone they can rely on to get the job done.  It is a pretty simple philosophy really, but one that has helped him gain the trust of clients from some of the largest financial companies in the world to small business owners here in Alabama. 
Josh is committed to the ideal of an attorney as a public servant, including through an active pro bono practice.  For several years, he represented multiple indigent children through the Immigrant Children’s Advocacy Project of Catholic Charities of Atlanta in an effort to assist these kids with securing Special Juvenile Immigrant Status.  More recently, Josh has focused his pro bono practice on veterans' issues, including volunteering with the ABA Military Pro Bono Project and Operation Stand-By, and securing accreditation with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs through the ABA’s Veterans’ Claims Assistance Network.  In addition, Josh currently serves the bar at large in his role as Co-chair of the ABA Section of Litigation’s Securities Litigation Committee.
In the community, Josh serves on the Board of Directors of Childcare Resources, a local non-profit child care resource and referral agency.  The mission of Childcare Resources is to make quality care and education of children happen by providing information, education and assistance to families, child care providers and the community.  He has volunteered at CCR since 2006, when he became a member of its Junior Board.  He is also an active member of Amici – Young Friends of Birmingham Opera since 2011.
While in law school, Josh was a student clerk for the Honorable G. Steven Agee of the Supreme Court of Virginia, now of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  Before beginning law school, he was the owner and operator of a small business in his hometown of Tuscaloosa, Alabama.Experience

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedDental DisordersTooth AbscessTooth DecayEducationResidency HospitalChildren's Hospital Of Philadelphia/University Of Pennsylvania School Of Dental MedicineCompleted in 2005Undergraduate SchoolPenn State UniversityGraduated in 1999Other EducationTemple University School Of DentistryCompleted in 2003Languages SpokenEnglishMemberships & Professional AffiliationsDr. Bresler does not have any memberships or affiliations listed.
