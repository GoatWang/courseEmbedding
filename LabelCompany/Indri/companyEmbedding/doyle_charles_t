Silane reductions in acidic media. VIII. Boron trifluoride catalyzed organosilane reductions. selectivity and mechanism

Abstract
Aldehydes and ketones are selectively reduced by organosilanes in boron trifluoride etherate through a process in which boron trifluoride is consumed and fluorosilanes are formed. Reductions of aldehydes and ketones by triethylsilane produce, after hydrolysis, alcohols and symmetrical ethers or, when aryl ketones are reduced, hydrocarbons. Two new synthetic transformations involving organosilanes, reductive elimination and acylation-reduction, are described. The mechanism of reduction in BF3 · Et2O is suggested to involve hydrosilylation of the boron trifluoride-activated carbonyl group followed by fluoride displacement at silicon. The stereoselectivity of the boron trifluoride catalyzed reduction in reactions with alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones is described and compared to similar transformations with other acid catalysts. The stereochemical data show that in hydride transfer reactions Lewis acid complexation with the carbonyl oxygen plays a major role in determining product selectivity.

The mechanism of reduction in BF3 · Et2O is suggested to involve hydrosilylation of the boron trifluoride-activated carbonyl group followed by fluoride displacement at silicon. The stereoselectivity of the boron trifluoride catalyzed reduction in reactions with alkyl-substituted cyclohexanones is described and compared to similar transformations with other acid catalysts. The stereochemical data show that in hydride transfer reactions Lewis acid complexation with the carbonyl oxygen plays a major role in determining product selectivity.UR  - http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?scp=0000226025&partnerID=8YFLogxKUR  - http://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.url?scp=0000226025&partnerID=8YFLogxKU2  - 10.1016/S0022-328X(00)87264-2DO  - 10.1016/S0022-328X(00)87264-2M3  - ArticleVL  - 117SP  - 129EP  - 140JO  - Journal of Organometallic ChemistryT2  - Journal of Organometallic ChemistryJF  - Journal of Organometallic ChemistrySN  - 0022-328XIS  - 2ER  -
