Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-3
    





August 19, 2015 05:42 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the notes issued by 
      Capital Auto Receivables Asset Trust 2015-3:
    

      --$197,000,000 class A-1a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$131,000,000 
      class A-1b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$227,000,000 class A-2 
      notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$227,000,000 class A-3 notes 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$86,640,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$50,940,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$48,260,000 
      class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$42,900,000 class D notes 
      'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$53,620,000 class E notes 'BB-sf'; 
      Outlook Stable.
    

      Subsequent to Fitch's presale publication, Ally Financial Inc. (AFIN) 
      decided to split the A-1 notes into classes A-1a and A-1b.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERSStable Collateral Characteristics: The 2015-3 
      pool is representative of nonprime collateral, with a 633 weighted 
      average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score, 8.8% WA APR and 105% WA 
      loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Of the pool, 60% consists of new vehicle 
      contracts, while extended-term contracts total 77%, all relatively 
      consistent with recent securitized pools.
    

      One-Year Revolving Period Risk: The revolving structure introduces risk 
      of collateral migrating to a weaker pool before the start of the 
      amortization period, although eligibility criteria pertaining to the 
      additional receivables may mitigate some of this risk. Fitch accounts 
      for collateral migration in its derivation of the base case loss proxy 
      for 2015-3.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      class A notes totals 19.5%. The non-declining reserve is 0.50%, 
      subordination totals 18.25% and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 
      0.75%, growing to a target of 2.25% after the revolving period. The 
      expected excess spread totals 5.08% per annum.
    

      Stable Portfolio Performance: AFIN's nonprime auto loan portfolio 
      performance has improved relative to the weak 2006?2008 period, given 
      the gradual improvements in the U.S. economy and health of the used 
      vehicle market. Fitch's base case loss proxy for 2015-3 is 5.50%. 
      However, Fitch's current CNL extrapolations for outstanding CARAT 
      transactions which have begun to amortize is 3.00% to 3.50%.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch currently rates AFIN 'BB+'/'B'/Outlook 
      Stable. AFIN demonstrates solid capabilities as an originator, 
      underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by its historical prime and 
      nonprime portfolios and securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AFIN would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of 
      defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss 
      levels higher than the base case. This in turn could result in Fitch 
      taking negative rating actions on the notes.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Capital Auto 
      Receivables Asset Trust 2015-3 to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses. This shows a 
      potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. 
      The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below 'Bsf') or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGEFitch was provided with third-party due 
      diligence information from Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due 
      diligence focused on comparing or re-computing certain information with 
      respect to 225 loans from the statistical data file. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an 
      impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link at the bottom of this rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled 'Capital Auto Receivables 
      Asset Trust 2015-3 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of 
      typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 03/31/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown include the reinvestment of all distributions. Returns shown at net asset value do not reflect the current maximum sales charge, had the sales charge been included, returns would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Portfolio Positioning as of 06/30/2017

The portfolio maintained its diversified exposure beyond the treasury bonds represented in its benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Bill Index.  The portfolio primarily invests in investment grade bonds with floating rate coupons, commercial paper, and AAA-rated asset-backed securities, all with short maturities.
The portfolio focuses on short maturity investment grade debt in an effort to generate higher total returns than cash or money market funds, with less interest rate risk than short or intermediate term bonds.
3-month LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) continued to rise, ending the quarter at 1.30%, 65 basis points higher than levels seen last summer. Higher LIBOR rates may benefit the strategy, as large portions of the portfolio have floating rate coupons tied to LIBOR.

To view definitions for the above Portfolio Details, Click here.




Average Coupon - The weighted average annual rate of interest on a bond’s face value that the issuer agrees to pay the holder until maturity for all the securities in a portfolio.




Average Maturity - The length of time until the average security in a portfolio will mature or be redeemed by its issuer in proportion to its dollar value. Indicating a portfolio’s sensitivity to general market interest rate changes, a longer average maturity implies greater relative portfolio volatility.




Average Effective Duration - The change in the value of a fixed income security that will result from a 1% change in interest rates, taking into account anticipated cash flow fluctuations from mortgage prepayments, puts, adjustable coupons, and potential call dates. Duration is expressed as a number of years, and generally, the larger a duration, the greater the interest-rate risk or reward for a portfolio’s underlying bond prices. Where applicable, certain investments, such as common or preferred stock, convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, ETFs, ADRs, and CPI swaps and related futures, are excluded from these calculations.

Expense ratio details, Click here.

The net expense ratio takes into account contractual fee waivers/expense reimbursements that currently are scheduled to remain in place through 03/31/2018. For periods when fees and expenses were waived and/or reimbursed, the Fund benefited by not bearing such expenses.  Without such fee waivers/reimbursements, performance would have been lower.

Minimum initial investment varies depending on the class of shares you buy and the type of account. IRAs, SIMPLEs, and SEP accounts with payroll deductions have no minimums. Please see Fund prospectuses for additional information.      
                    




1
Dividend Yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a mutual fund pays out in dividends each year relative to value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges. The dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the last dividend and dividing it by the fund’s net asset value with maximum sales charges and without sales charges.
 




2
The 30-Day Standardized Yield represents net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period. It is expressed as an annual percentage rate using a method of calculation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Yields for other share classes will vary.
 




3
The Fund’s Dividend Yield and 12-Month Dividend Yield are shown with and without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s Subsidized Dividend yield takes into account any fee waiver or expense limitation arrangements, if any. Without such fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements, the Fund’s dividend yield would have been lower. Information regarding any fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements applicable to the Fund is provided with the Fund’s expense ratio information.
 




4
The Fund’s Unsubsidized Dividend yield is shown without sales charges and with maximum sales charges. The Fund’s unsubsidized dividend yield reflects what the yield would have been without the effect of fee waivers or expense limitation arrangements.
 
 




5
The 30-day Standardized Subsidized yield reflects fee waivers in effect. Without such fee waivers, yields would be reduced.  
 




6
The 30-day Standardized Unsubsidized yield does not reflect fee waivers.






 
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

New Fund Risk: The Fund is newly organized. There can be no assurance that the Fund will reach or maintain a sufficient asset size to effectively implement its investing strategy.







headingView Disclosure




A Note about Risk: The Fund is subject to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, including market, credit, liquidity, and interest rate risk. The value of an investment in the Fund will change as interest rates fluctuate in response to market movements. When interest rates rise, the prices of debt securities are likely to decline, and when interest rates fall, the prices of debt securities tend to rise. Debt securities are subject to credit risk, which is the risk that the issuer will fail to make timely payments of interest and principal to the Fund. The Fund may invest in foreign or emerging market securities, which may be adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory factors and subject to currency volatility and greater liquidity risk. The Fund may invest in derivatives, which are subject to greater liquidity, leverage, and counterparty risk. Although the Fund may invest in money market securities, this is not a money market fund. These factors can affect Fund performance. As it is a newly organized fund, the Fund’s performance at this time is very limited. The Fund's performance achieved during its initial period of investment operation may not be replicated over longer periods and may not be indicative of how the Fund will perform in the future. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.







 
Performance data quoted is historical. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. To obtain performance data current to the most recent quarter-end, go to quarter ending performance on our Website or call Lord Abbett at (888) 522-2388.
 




Returns shown at less than a year reflect aggregate total returns.

Fund Expense Ratio Detail: Reflects expenses for the Fund's fiscal year-end and is subject to change. Fund expenses may fluctuate with market volatility. A substantial reduction in Fund assets (since its most recently completed fiscal year), whether caused by market conditions or significant redemptions or both, will likely cause total operating expenses (as a percentage of Fund assets) to become higher than those shown.
