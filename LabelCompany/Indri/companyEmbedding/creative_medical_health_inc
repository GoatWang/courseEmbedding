“I didn’t know what I needed to learn, or even where to start! I finally visited MedigapPolicies.com and found all my answers.” -Jim M., CO

What Is MedigapPolicies Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
Medicare Supplement Insurance is a private health insurance plan designed to cover the “gaps” left by basic Medicare Parts A & B. When you turn age 65 (or become eligible for disability benefits under age 65) you will obtain Medicare. Basic Medicare is broken down into two parts, consisting of “Part A” and “Part B”. Part A of Medicare is known as your basic hospital coverage. Part B of Medicare is known as your basic medical coverage. Both of these parts to Medicare only pay a portion of your healthcare expenses. That is why it is important to purchase additional Medicare Supplement Insurance to cover what Medicare does not.

Who Is Eligible For MedigapPolicies Insurance?
As long as you are covered under original Medicare Parts A & B, then you are “eligible” to purchase Medicare Supplemental Insurance. However, you may be subject to answering health questions. If you are within 6 months of initially getting your Medicare Part B coverage, or turning age 65, you will be guaranteed acceptance. Also, if you are losing group health insurance, or a similar situation, you may also be guaranteed acceptance into a Medicare Supplement Plan. In other situations, you may be required to answer health questions. In order to determine what you are eligible for, we advise to give us a call and we can explain your options. Call today at (844) 808-0176.
Where Do I Purchase MedigapPolicies Insurance?
You can purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance many different ways. Most consumers will initially complete much of the research necessary online in order to gain a better understanding of the options available to them. After you feel you are well informed and have been able to get price quotes on several different options, you will then decide to apply for a policy. We work with all of the top insurance agents and insurance companies across the country and can help assist you in purchasing almost any MedigapPolicies plan that you desire. The quickest way to compare plans & prices, and/or sign up is to fill out our online quote form and get started today!
What Is The Difference Between MedigapPolicies Insurance & Medicare Advantage?
A Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan and a Medicare Advantage Plan are two very different types of insurance that many individuals confuse as being the same. It is important to understand what each plan is and is not in order to purchase the best coverage for your needs. Put simply, a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan is a secondary insurance plan sold by private insurance companies. This plan type is designed to fill in the “gaps” left by original Medicare A & B. Again, Medicare does not cover 100% of everything, and so it is important to purchase a Medicare Supplement to fill those gaps. On the other hand, a Medicare Advantage Plan is a complete replacement of Medicare. If you sign up for this type of policy, you are agreeing to instead follow the rules and regulations of this new Medicare Advantage Company, not Medicare. Many times Medicare Advantage Plans will have networks of doctors, co-pays, deductibles, and more–whereas Medicare Supplement Plans typically have low to zero out of pocket costs other than the monthly premium.
When Can I Sign Up For MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Many people are under the misperception that you can only sign up for a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan at certain times throughout the year–this is not true. In fact, you can actually sign up for a Medicare Supplement Plan at any time throughout the year. However, there are some timeframes to be aware of. 1) There is the “Initial Enrollment Period” which is a one time only opportunity lasting 6 months from when you initially get Medicare Part B. During this 6 months, you can purchase any Medicare Supplement Plan through any company with guaranteed acceptance–regardless of your health. 2) If you are losing insurance coverage through an employer or in a similar situation, you may be eligible for a “Guaranteed Issue” period lasting 63 days, in which you can purchase a Medicare Supplement Insurance–again with no health questions asked. 3) The final way to purchase a Medicare Supplement Policy is simply to answer the health questions and go through medical underwriting. Call us today to learn more and get the process started at: (844) 808-0176.

Who Purchases MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Individuals from all walks of life can find Medicare Supplement Insurance to be a major benefit. Whether you are on a very low income, a low to moderate fixed income (like most seniors), or are wealthy–Medicare Supplement Insurance can be a great choice. One of the main reasons why it doesn’t matter your income as much is because Medicare’s coverage is standard–regardless of your financial status. Whether you are low income or a multi-millionaire, you still have a strong need to protect yourself from the large gaps leftover by Medicare. If Medicare Part B only covers 80% of your medical expenses, it will always be important to have insurance to cover the remaining 20%.
Important Fact: How To Save Money!
All 10 Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare, meaning coverage and benefits are identical between companies. Price is the only difference. Our best advice is to  compare plans online and save!

What Is MedigapPolicies Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
Medicare Supplement Insurance is a private health insurance plan designed to cover the “gaps” left by basic Medicare Parts A & B. When you turn age 65 (or become eligible for disability benefits under age 65) you will obtain Medicare. Basic Medicare is broken down into two parts, consisting of “Part A” and “Part B”. Part A of Medicare is known as your basic hospital coverage. Part B of Medicare is known as your basic medical coverage. Both of these parts to Medicare only pay a portion of your healthcare expenses. That is why it is important to purchase additional Medicare Supplement Insurance to cover what Medicare does not.

Who Is Eligible For MedigapPolicies Insurance?
As long as you are covered under original Medicare Parts A & B, then you are “eligible” to purchase Medicare Supplemental Insurance. However, you may be subject to answering health questions. If you are within 6 months of initially getting your Medicare Part B coverage, or turning age 65, you will be guaranteed acceptance. Also, if you are losing group health insurance, or a similar situation, you may also be guaranteed acceptance into a Medicare Supplement Plan. In other situations, you may be required to answer health questions. In order to determine what you are eligible for, we advise to give us a call and we can explain your options. Call today at (844) 808-0176.
Where Do I Purchase MedigapPolicies Insurance?
You can purchase Medicare Supplement Insurance many different ways. Most consumers will initially complete much of the research necessary online in order to gain a better understanding of the options available to them. After you feel you are well informed and have been able to get price quotes on several different options, you will then decide to apply for a policy. We work with all of the top insurance agents and insurance companies across the country and can help assist you in purchasing almost any MedigapPolicies plan that you desire. The quickest way to compare plans & prices, and/or sign up is to fill out our online quote form and get started today!
What Is The Difference Between MedigapPolicies Insurance & Medicare Advantage?
A Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan and a Medicare Advantage Plan are two very different types of insurance that many individuals confuse as being the same. It is important to understand what each plan is and is not in order to purchase the best coverage for your needs. Put simply, a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan is a secondary insurance plan sold by private insurance companies. This plan type is designed to fill in the “gaps” left by original Medicare A & B. Again, Medicare does not cover 100% of everything, and so it is important to purchase a Medicare Supplement to fill those gaps. On the other hand, a Medicare Advantage Plan is a complete replacement of Medicare. If you sign up for this type of policy, you are agreeing to instead follow the rules and regulations of this new Medicare Advantage Company, not Medicare. Many times Medicare Advantage Plans will have networks of doctors, co-pays, deductibles, and more–whereas Medicare Supplement Plans typically have low to zero out of pocket costs other than the monthly premium.
When Can I Sign Up For MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Many people are under the misperception that you can only sign up for a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan at certain times throughout the year–this is not true. In fact, you can actually sign up for a Medicare Supplement Plan at any time throughout the year. However, there are some timeframes to be aware of. 1) There is the “Initial Enrollment Period” which is a one time only opportunity lasting 6 months from when you initially get Medicare Part B. During this 6 months, you can purchase any Medicare Supplement Plan through any company with guaranteed acceptance–regardless of your health. 2) If you are losing insurance coverage through an employer or in a similar situation, you may be eligible for a “Guaranteed Issue” period lasting 63 days, in which you can purchase a Medicare Supplement Insurance–again with no health questions asked. 3) The final way to purchase a Medicare Supplement Policy is simply to answer the health questions and go through medical underwriting. Call us today to learn more and get the process started at: (844) 808-0176.

Who Purchases MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Individuals from all walks of life can find Medicare Supplement Insurance to be a major benefit. Whether you are on a very low income, a low to moderate fixed income (like most seniors), or are wealthy–Medicare Supplement Insurance can be a great choice. One of the main reasons why it doesn’t matter your income as much is because Medicare’s coverage is standard–regardless of your financial status. Whether you are low income or a multi-millionaire, you still have a strong need to protect yourself from the large gaps leftover by Medicare. If Medicare Part B only covers 80% of your medical expenses, it will always be important to have insurance to cover the remaining 20%.

What is Medicare Supplemental Insurance (a.k.a. Medigap)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medicare Supplemental insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medicare Supplement is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medicare Supplemental policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions. To learn more, and to get help going through the process, call us today at (888)-565-8918.
Who Purchases Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medicare supplement policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!

What is a Medicare Advantage Plan (a.k.a. Medicare Part C)?
Medicare Advantage is a private health insurance policy, underwritten by a private health insurance company, which replaces your Medicare coverage. With a Medicare Advantage plan, only the private company is responsible for paying your medical claims - the government is no longer responsible for those expenses. Legally, the private company has to provide you with "equal or better" coverage than what you would get under Original Medicare Parts A & B. Some plans go above and beyond Original Medicare by offering consumers additional benefits, such as vision, dental, and more. 
Who is Eligible for Medicare Advantage Plan?
If you are thinking about purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan, you can rest assured that you are highly likely to be accepted if:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

You may be able to apply during other times, but you will likely have to answer a lot of questions about your current health status. And even if you apply during any of the opportune time frames mentioned above, a company can still reject you for serious health conditions (such as kidney failure). For more clarification on your eligibility and options, give us a call today at (888)-565-8918.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Advantage Plan?
Unlike a Medicare supplement insurance policy, you can only sign up for a Medicare Advantage policy during certain times of the year. And those are:/p>
      	
The annual open enrollment period which spans October 15th - December 7th 
If you are on the verge of losing credible coverage, such as a group health insurance plan
Within 3 months of turning 65, or enrolling in Medicare Parts A & B

Still confused? We can help. Give is a call (888)-565-8918 and let our experts clear up and confusion you may have.
Who Purchases Medicare Advantage Plans?
Seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare Advantage policy. It really doesn't matter what level of income you have to work with. The reason for this is because Original Medicare only covers so much in the first place - there are still significant "gaps" in coverage which you will have to pay for out of pocket if you do not purchase additional insurance. And there are some Medicare Advantage plans that are available for zero premiums, which everyone can afford. 
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Advantage?
There are several different roads you can take, but we find that the best option is to shop around online for a Medicare Advantage policy. The internet is full of helpful information on potential companies, policies, and prices so that you can find the best possible option to suit your medical needs. Our company works with many of the top agencies in the market, and we can use those connections to help you get the Medicare Advantage policy that you require. All you have to do is fill out our online quote form, and we can get you started today!
Important Fact: How to Save Money!


What is the Difference between Medicare Supplement Insurance and Medicare Advantage?
Although it can be easy to confuse the two, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage insurance policies are two completely different plans. It is essential that seniors learn the difference between them. Here are some of the key differences to keep in mind:
Medigap

A private policy that works secondary to your government Medicare benefits
You keep the same doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles as Medicare
Low (or zero) out of pocket costs beyond the monthly premium

Medicare Advantage

A private policy that completely replaces your government Medicare benefits
Your doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles will likely be different from Medicare
Potentially high out of pocket costs, in addition to the monthly premium

How Can I Learn more about Medigap Insurance?
For more information, you should start your online quote comparison today. Our website can provide you this service for free. With such powerful information, it will be easy to see the differences in coverages and prices between top plans available in your area.

However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medigap policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions.

Who Purchases Medigap Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medigap Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medigap policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!

What is Medigap Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medigap insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medigap Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.

Tranquil Life™





Category: Nutritional Supplements.





Description



Product Description
Tranquil Life™: A Natural Formulation For Managing Stress and Anxiety
Tranquil Life™ is a nutritional supplement consisting of herbal ingredients and organic compounds that have been clinically demonstrated to alleviate anxiety and assist the body’s ability to cope with stress.
Tranquil Life™ contains the following ingredients that have been scientifically and clinically validated as having beneficial effects against anxiety:
 


Ashwaganda


Ashwagandha

Ashwaganda: This exotic Indian herb has been used in India for thousands of years as a rejuvenating tonifier and to support vitality. Ashwagandha is considered an “adaptogen” – a substance that helps the body adapt to physiological and psychological stress, having a balancing effect on the body’s systems and regulating the stress hormone-producing glands. Ashwagandha been demonstrated to be as effective as some tranquilizers and antidepressant drugs against anxiety and depression1.

Omega-3

Omega-3: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are known to have direct roles in brain physiology by providing protection against mood disorders, including stress, depression and anxiety2. In a clinical study, supplementation with fish oil for three weeks reduced the level of stress reported by subjects and reduced the levels of serum cortisol3. In studies where animals were under chronic stress, supplementation with omega-3 was observed to reduce physiological and behavioral stress symptoms4.
Hennebelle M et al. Influence of Omega-3 Fatty Acid Status on the Way Rats Adapt to Chronic Restraint Stress. PLoS One 2012;7(7):e42142.
The influence of omega-3 supplement on chronic as measured by body weight of animals. The results showed that animals fed an omega-3-enriched diet (stressed ENR) had lower stress-induced weight loss as compared to the control group that received a regular diet (stressed CON) and the group that had a diet deficient in omega-3 fatty acid (stressed DEF).

Passion Flower


Passion Flower

Passion flower (Passiflora incarnata L.): This plant is a traditional remedy for treating for anxiety, insomnia and hysteria. Passion flower promotes relaxation by stimulating the chemical gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain, having similar effects as the prescription drug diazepam, a tranquilizer5. The anti-anxiety effects of passion flower have been documented in numerous clinical studies.
Movafegh A et al. Preoperative oral Passiflora incarnata reduces anxiety in ambulatory surgery patients: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Anesth Analg 2008;106(6):1728.
Patients received either passion flower (orally; 500 mg) or placebo as premedication 90 minutes before surgery, and numerical rating scale (NRS) was used to assess anxiety before, and 10, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after premedication. The patients who received passion flower showed significantly lower anxiety scores than the control group who received placebo.

Skullcap


Skullcap

Skullcap (Scutellaria sp.): An herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine to calm tension, ease spasms and promote restfulness. Clinical studies have reported benefiical effects of skullcap for improving overall mood6 and for easing anxiety7.

St. John Wort


St. John Wort

St. John Wort (Hypericum perforatum): A small, yellow-flowered herb that acts on several neurotransmitter systems in the brain to alleviate depression and anxiety8. Through its effects as a “serotonin reuptake inhibitor”, this herb prevents neurons from reabsorbing serotonin, thereby increasing the availability of this neurotransmitter, which has positive effects on mood.

Magnesium

Magnesium: An essential dietary mineral that has been used as an oral supplement for its beneficial effects against depression9. Several conditions associated with anxiety are marked by low magnesium levels, and magnesium supplementation has been shown to improve moods and general well-being10,11.
Sartori SB et al. Magnesium deficiency induces anxiety and HPA axis dysregulation: Modulation by therapeutic drug treatment. Neuropharmacology 2012;62(1):304.
This study was performed in experimental animals to assess the correlation between magnesium deficiency and anxiety. The animals were fed either control diets (containing the daily magnesium requirement) or magnesium-deficient diets and were subjected to an elevated plus maze test where the numbers of entries into the open arm of the maze were measured (y-axis). Diazepam (DZP) or vehicle control (V) were used to treat the animals. The results showed that magnesium deficiency increased anxiety behavior in the animals, effects which were reversed by treatment with diazepam, an anti-anxiety medication.

Chamomile


Chamomile

Chamomile (Matricaria recutita): A flowering plant of the daisy family that is native to Europe and Asia and has been used as a traditional medicine for thousands of years to calm anxiety. Clinical studies support the ingestion of chamomile as a means for treating anxiety and for syndromes associated with both anxiety and depression12,13.
Amsterdam JD et al. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral Matricaria recutita (chamomile) extract therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. J Clin Psychopharmacol 2009;29(4):378.
In a double-blind study, patients with generalized anxiety disorder were treated with an oral extract of chamomile or placebo for 8 weeks. Chamomile treatment showed a statistically significant superiority over placebo at reducing the patients’ HAM-A scores (Hamilton anxiety rating) over time, which supports the conclusion that chamomile has anti-anxiety effects.

Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12: Since B vitamins are necessary for the proper functions of the nervous system, deficiencies in these vitamins can be associated with anxiety, restlessness and fatigue. Clinical evidence supports the association between low levels of vitamin B12 and mood disorders such as depression14.

L-trytophan

L-tryptophan: An essential amino acid that can be used as a supplement for medical conditions that can be associated with low levels of serotonin, including anxiety, depression and sleeplessness. Through a series of biochemical reactions, L-tryptophan is converted to serotonin, which transmits signals between nerve cells to elicit relaxing and mood-altering effects15. In a clinical study of healthy women, supplementation with tryptophan reportedly induced a positive bias in the processing of emotions that resembled the effects of anti-depressant medications16.
Monteiro-dos-Santos PC et al. Effects of tryptophan depletion on anxiety induced by simulated public speaking. Braz J Med Biol Res 2000;33(5):581.
Healthy subjects were given a control (tryptophan-containing) or tryptophan-free amino acid mixture and changes in their feelings and attitudes in a simulated public speaking test were evaluated using a self-rating scale. The tryptophan-containing supplement tended to increase the scores in the mood test.

Description



Product Description
Gluco Life ®: Natural Supplement For Diabetes Management
Gluco Life ® is a nutraceutical formulation that was researched and developed based on scientific properties of a blend of ingredients with activity for preventing and managing elevated blood glucose and diabetes-associated complications.
Nutritional Health for Diabetes: Diabetes arises as a result of the body’s inability to adequately cope with high blood glucose levels. In non-diabetic individuals, food consumption leads to the secretion of appropriate quantities of insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas that is secreted into the bloodstream. Insulin is required for the body to use convert glucose (sugar) from food into energy. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, excessive intake of carbohydrates creates a high demand for insulin; however, inadequate insulin production by the pancreas and resistance to the effects of insulin leads to sustained and high levels of glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia). The more uncontrolled the blood sugar levels are, the higher the risk and severity of complications, which include kidney damage, cardiovascular disease, eye disease and skin and mouth condition. A healthy diet including adequate intake of essential nutrients can make all the difference for keeping blood sugar levels under control and preventing diabetes-associated complications.
Scientific basis for Gluco Life ®: Contains plant-derived products that are scientifically proven to have beneficial effects in regulating blood glucose levels, improving insulin responses, and reducing multi-organ inflammation that is associated with hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.
 
Magnesium

Magnesium: A mineral involved in numerous metabolic reactions in the body including a cofactor for insulin production and glucose metabolism. Many studies have demonstrated that individuals with diabetes and at risk for this disease have chronically low magnesium levels and dietary supplementation with magnesium can help to control blood glucose1.

Chromium Picolinate

Chromium picolinate: Chromium is an essential mineral that is required for glucose metabolism that is coupled to picolinate to improve its absorption in the body. Experiments have demonstrated that chromium picolinate lowers blood glucose levels and reduces inflammation2.

Alpha Lipoic Acid

Alpha lipoic acid:  An antioxidant that helps turn glucose into energy by increasing the body’s sensitivity to insulin3. Also shown to improve symptoms of neuropathy (nerve damage) in patients with type 2 diabetes4.

Garcinia Indica


Garcinia Indica

Garcinia indica: The fruit rind from this Indian tree contains garcinol, an anti-oxidant compound that has been shown to inhibit production of inflammatory proteins caused by elevated glucose levels in blood5.

Holy Basil


Holy Basil

Holy basil: An herb native to India that has been shown to reduce fasting and postprandial (i.e. after eating a meal) blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes6.

Mormordica Charantia (Bitter Melon)


Bitter Melon

Momordica charantia (also called bitter melon or bitter gourd): Studies support the use of extracts from this tropical vegetable as dietary supplements for lowering blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes7. Experimental evidence supports a role in stimulating insulin secretion8.

Cinnamon


Cinnamon

Cinnamon: A spice obtained from the inner bark of several tropical evergreen trees that exerts anti-diabetic effects including increasing insulin production and reducing blood glucose levels9. Experiments suggested that cinnamon also has beneficial effects against two diabetes-related complications: diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage) and nephropathy (kidney disease).

Salacia Reticulata and Salacia Oblonga


Salacia Reticulata

Salacia reticulata and Salacia oblonga: Medicinal herbs that contain alpha-glucosidase inhibitors that slow carbohydrate absorption in the intestine, thereby reducing the rise in blood sugar following a meal10. Salacia inhibits aldose reductase, an enzyme that converts glucose into a sugar alcohol that accumulates in tissues and contributes to diabetic complications.

Gymnema Sylvestre


Gymnema Sylvestre

Gymnema sylvestre: A woody plant native to India that has been traditionally used to lower blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin secretion by pancreatic cells to allow for improved glucose metabolism11,12.

Nopal Cactus


Nopal Cactus

Nopal cactus (prickly pear cactus): Widely used in herbal medicine in Mexico, this vegetable is considered a super-food owing to its antioxidant properties. Nopal leaves contain a high content of fiber and pectin, which slows the digestive process and thereby regulates glucose absorption13.

Fenugreek


Fenugreek

Fenugreek: The seeds from this annual plant are used medicinally to reduced serum glucose and improve glucose tolerance14,15 as well as for ameliorating diabetes-related side effects16.

Vanadium

Vanadium: A trace mineral that has been demonstrated to lower blood glucose levels, to improve sensitivity to insulin in patients with diabetes, and to treat diabetic cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle) 17.

L-Carnitine

L-carnitine: A nutrient generated during the breakdown of amino acids that is involved in cellular energy metabolism. L-carnitine supplementation lowers fasting blood glucose levels18 and has been reported to improve nerve function in patients with diabetic neuropathy19.

Vitamin D3

Vitamin D3: This vitamin has broad roles in the maintenance of vital organs and the immune system including an essential role in insulin secretion by pancreatic cells 20. Vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects for improving blood glucose control in patients with diabetes21.

Creative Medical Health, Inc. Announces Brand Expansion



Share Article

















Creative Medical Health, Inc., a biotechnology holding company focused on regenerative medicine, announced it is now taking steps to increase its branding and its presence within the marketplace.







We’re excited for the opportunity to expand our sales and our brand reach to new levels,” said Tim Warbington, founder of Creative Medical Health, Inc


Boca Raton,Fl (PRWEB)
July 03, 2015
 Creative Medical Health, Inc., a biotechnology holding company focused on regenerative medicine, announced it is now taking steps to increase its branding and its presence within the marketplace.
Creative Medical Health takes a unique “science-first” approach to the way it formulates and develops its products. Its products make use of stem cell therapy in an effective, scientifically backed approach. With its new focus on marketing and expansion, the company will be able to reach a much greater number of potential customers and help them to benefit from their products.
“We’re excited for the opportunity to expand our sales and our brand to reach to new levels,” said Tim Warbington, founder of Creative Medical Health, Inc. “We strongly believe in the quality of our products, and can’t wait to get the word out about them even more. There are so many people out there who can benefit from these products, and we are looking forward to reaching out to them.”
Creative Medical Health began formulating 100 percent natural products several years ago under its Bionutraceutical® line. Its products under that line are the result of a great deal of stem cell and regenerative medicine research led by Dr. Amit Patel of the University of Utah, one of the world’s most highly regarded doctors in the field. The company benefits from a scientific mindset all the way through the process, from the conceptual stage to testing and beyond. 
The company’s line of sleep-assisting and anti-anxiety products were specifically formulated to target the central nervous system with natural herbs, nutrients and hormones to help relax the brain and body. As a result, these are products backed with a level of science and research nearly unprecedented in the marketplace.
“A great deal of hard work has gone into developing these products, and as a result they just work really well,” said Warbington. “People who suffer from sleep loss or anxiety deserve an effective, natural, scientifically backed solution to their problems. We’re looking forward to branching out further than ever before with our marketing and helping to make a difference in the lives of people across the world.”

Creative Medical Health Inc. Announces Creation of AngioStem Inc. Subsidiary to Commercialize Issued Cardiovascular Stem Cell Patent | Business Wire


























































Creative Medical Health Inc. Announces Creation of AngioStem Inc. 
      Subsidiary to Commercialize Issued Cardiovascular Stem Cell Patent






February 29, 2016 12:03 PM Eastern Standard Time



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Creative Medical Health announced today formation of a subsidiary 
      company, AngioStem Inc., dedicated to commercialization of its 
      cardiovascular assets, including issued US patent #9,205,112, titled 
      “Combination Therapy of Cardiovascular Disease.”
    


      The patent covers the use of autologous and allogeneic adult stem cells 
      such as cord blood and mesenchymal stem cells in combination with 
      modulation of oxidative stress in treatment of heart failure. 
      Additionally, the patent covers in-treatment assessment of oxidative 
      stress so as to give doctors the ability to personalize the treatment 
      protocol to the particular needs of the patient.
    

      “At Creative Medical Health, our mission is to identify promising 
      technologies, add value by strengthening the science and intellectual 
      property surrounding the technologies, and subsequently spin off new 
      companies with specialized management teams,” said Timothy Warbington, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Creative Medical Health. “The 
      development of a business strategy, the successful acquisition of 
      independent funding to implement the strategy, and the recruitment of a 
      management team to lead the strategy have positioned our cardiac stem 
      cell technology to evolve from a promising technology into a functioning 
      corporation.”
    

      Creative Medical Health owns a portfolio of technologies including an 
      issued patent on use of autologous bone marrow stem cells for erectile 
      dysfunction, currently in clinical trials, covered under patent 
      #8,372,797 and a variety of regenerative technologies treating 
      conditions including disc degeneration, male infertility, type 2 
      diabetes and multiple sclerosis.
    

      “I look forward to working with the management team of AngioStem to 
      bring stem cell technologies to patients who currently have no treatment 
      options available,” said Dr. Amit N. Patel, Director of Regenerative 
      Medicine and Tissue Engineering in the Department of Surgery at the 
      University of Utah, and founding Board Member of Creative Medical 
      Health. “The promise of stem cell therapeutics offers the possibility of 
      specifically utilizing cells of the body to accelerate healing. At 
      AngioStem the aim is to utilize stem cells to generate new blood 
      vessels, which may be applicable to conditions ranging from heart 
      failure, to peripheral artery disease, to stroke.”
    

      “Utilizing the clinical translational expertise of Dr. Amit Patel, our 
      previous company Medistem was successful at taking a stem cell product 
      from bench to bedside, resulting in a successful exit for our investors. 
      We intend to replicate the previous success at AngioStem,” said Thomas 
      Ichim, Ph.D., Founding Board Member of Creative Medical Health and 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of AngioStem.

Creative Medical Health, Inc. Announces Marketing Partnership with Nutritional Products International | Business Wire


























































Creative Medical Health, Inc. Announces Marketing Partnership with 
      Nutritional Products International




Brand pairs with international marketing and distribution firm






July 13, 2015 03:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time



PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Creative Medical Health, Inc., a biotechnology company focused on 
      regenerative medicine, announced it has entered into an agreement with 
      Nutritional Products International (NPI) to market and distribute its 
      line of Bionutraceutical® products in the USA and internationally.
    


      NPI is a company featuring the talents of professionals with decades of 
      experience in marketing and distribution of nutraceuticals, dietary 
      supplements, skin care products and more, both in the American market 
      and on the international stage.
    

      "We’re excited for the opportunity to work with NPI to expand our sales 
      and our brand reach. With NPI’s experience and extensive retail 
      relationships, our Bionutraceutical® brands can achieve new heights, 
      which is an incredible asset to our company," said Timothy Warbington, 
      Chief Executive Officer of Creative Medical Health, Inc.
    

      Creative Medical Health began formulating its scientifically based, 100% 
      natural products several years ago under its Bionutraceutical® 
      trademark. Creative Medical Health has 14 products in various stages of 
      development, clinical trials and commercialization. All of the 
      Bionutraceutical® products are the result of extensive research from 
      medical and scientific experts in the fields of regenerative medicine, 
      led by Dr. Amit Patel of the University of Utah, one of the world’s most 
      highly regarded doctors in the field. The company benefits from a 
      scientific mindset through the entire process, from concept to testing 
      and beyond. "We take the same approach in the development of our 
      Bionutraceutical® products as we do in the research, development and 
      testing of our medical (stem cell) procedures," said Dr. Annette 
      Marleau, Chief Scientific Officer at Creative Medical Health, Inc.
    

      The first two immediate commercial offerings, natural sleep-assisting (Natural 
      Rest®) and anti-anxiety (Tranquil Life®) products, are 
      specifically formulated to naturally aid the body in relaxing the 
      central nervous system, which will help in managing anxiety and loss of 
      sleep.
    

      “A great deal of hard work has gone into developing our 
      Bionutraceutical® products. As a result, our products are backed with a 
      level of science and research nearly unprecedented in the supplement 
      market,” said Timothy Warbington.
    

      For more information about Creative Medical Health and its products, 
      visit www.creativemedicalhealth.com.
    

      The products identified herein are not FDA approved and are not intended 
      to treat or cure any disease.

What Is MedigapPolicies Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
Medicare Supplement Insurance is a private health insurance plan designed to cover the “gaps” left by basic Medicare Parts A & B. When you turn age 65 (or become eligible for disability benefits under age 65) you will obtain Medicare. Basic Medicare is broken down into two parts, consisting of “Part A” and “Part B”. Part A of Medicare is known as your basic hospital coverage. Part B of Medicare is known as your basic medical coverage. Both of these parts to Medicare only pay a portion of your healthcare expenses. That is why it is important to purchase additional Medicare Supplement Insurance to cover what Medicare does not.

Also, if you are losing group health insurance, or a similar situation, you may also be guaranteed acceptance into a Medicare Supplement Plan. In other situations, you may be required to answer health questions. In order to determine what you are eligible for, we advise to give us a call and we can explain your options.

What Is The Difference Between MedigapPolicies Insurance & Medicare Advantage?
A Medicare Supplement Insurance Plan and a Medicare Advantage Plan are two very different types of insurance that many individuals confuse as being the same. It is important to understand what each plan is and is not in order to purchase the best coverage for your needs. Put simply, a Medicare Supplement Insurance plan is a secondary insurance plan sold by private insurance companies. This plan type is designed to fill in the “gaps” left by original Medicare A & B. Again, Medicare does not cover 100% of everything, and so it is important to purchase a Medicare Supplement to fill those gaps. On the other hand, a Medicare Advantage Plan is a complete replacement of Medicare. If you sign up for this type of policy, you are agreeing to instead follow the rules and regulations of this new Medicare Advantage Company, not Medicare. Many times Medicare Advantage Plans will have networks of doctors, co-pays, deductibles, and more–whereas Medicare Supplement Plans typically have low to zero out of pocket costs other than the monthly premium.
When Can I Sign Up For MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Many people are under the misperception that you can only sign up for a Medicare Supplemental Insurance plan at certain times throughout the year–this is not true. In fact, you can actually sign up for a Medicare Supplement Plan at any time throughout the year. However, there are some timeframes to be aware of. 1) There is the “Initial Enrollment Period” which is a one time only opportunity lasting 6 months from when you initially get Medicare Part B. During this 6 months, you can purchase any Medicare Supplement Plan through any company with guaranteed acceptance–regardless of your health. 2) If you are losing insurance coverage through an employer or in a similar situation, you may be eligible for a “Guaranteed Issue” period lasting 63 days, in which you can purchase a Medicare Supplement Insurance–again with no health questions asked. 3) The final way to purchase a Medicare Supplement Policy is simply to answer the health questions and go through medical underwriting. Call us today to learn more and get the process started at: (844) 808-0176.

Who Purchases MedigapPolicies Insurance?
Individuals from all walks of life can find Medicare Supplement Insurance to be a major benefit. Whether you are on a very low income, a low to moderate fixed income (like most seniors), or are wealthy–Medicare Supplement Insurance can be a great choice. One of the main reasons why it doesn’t matter your income as much is because Medicare’s coverage is standard–regardless of your financial status. Whether you are low income or a multi-millionaire, you still have a strong need to protect yourself from the large gaps leftover by Medicare. If Medicare Part B only covers 80% of your medical expenses, it will always be important to have insurance to cover the remaining 20%.

What Is MedigapPolicies Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
Medicare Supplement Insurance is a private health insurance plan designed to cover the “gaps” left by basic Medicare Parts A & B. When you turn age 65 (or become eligible for disability benefits under age 65) you will obtain Medicare. Basic Medicare is broken down into two parts, consisting of “Part A” and “Part B”. Part A of Medicare is known as your basic hospital coverage. Part B of Medicare is known as your basic medical coverage. Both of these parts to Medicare only pay a portion of your healthcare expenses. That is why it is important to purchase additional Medicare Supplement Insurance to cover what Medicare does not.

What is Medicare Supplemental Insurance (a.k.a. Medigap)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medicare Supplemental insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medicare Supplement is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

Who Purchases Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
It doesn't matter whether you're struggling to get by, on a fixed income, or enjoying incredible wealth in your golden years - all seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare supplement insurance policy. Medicare provides standard coverage to every beneficiary, regardless of income. What it does not provide, however, is 100% coverage of your medical costs. Therefore, the more vulnerable you are to the gaps in Medicare coverage, the more you can benefit from the protection of a Medigap policy.
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Supplemental Insurance?
You, as a consumer, have a variety of options. While some prefer to look up nearby agents in their local Yellow Pages, the truth is that you'll get the best deal by doing your research and shopping around online. With the power of the internet, you can get more and better offers from several major companies who are all competing for your business.
You could contact each and every individual agency by yourself and spend hours filling out the same redundant online forms for quotes, or you can let us do all of the busy work for you. Compare multiple plans, prices, and agencies by filling out our one, simple online quote form today. We can help you get the best possible deal on virtually any available Medicare supplement policy.
Important Fact: How to Save Money!
All 10 available Medicare Supplement Plans are standardized by Medicare - this means that each plan offers identical benefits, regardless of where you live or what company is handling your policy. Therefore, the only difference is in price. And the best way to get the best price is to compare plans online and save!

Medicare Supplement vs. Medicare Advantage?




Who Is Medigap.com

With the help of our convenient, user-friendly website, you can compare plans, learn about benefits, and shop for the best deal amongst the best Medicare insurance companies in the country. Our website is ranked in the top 5 out of thousands of Medicare insurance comparison websites. If you are ready to start your free quote today, we can help.
What is a Medicare Advantage Plan (a.k.a. Medicare Part C)?
Medicare Advantage is a private health insurance policy, underwritten by a private health insurance company, which replaces your Medicare coverage. With a Medicare Advantage plan, only the private company is responsible for paying your medical claims - the government is no longer responsible for those expenses. Legally, the private company has to provide you with "equal or better" coverage than what you would get under Original Medicare Parts A & B. Some plans go above and beyond Original Medicare by offering consumers additional benefits, such as vision, dental, and more. 
Who is Eligible for Medicare Advantage Plan?
If you are thinking about purchasing a Medicare Advantage plan, you can rest assured that you are highly likely to be accepted if:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

You may be able to apply during other times, but you will likely have to answer a lot of questions about your current health status. And even if you apply during any of the opportune time frames mentioned above, a company can still reject you for serious health conditions (such as kidney failure). For more clarification on your eligibility and options, give us a call today at (888)-565-8918.


When Can I Sign Up for Medicare Advantage Plan?
Unlike a Medicare supplement insurance policy, you can only sign up for a Medicare Advantage policy during certain times of the year. And those are:/p>
      	
The annual open enrollment period which spans October 15th - December 7th 
If you are on the verge of losing credible coverage, such as a group health insurance plan
Within 3 months of turning 65, or enrolling in Medicare Parts A & B

Still confused? We can help. Give is a call (888)-565-8918 and let our experts clear up and confusion you may have.
Who Purchases Medicare Advantage Plans?
Seniors from all walks of life can benefit from a Medicare Advantage policy. It really doesn't matter what level of income you have to work with. The reason for this is because Original Medicare only covers so much in the first place - there are still significant "gaps" in coverage which you will have to pay for out of pocket if you do not purchase additional insurance. And there are some Medicare Advantage plans that are available for zero premiums, which everyone can afford. 
Where Do I Purchase Medicare Advantage?
There are several different roads you can take, but we find that the best option is to shop around online for a Medicare Advantage policy. The internet is full of helpful information on potential companies, policies, and prices so that you can find the best possible option to suit your medical needs. Our company works with many of the top agencies in the market, and we can use those connections to help you get the Medicare Advantage policy that you require. All you have to do is fill out our online quote form, and we can get you started today!
Important Fact: How to Save Money!


What is the Difference between Medicare Supplement Insurance and Medicare Advantage?
Although it can be easy to confuse the two, Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage insurance policies are two completely different plans. It is essential that seniors learn the difference between them. Here are some of the key differences to keep in mind:
Medigap

A private policy that works secondary to your government Medicare benefits
You keep the same doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles as Medicare
Low (or zero) out of pocket costs beyond the monthly premium

Medicare Advantage

A private policy that completely replaces your government Medicare benefits
Your doctors, networks, co-pays, and deductibles will likely be different from Medicare
Potentially high out of pocket costs, in addition to the monthly premium

How Can I Learn more about Medigap Insurance?
For more information, you should start your online quote comparison today. Our website can provide you this service for free. With such powerful information, it will be easy to see the differences in coverages and prices between top plans available in your area. Of course, if you have any questions, you can call our Medicare Advantage specialists directly by calling (888)-565-8918.

What is Medigap Insurance (a.k.a. Medicare Supplement)?
When an American citizen turns 65 years of age, they have the option to enroll in Medicare (they may also qualify before the age of 65 if they are eligible for disability benefits). Basic Medicare, which includes Parts A and B, cover most of your basic hospital and doctor expenses, respectively. Unfortunately, "most" does not mean "all". The expenses which Medicare does not cover - sometimes referred to as "gaps" in coverage - are what Medigap insurance protects you from. It is a private plan designed to cover the medical expenses where Traditional Medicare falls short of the mark.
Who is Eligible for Medigap Insurance?
If any of the following scenarios apply to you, then you are already guaranteed "eligible" to purchase Medicare supplemental insurance:

You are currently covered under Medicare Parts A & B
You are within 6 months of turning 65
You are within 6 months of receiving Part B coverage
If you are about to lose your group health insurance plan

Please note that you may still be required to answer some medical questions about your overall health and wellness. For further clarification, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us at (888)-565-8918. Give us a call today.


When Can I Sign Up for Medigap Insurance?
Based on the convoluted rules of Medicare enrollment, many seniors mistakenly believe that signing up for Medigap is similarly complicated. The good news is that you can sign up for Medigap insurance at any time. However, there are some "sweet spot" time frames which, if you apply during those opportunities, will make the process much easier:

The Initial Enrollment Period. During your first 6 months of Part B coverage, your acceptance is guaranteed, regardless of your current level of health
The "Guaranteed Issue" Period. If you are on the verge of losing coverage through an employer, you will have a "guaranteed issue" period lasting 63 days where you can purchase any Medigap policy with no health questions asked.

If you apply for Medicare supplement at any point outside of these time frames, you will likely have to go through the complicated process of medical underwriting and answering lots of invasive health questions.

All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
