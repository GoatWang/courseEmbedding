Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

Navy Federal Credit Union nRewards® Credit Card


                                            I thought this was a good program until I tried to order a Yeti cooler on the members mall and every cooler in every size was out of stock. So I ordered $400 in gift cards instead to purchase the item at a retailer. After about 3 weeks of waiting the cards never showed up. I...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report.
