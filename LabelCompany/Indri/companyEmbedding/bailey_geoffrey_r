Franchise Info



Good Times offers a concept that serves success, opportunity and fun. We provide our franchisees with a high level of support and personal care throughout the franchise process. Good Times seeks both individual and multi-unit development franchisees for development in western and mid-western markets.
Good Times is currently limiting franchise opportunities to those candidates who possess both the financial capacity and business experience, preferably with an operating partner with experience in the quick service restaurant industry. Good Times provides training teams; real estate, design and construction support; operations support; product development; marketing support and, purchasing programs. We are very selective when awarding a Good Times franchise. We want this to be more than a fifteen year business relationship and we want it to be a rewarding endeavor for both parties.
*Traditional franchise site, this may change for special venues or licensee arrangements based on a variety of conditions and variables.
Legal Disclaimer: This information is not intended for an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy a franchise. It is for informational purposes only. California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin regulate the offer and sale of franchises. If you are a resident of one of these states we will not offer you a franchise unless and until we have complied with applicable pre-sale registration and disclosure rights in your jurisdiction.


Basic requirements to own a Good Times franchise:

The term of a Good Times franchise is 15 years, plus renewal options
A minimum of $300,000 in liquid assets (not including your home, personal items or borrowed funds) and a net worth of $750,000
You or your Operating Partner must have prior or current successful restaurant experience
Royalty fees are 4% of gross sales*
Advertising fees range from 3.5% to 5.5% of gross sales

Markets available for franchising:
A potential Good Times site should have a high daytime employment and retail activity, traffic count of at least 20,000 cars per day, business and strong residential population and not be a seasonal tourist destination.
Franchise Facts:

Good Times must approve all potential sites. We will assist you in site selection, architectural and construction, supplier selection, equipment, grand opening promotion and advertising.
Good Times does not provide financing. We may assist qualified persons by recommending a third party lender.
Good Times provides pre-opening training and materials and on-site opening support.

If you feel you are a qualified candidate, please contact our franchise department, goodtimes@gtrestaurants.com, to obtain additional information, including a confidential application.
