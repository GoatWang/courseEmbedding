Bulldog Investors General Partnership v. Massachusetts




The Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act prohibits general
solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered
securities, ostensibly for the purpose of furthering state and
federal disclosure schemes. Yet this ban on public communications
has been applied so broadly that it has undermined those purported
disclosure goals. For instance, the ban has prevented individuals
who have no interest in investing in any security—such as
journalists, academics, students, and others who are not wealthy or
financially sophisticated—from receiving truthful,
non-misleading information about hedge funds. In Bulldog
Investors v. Massachusetts, an investment company maintained
an interactive website that provided information about its
products. Because Bulldog was not registered in Massachusetts,
however, the State filed an administrative action against the firm,
demanding it take down its online content. In response, Bulldog
joined a group of other firms and individuals—including some
who have no interest in investing but wish to read the website
information—in a lawsuit claiming that the Massachusetts ban
violates their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Judicial Court
of Massachusetts upheld the ban, so the plaintiffs have asked the
U.S. Supreme Court to take the case. Cato, along with the
Competitive Enterprise Institute and a group of journalists and
academics, filed an amicus brief supporting that request
and arguing that the Massachusetts law is an unconstitutional ban
on free speech. We show that the state’s claim that the ban
furthers a larger federal regulatory scheme ignores the judgment of
many federal officials (from both parties) who have concluded that
such bans undermine these goals. The state’s alleged
disclosure interest is just a pretext for coercing companies to
register in Massachusetts, and is therefore an unconstitutional
attempt at circumventing federal preemption. But even if the ban
furthers a legitimate state interest, it is so broad that it is has
substantially chilled both truthful, non-misleading commercial
speech and noncommercial speech alike. A law so repugnant to the
First Amendment cannot stand.

Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts,Suffolk.
BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP & others 1
             v. SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
SJC-10589.
    Decided: July 02, 2010

		Present: Marshall, C.J., Ireland, Spina, Cowin, Cordy, & Gants, JJ.Andrew Good (Philip G. Cormier with him) for the plaintiffs. Pierce O. Cray, Assistant Attorney General (Peter W. Cassidy with him) for the defendant.
A hearing officer in the Securities Division (division) of the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) found that the plaintiffs violated G.L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (act), by offering unregistered securities to a Massachusetts resident via electronic mail (e-mail). The plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling, and a judge in the Superior Court affirmed. The plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the Commonwealth were insufficient to permit the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them, that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech, and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act. We conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process, that the constitutional claim is not properly before us, and that the Secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act. Unlike at common law, where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offeree's affirmative response would conclude a bargain, the act defines an “offer” more broadly to include the “solicitation of an offer.” See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). Thus, the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a Massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities.1. Facts and procedural history. We summarize the facts found by the hearing officer, supplemented with undisputed facts from the record. From approximately June 9, 2005, through January 5, 2007, Bulldog Investors General Partnership (Bulldog) operated an interactive Web site that provided information about investment products it offered for sale. Users could obtain more specific information about Bulldog's “hedge funds” by registering with the site.On November 10, 2006, Brendan Hickey, a Massachusetts resident, registered by providing Bulldog with his name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Steven Samuels, a Bulldog employee, responded to Hickey's registration with an e-mail message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs' hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog's partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs' investment philosophy and strategy. Samuels also invited Hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss Bulldog's funds in greater detail.On January 31, 2007, the Secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs2 alleging that Bulldog's Web site and e-mail contact with Hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration, in violation of the act. See G.L. c. 110A, § 301. In their answer, the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses (1) that the act and the Secretary's regulations violated the plaintiffs' right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (2) that in any event the Secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. The Secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 10.02(b)(8) (1993).The Secretary moved for summary decision, arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. In response, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G.L. c. 12, § 11I, asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech.3 The plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding pending resolution of the First Amendment claim in the Superior Court; the hearing officer denied the request. She stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs' First Amendment right.4 The hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the Commonwealth. In addition, she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement. Finally, the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction. She recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a $25,000 fine.The acting director of the division (acting director) adopted the hearing officer's recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions.5 The plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting director's determination in the Superior Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings. See G.L. c. 30A, § 14; G.L. c. 110A, § 411. See also Standing Order 1-96(4) of the Rules of the Superior Court (2002) (“A claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings ․”). In a thoughtful memorandum of decision, a judge in the Superior Court6 denied the motion and affirmed the acting director's ruling. The judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process. In addition, she held that, after having chosen to use the separate 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14. The plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.2. Standard of review. Pursuant to G.L. c. 110A, § 411, “[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review.” See G.L. c. 30A, § 14. We reverse the Secretary's decision only if it was “(a ) [i]n violation of constitutional provisions”; “(b ) [i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction” of the Secretary; “(c ) [b]ased upon an error of law”; “(d ) [m]ade upon unlawful procedure”; “(e ) [u]nsupported by substantial evidence”; “(f ) [u]nwarranted by facts found by the court ․ where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact”; or “(g ) [a]rbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” See G.L. c. 30A, § 14(7).3. Discussion. The plaintiffs contend that the Web site and the single e-mail message to Hickey were insufficient contacts with the Commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the Secretary. They claim that the act does not authorize the Secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of Massachusetts law.The plaintiffs contend also that “[t]he Secretary's order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction,” in violation of the First Amendment and art. 16. They argue in addition that their Web site and e-mail message did not constitute an “offer” within the meaning of the act. See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). They contend that the communication to Hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the e-mail message. In addition, they contend that Hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the Web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitation.The Secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case. He argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts. Furthermore, he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act. Additionally, the Secretary contends that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is waived, and that, even if not waived, the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them. Finally, the Secretary argues that the plaintiffs' communication with Hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the act's definition of an offer; he notes that the act's definition of the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition.a. Personal jurisdiction. For a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts, there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be “consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the United States Constitution.” Intech, Inc. v. Triple “C” Marine Salvage, Inc., 444 Mass. 122, 125, 826 N.E.2d 194 (2005), quoting Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 767, 625 N.E.2d 549 (1994). We analyze each requirement separately.i. Statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction. In court proceedings, personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our long-arm statute, G.L. c. 223A, § 3, is satisfied. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, 447 Mass. 860, 862-863, 857 N.E.2d 1089 (2006). By its terms, the long-arm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3.7 However, the long-arm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. The text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceeding.The act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the Commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are Federal “covered” securities. See G.L. c. 110A, § 301. The definition of “offer” includes not only offers that originate within the Commonwealth but also ones directed into the Commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed. See G.L. c. 110A, § 414 (c ). The Secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the Commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred. See G.L. c. 110A, § 407 (a ). He also has broad authority to remedy “a violation of any provision” of the act by “any person” by imposing cease and desist orders or fines. See G.L. c. 110A, § 407A (a ). These provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect Massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions. These protections and the Secretary's authority to conduct investigations outside the Commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedings.Furthermore, the act provides that, where personal jurisdiction “cannot otherwise be obtained in the Commonwealth,” any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the Secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct. See G.L. c. 110A, § 414 (h ). This authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred. Interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity. See Flemings v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 431 Mass. 374, 375-376, 727 N.E.2d 1147 (2000) (“If a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results”).8 ii. Due process. “ ‘The constitutional touchstone’ of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process ‘remains whether the defendant established “minimum contacts” in the forum state.’ ”  Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 772, 625 N.E.2d 549 (1994), quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985). The due process analysis entails three requirements. First, minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.”  Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra, quoting Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 108-109, 107 S.Ct. 1026, 94 L.Ed.2d 92 (1987). Second, the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendant's contacts with the forum. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Third, “the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra at 773, 625 N.E.2d 549, quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945).By contacting Hickey, the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in Massachusetts and invoked the protection of Massachusetts law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra (solicitation of business in Massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of Massachusetts law). Because the plaintiffs operated a Web site accessible in Massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by Massachusetts law to a Massachusetts resident, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in Massachusetts. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980) (“the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis ․ is [whether] the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there”).At the time of their communication with Hickey, the plaintiffs were on notice that Hickey was a resident of Massachusetts. Additionally, the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into Massachusetts is unlawful. See G.L. c. 110A, §§ 301, 414 (a ), (c ). By soliciting purchases of their hedge funds, the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with Hickey. Therefore, it would be unfair “to escape having to account in [Massachusetts] for consequences that arise proximately from such activities.” Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 473-474.The plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, Inc., 447 Mass. 860, 861-862, 865, 857 N.E.2d 1089 (2006); Droukas v. Divers Training Academy, Inc., 375 Mass. 149, 151, 157, 376 N.E.2d 548 (1978). These cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the long-arm statute. They did not address the due process question.The second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case. It is undisputed that the Secretary's enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs' contacts with Massachusetts. Finally, exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice. In determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied, we weigh the Commonwealth's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the burden on the out-of-State party of litigating in Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 476-477. Massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of Massachusetts securities law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in Massachusetts, such inconvenience does not outweigh the Commonwealth's interest in enforcing its laws in a Massachusetts forum.The plaintiffs contend that, even if the Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over Bulldog, he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs. The Secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible. See Miller v. Miller, 448 Mass. 320, 325, 861 N.E.2d 393 (2007). Because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff, that burden has been met here.In the administrative complaint, the Secretary alleged that Hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through e-mail. In their answer to the administrative complaint, each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via e-mail to Hickey. While some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication, the Secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits. See Walker v. Georgetown Housing Auth., 424 Mass. 671, 672 n. 3, 677 N.E.2d 1125 (1997).9 Because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction, the Secretary's finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence.10 b. First Amendment claim. The plaintiffs argue that “[t]he Secretary's order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction.” The Secretary contends that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim has been waived, and that, even if it has not been waived, the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speech.The plaintiffs initially asserted their First Amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint. The hearing officer declined to rule on this issue; instead, she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court. The hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and, as such, beyond the authority of the Secretary to adjudicate. See Gurry v. Board of Public Accountancy, 394 Mass. 118, 126, 474 N.E.2d 1085 (1985).In response to the hearing officer's position, the plaintiffs litigated the First Amendment issue in a separate action in the Superior Court in which they asserted violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.11 The plaintiffs did not raise the First Amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case, brought pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14. They did plead the issue and litigate it in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. In these unusual circumstances, the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim.c. Violation of the act. The Secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs' e-mail message to Hickey violated the act. The act defines an offer to include the “solicitation of an offer.” See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). Thus, as stated, for the purposes of the act, the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition.12 The e-mail message sent to Hickey, and the materials attached to it, contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs' hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog's partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs' investment philosophy and strategy. It is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in Bulldog's funds. Thus, the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities. See I & R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 62 Mass.App.Ct. 452, 455, 817 N.E.2d 799 (2004) (advertisements are usually considered requests for offers). See also 1 Williston, Contracts § 4:10, at 475 (4th ed.2007).The plaintiffs contend that because Hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase Bulldog's securities, the e-mail communication cannot constitute an offer. Because in this context the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition, see G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2), it is not required that the plaintiffs' communication be such that Hickey's assent would have concluded a bargain. See note 12, supra.Additionally, the disclaimers posted on the Web site do not defeat liability. In order to access certain parts of the Web site, users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the Web site does not constitute a solicitation and the Web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. However, the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their Web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer. The presence of a disclaimer asserting that the Web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive; the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs' communication with Hickey was an offer or a solicitation. Cf. LeMaitre v. Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., 452 Mass. 753, 756, 897 N.E.2d 1218 (2008); Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 744, 729 N.E.2d 1113 (2000). Here, as stated, the materials sent to Hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing Bulldog's securities. Most importantly, the e-mail message sent to Hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the Web site. For these reasons, the e-mail message sent to Hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act.4. Conclusion. The Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs, and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct. Therefore, the decision of the Superior Court, affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine, was also correct.Judgment affirmed.COWIN, J.

Bulldog Investors General Partnership v Secretary of Commonwealth

Case No. SJC-10756 (MA S. Jud. Ct., Sep. 22, 2011)


		  		    On January 31, 2007, the Enforcement Section of the Securities Division of the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) filed an administrative complaint alleging that three "hedge funds" offered by Bulldog Investors General Partnership operating under the trade name "Bulldog Investors" had violated § 301 of G.L. c. 110A of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (Massachusetts act) by offering unregistered securities to a Massachusetts resident through a publicly available Web site and an electronic mail (e-mail) message. The respondents to this enforcement action included the Bulldog Investors General Partnership and various general partners and principals (collectively, Bulldog). [FN2] The Secretary adopted the hearing officer's finding of a violation, and ordered Bulldog to cease and desist from committing any further violations of the Massachusetts act and to take all necessary actions to ensure that future offers and sales of securities complied with § 301 of the Massachusetts act.    

Bulldog filed two actions challenging the administrative decision. One action sought judicial review pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14, claiming that Bulldog's contacts with the Commonwealth were insufficient to permit the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction, that Bulldog's communications with the Massachusetts resident did not offer unregistered securities in violation of the Massachusetts act, and that the Secretary's enforcement proceeding and order violated Bulldog's constitutional right to free speech. See Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 457 Mass. 210, 213-214 (2010) (Bulldog I ). The second action, the case now before us on appeal, sought relief under the Federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006), from what Bulldog contends was the violation of free speech and due process rights guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Leonard Bloness (Bloness), who has no interest in investing in any Bulldog security but wishes to read the information that was contained in Bulldog's Web site and receive other information about Bulldog's securities, is also a plaintiff in the § 1983 action.   

In the G.L. c. 30A, § 14, action, a judge in the Superior Court entered judgment affirming the Secretary's final order and we affirmed that judgment, concluding that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process, and that the Secretary correctly determined that the plaintiffs violated the Massachusetts act by sending to a Massachusetts resident materials that constituted an offer of unregistered securities. Bulldog I, supra at 211. We also concluded that Bulldog's First Amendment claim was not properly before us where the plaintiffs had chosen to bring a separate § 1983 action in order to raise that claim, rather than press it in their G.L. c. 30A, § 14, action. Id. at 211, 220.   

In the § 1983 case, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' due process claims, which were based on a claimed lack of personal jurisdiction, and conducted a bench trial on the First Amendment claims. The evidence at trial consisted of the parties' stipulations of fact; the administrative record and other agreed-on exhibits; and the testimony and report of the Secretary's expert witness, Professor Joseph A. Franco, an expert on securities regulation. In a carefully reasoned decision, the judge concluded that the challenged statute, regulations, and enforcement action did not violate the First Amendment rights of Bulldog or Bloness, and entered a declaratory judgment for the Secretary. The plaintiffs appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We now affirm.

BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP & others [Note 1] vs. SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
460 Mass. 647
January 6, 2011 - September 22, 2011
Court Below: Superior Court, Suffolk
Present: IRELAND, C.J., SPINA, CORDY, BOTSFORD, & GANTS, JJ.


Securities. Uniform Securities Act. Constitutional Law, Freedom of speech and

press. Advertising. Secretary of the Commonwealth. Words, "Commercial speech," 

"Noncommercial speech."




Discussion of the Federal Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a et seq., which prohibits general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities [652-655], and of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, which largely tracks the requirements of Federal securities law [655-656]. 




In a civil action brought in Superior Court by plaintiffs alleging that Federal and State securities laws that prohibited general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities were overbroad and violated constitutional free speech rights, the judge did not err in concluding that the challenged statute, regulations, and enforcement action against the plaintiffs did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, where, although the plaintiffs' communications concerning financial products, management, and investment philosophy were speech protected by the First Amendment [656-658], they plainly constituted commercial speech [658-660] properly subject to a disclosure scheme that not only was reasonably related to the State's interest in promoting the integrity of capital markets by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information [660-668], but also directly advanced that substantial government interest and were not more extensive than was necessary to serve that interest [668-676]; further, the enforcement of the challenged provisions did not constitute an independent First Amendment violation of the right of an investor to receive information [678-681]. 




There was no merit to a claim that certain State and Federal securities regulations restricted fully protected, noncommercial speech in violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, where the challenged provisions restricted the speech of an issuer of securities only where it was designed to solicit an offer to purchase securities, a prohibition that did not include a substantial amount of noncommercial speech relative to the plainly legitimate sweep of the provisions. [676-678]

        CIVIL ACTION commenced in the Superior Court Department on March 23, 2007.   




        The case was heard by Judith Fabricant, J.   




        The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the case from the Appeals Court.   




        Lawrence Tribe (Alan S. Lewis, of New York, & Andrew Good with him) for the plaintiffs.   




        Pierce O. Cray, Assistant Attorney General, for the defendant.   




        Lee Tien & Adam Kessel, for John Berlau & others, amici curiae, submitted a brief.   




 GANTS, J.   On January 31, 2007, the Enforcement Section of the Securities Division of the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) filed an administrative complaint alleging that three "hedge funds" offered by Bulldog Investors General Partnership operating under the trade name "Bulldog Investors" had violated § 301 of G. L. c. 110A of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (Massachusetts act) by offering unregistered securities to a Massachusetts resident through a publicly available Web site and an electronic mail (e-mail) message. The respondents to this enforcement action included the Bulldog Investors General Partnership and various general partners and principals (collectively, Bulldog). [Note 2] The Secretary adopted the hearing officer's finding of a violation, and ordered Bulldog to cease and desist from committing any further violations of the Massachusetts act and to take all necessary actions to ensure that future offers and sales of securities complied with § 301 of the Massachusetts act. [Note 3]   


Page 649


        Bulldog filed two actions challenging the administrative decision. One action sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, § 14, claiming that Bulldog's contacts with the Commonwealth were insufficient to permit the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction, that Bulldog's communications with the Massachusetts resident did not offer unregistered securities in violation of the Massachusetts act, and that the Secretary's enforcement proceeding and order violated Bulldog's constitutional right to free speech. See Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 457 Mass. 210 , 213-214 (2010) (Bulldog I). The second action, the case now before us on appeal, sought relief under the Federal civil rights statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2006), from what Bulldog contends was the violation of free speech and due process rights guaranteed under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Leonard Bloness (Bloness), who has no interest in investing in any Bulldog security but wishes to read the information that was contained in Bulldog's Web site and receive other information about Bulldog's securities, is also a plaintiff in the § 1983 action.   




        In the G. L. c. 30A, § 14, action, a judge in the Superior Court entered judgment affirming the Secretary's final order and we affirmed that judgment, concluding that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process, and that the Secretary correctly determined that the plaintiffs violated the Massachusetts act by sending to a Massachusetts resident materials that constituted an offer of unregistered securities. Bulldog I, supra at 211. We also concluded that Bulldog's First Amendment claim was not properly before us where the plaintiffs had chosen to bring a separate § 1983 action in order to raise that claim, rather than press it in their G. L. c. 30A, § 14, action. Id. at 211, 220.   




        In the § 1983 case, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs' due process claims, which were based on a claimed lack of personal jurisdiction, and conducted a bench trial on the First Amendment claims. The evidence at trial consisted of the parties' stipulations of fact; the administrative record and other agreed-on 


Page 650


exhibits; and the testimony and report of the Secretary's expert witness, Joseph A. Franco, an expert on securities regulation. In a carefully reasoned decision, the judge concluded that the challenged statute, regulations, and enforcement action did not violate the First Amendment rights of Bulldog or Bloness, and entered judgment for the Secretary. The plaintiffs appealed, and we transferred the appeal to this court on our own motion. We now affirm. [Note 4], [Note 5]   




        I. Factual background. The following facts were found by the judge or are undisputed in the record. From about June 9, 2005 to January 5, 2007, Bulldog maintained an interactive Web site that provided information about its investment products. Any visitor to the Web site could view an opening home page, a "press room" containing links to various media articles, and a printable brochure that described the three hedge funds and gave a brief summary of each fund's approach to investment. For example, one of the hedge funds, Full Value Partners, L.P., was described in the brochure as "a fund that concentrates on taking substantial positions in undervalued operating companies and closed-end mutual funds [and] acts as a catalyst to 'unlock' these values through proprietary means." The brochure also stated that, "[s]ince its inception, Bulldog Investors has delivered a net average annual return significantly higher than that of the S&P [Standard & Poor's] 500 Index. Moreover, Bulldog has performed especially well in difficult investment periods like 2000 through 2002."   




        A visitor to the Web site could obtain additional information only by clicking the "I Agree" button to the following disclaimer on the opening screen:   




        "The information is available for information purposes only and does not constitute solicitation as to any investment service or product and is not an invitation to subscribe for shares or units in any fund herein. For the avoidance 


Page 651


of doubt this Web site may not be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful or not authorized. Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information herein, Bulldog Investors accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of information, nor the reasonableness of the conclusions based upon such information, which has been obtained from third parties. The pages referring specifically to investment products offered by Bulldog Investors are only available for view with a username and password, which can be obtained by contacting the company on the Registration Form provided. The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise. Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Changes in the rates of exchange may affect the value of investments."    




A follow-up screen invited the visitor to fill out a registration form that asked for the visitor's name, address, telephone and facsimile machine numbers, and an e-mail address. This registration page contained the same disclaimer as appeared on the opening screen of the Bulldog Web site, and the visitor was once again required to indicate agreement.




        On November 10, 2006, Brendan Hickey registered on the Bulldog Investors Web site by providing this information, including his Massachusetts address. Shortly after Hickey's registration, Steven Samuels, one of the managers of Bulldog Investors, sent an e-mail to Hickey that contained several attachments. Samuels's e-mail thanked Hickey for his interest in Bulldog and stated:   




        "While we are proud to have one of the best long term records in the business, it is very difficult to adequately describe what, why, and how we do what we do in a quick response to an email inquiry. . . . I have attached some basic information on our management including performance and philosophy. I would be more than happy to spend a few minutes on the phone if you wish to discuss in more detail. Please contact me at [telephone number provided]."    




The attachments to Samuels' e-mail included press articles, a 


Page 652


presentation about Bulldog's investment philosophy, managers, investment vehicles, and performance, and a letter to "Dear Partner" from two fund managers. The letter compared one hedge fund's returns to the S & P 500, described several of the fund's investments, and discussed successful litigation by fund managers against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The parties have stipulated that, but for the administrative proceeding and the sanctions imposed, Bulldog would provide other Massachusetts residents, including Bloness, with access to the same type of information that was available to Hickey through the Web site and e-mail communication.

        II. The Federal Securities Act of 1933. Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 act), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a et seq. (2006), to address the problems that were thought to have caused the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. See Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185, 194 (1976); Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Capital Gains Research Bur., Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 186-187 (1963). The overarching strategy of the 1933 act was to protect investors by requiring the disclosures that were necessary for informed decision-making. See Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124 (1953). See also Pinter v. Dahl, 486 U.S. 622, 638 (1988); Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, supra at 195; A.C. Frost & Co. v. Coeur D'Alene Mines Corp., 312 U.S. 38, 40 (1941). As acknowledged in its preamble, the 1933 act aimed to "provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce and through the mails." Pub. L. No. 73-22, 48 Stat. 74 (May 27, 1933), 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a et seq. In urging Congress to enact the legislation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained that, while the government should not be in the business of guaranteeing the soundness of any particular security, it had an obligation "to insist that every issue of new securities to be sold in interstate commerce shall be accompanied by full publicity and information, and that no essentially important element attending the issue shall be concealed from the buying public." Message from the President -- Regulation of Security Issues, presented to the Senate, 77 Cong. Rec. 937 (March 29, 1933).   




        Under the 1933 act, an issuer of securities may not "offer" 


Page 653


or sell a security unless the issuer has filed a registration statement as to that security with the SEC. [Note 6] 15 U.S.C. § 77e(c). The registration statement must provide detailed information about the security to be offered and the issuer's management and assets, including financial statements certified by an independent accountant. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77g, 77aa.   




        The 1933 act defines an "offer" broadly, encompassing "every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security or interest in a security, for value." 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(3). Pursuant to the 1933 act, therefore, offers "are not limited to communications which constitute an offer in the common law contract sense, or which on their face purport to offer a security. Rather, . . . they include 'any document which is designed to procure orders for a security.' " Matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., 38 S.E.C. 843, 848 (1959), quoting Security Act Release No. 2623 (July 25, 1941). See Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Cavanagh, 155 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir. 1998); Diskin v. Lomasney & Co., 452 F.2d 871, 875 (2d Cir. 1971). Determining whether a communication is an offer may involve "[d]ifficult and close questions of fact," and "depends upon all the facts, and the surrounding circumstances including the nature, source, distribution, timing, and apparent purpose and effect of the published material." Matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., supra at 853 & n.20. Because an offer includes "every . . . solicitation of an offer to buy," 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(3), the SEC has declared that the 1933 act "prohibits issuers . . . from initiating a public sales campaign prior to the filing of a registration statement by means of publicity efforts which, even though not couched in terms of an express offer, condition the public mind or arouse public interest in the particular securities." Matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., supra at 850.   




        The 1933 act, however, exempts certain securities and transactions from the registration requirement, including "transactions 


Page 654


by an issuer not involving any public offering," through what is known as the private offering exemption. See 15 U.S.C. § 77d(2). The meaning of this exemption has been developed through case law and SEC guidance. In Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Ralston Purina Co., supra at 124-125, the United States Supreme Court determined that the "natural way to interpret the private offering exemption is in light of the statutory purpose," and concluded that a private offering is an offer of securities to those who have no practical need for the registration statement because they have been "shown to be able to fend for themselves." In evaluating whether an offering is public or private, the courts and the SEC have considered the number of offerees, their access to information, the size or circumstances of the offering, the "sophistication" of the offerees in financial matters, and whether there is a preexisting relationship between the issuer and the offerees. See, e.g., Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Continental Tobacco Co. of S.C., 463 F.2d 137, 158 (5th Cir. 1972); Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Kenton Capital, Ltd., 69 F. Supp. 2d 1, 11 (D.D.C. 1998); Use of Electronic Media, SEC Release Nos. 33-7856, 34-42728, IC-24426, 65 Fed. Reg. 25,843, 25,852 (2000); 3 L. Loss, J. Seligman, & T. Parades, Securities Regulation 270-293 (4th ed. 2008). Because public advertising that is designed to procure orders for a security constitutes a public "offer" under the 1933 act, "[p]ublic advertising . . . would, of course, be incompatible with a claim of private offering." Non-Public Offering Exemption, SEC Release No. 33-4552, 27 Fed. Reg. 11,316, 11,316 (1962). See Hill York Corp. v. American Int'l Franchises, Inc., 448 F.2d 680, 689 (5th Cir. 1971).   




        To provide more certainty than the case law offers, the SEC promulgated regulation D, which provides a safe harbor for unregistered offerings that satisfy certain conditions. See 17 C.F.R. § 230.506 (2010). Among these, an issuer relying on regulation D may offer or sell only to "[a]ccredited investors" [Note 7] and to no more than thirty-five nonaccredited but sophisticated 


Page 655


investors who have "such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that [they are] capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment." 17 C.F.R. §§ 230.501(e), 230.506(b)(2) (2010). The regulations further provide that an issuer relying on regulation D may not "offer or sell the securities by any form of general solicitation or general advertising." 17 C.F.R. §§ 230.502(c), 230.506(b)(1) (2010). Applying these principles in the context of Internet Web sites, the SEC has concluded that the use of a Web site to offer or sell unregistered securities constitutes a "general solicitation" that disqualifies the offering as "private" unless the solicitation is contained in a password-restricted Web page that becomes available to a prospective investor who has been reasonably determined to be "accredited" or "sophisticated" within the meaning of regulation D. See Use of Electronic Media, SEC Release Nos. 33-7856, 34-42728, IC-24426, supra at 25,851-25,852; Lamp Techs., Inc., SEC No-Action Letter, 1997 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 638, at 


Page 5


-6 (May 29, 1997) (placement of private offering materials on Web site inconsistent with prohibition against general advertising, unless procedures limit access to accredited investors).   




        III. The Massachusetts act. Massachusetts has adopted the Uniform Securities Act, which largely tracks the requirements of Federal securities law. See St. 1972, c. 694, § 1. See also G. L. c. 110A, § 415 (Massachusetts act "shall be so construed as to effectuate its general purpose . . . to coordinate the interpretation and administration of this [act] with the related federal regulation"). The Massachusetts act prohibits the offer or sale of securities in the Commonwealth unless the securities are registered, the security or transaction is exempt, or the security is a Federal covered security, that is, a security exempt from State regulation by imposition of Federal law. G. L. c. 110A, § 301. See 15 U.S.C. § 77r; G. L. c. 110A, § 306. As under the 1933 act, an "offer" is not limited to the common-law definition of the term, see Bulldog I, supra at 220, but is defined to include "every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation of an offer to buy, a security or interest in a security for value." G. L. c. 110A, § 401 (i) (2).   




        Massachusetts permits several exemptions from its registration 


Page 656


requirement; some we mention here. See G. L. c. 110A, § 402. First, as required by Federal law, see 15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(4)(D), Massachusetts exempts any securities transaction that falls within the safe harbor of rule 506 of the SEC's regulation D, which requires compliance with the prohibition against general advertising in rule 502(c) of regulation D. See 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(13)(l) (2000). A second exemption applies to certain transactions that follow an offer directed at no more than twenty-five people other than broker-dealers or banks and other financial institutions. G. L. c. 110A, § 402 (b) (9). Like regulation D, this exemption is not available if the issuer or anyone on the issuer's behalf "offers or sells the securities by any form of general advertising." 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(9)(e) (2000). Massachusetts also exempts an offer of securities from registration in Massachusetts where the offer is communicated through the Internet, is not directed specifically to any investors in the Commonwealth, and no unregistered, nonexempt sales are made in the Commonwealth. 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(13)(m) (2000). [Note 8]   




        IV. Discussion. The plaintiffs argue that Massachusetts securities laws that prevent Bulldog from offering securities through general advertisements are overbroad and violate the First Amendment, applied to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They specifically challenge the constitutionality of the regulations that prohibit general solicitation and advertising by anyone offering unregistered securities. See 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(9)(e), § 14.402(B)(13)(l); 17 C.F.R. § 230.502(c). Because 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(13)(l) incorporates the prohibition against general solicitation and advertising of unregistered securities in rule 502(c) of the SEC's regulation D, the plaintiffs' claims implicitly challenge 


Page 657


the constitutionality of this provision of Federal regulation. In short, the plaintiffs contend that the injunctive relief and administrative sanctions issued against them must be vacated because they are constitutionally entitled to maintain their Web site and communicate with any interested person, such as Bloness. We first consider whether the challenged provisions of Massachusetts securities law are constitutionally valid as applied to the communications at issue in this case, and, if having determined that they are valid, proceed to the overbreadth challenge. Trustees of the State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 484-485 (1989) (Fox).   




        1. First Amendment protection. The Secretary argues that we need not consider the First Amendment questions because an issuer's statements about its securities do not implicate the First Amendment. However, we find no basis for any exception to the First Amendment for speech that is restricted as part of the regulation of securities. We recognize that "the State does not lose its power to regulate commercial activity . . . whenever speech is a component of that activity," and note that the Supreme Court has stated in dicta that "the exchange of information about securities" is speech that is "regulated without offending the First Amendment" because it is a means of carrying out such commercial activity. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978). But we do not equate the communications at issue here with commercial conduct of which speech is merely an incidental part. In Bulldog I, supra, we concluded that, viewed together, the e-mail to Hickey and the presentation, press articles, letter, and other materials that were attached to the e-mail constituted an offer of securities because they "were designed to stimulate interest in Bulldog's funds." The documents that comprised this offer are forms of expression akin to the advertising materials addressed in numerous First Amendment cases involving commercial speech. See, e.g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 620, 623 (1995) (direct-mail solicitations); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 67 (1983) (informational pamphlets). Because such commercial advertising implicates the First Amendment, see Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 763-765 (1976) (Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy), we conclude that Bulldog's communications concerning its 


Page 658


financial products, management, and investment philosophy are speech protected by the First Amendment.   




        2. The nature of the speech at issue. Having determined that the communications at issue are protected under the First Amendment, we next must determine "whether the principal type of expression at issue is commercial speech." Fox, supra at 473. This determination is of consequence because commercial speech has been said to occupy a "subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values," where "modes of regulation [are allowed] that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression." Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, supra. Commercial speech is afforded less protection because it is " 'linked inextricably' with the commercial arrangement that it proposes," such that "the State's interest in regulating the underlying transaction may give it a concomitant interest in the expression itself." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 767 (1993), quoting Friedman v. Rogers, 440 U.S. 1, 10 n.9 (1979). See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 499 (1996) (plurality opinion). [Note 9]   




        But commercial speech is still afforded significant constitutional protection because of its importance to consumers and society as a whole. See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra. Commercial speech "assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible dissemination of information," Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 561-562 (1980) (Central Hudson), and serves an important "public interest" in ensuring that decisions about the allocation of resources in a free enterprise economy are "intelligent and well informed." Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 765. See also Central Hudson, supra at 567 (protecting information available for consumers is "purpose of the First Amendment"); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, supra at 454 (First Amendment safeguards "society's interest . . . in assuring the free flow of commercial information"). As such, the protection received by commercial speech is "qualified but 


Page 659


nonetheless substantial." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., supra at 68.   




        Commercial speech is most commonly defined as that which "propose[s] a commercial transaction." Fox, supra at 473, quoting Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 762. See, e.g., Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1339 (2010) (Milavetz) (advertising by debt relief agencies); Thompson v. Western States Med. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357, 366 (2002) (Thompson) (advertising and solicitation of prescriptions for "compounded drugs"); Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 184 (1999) (broadcasting casino advertising); Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., supra (attorney direct-mail solicitations); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 481 (1995) (publication of alcohol content on beer labels); Ibanez v. Florida Dep't of Business & Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U.S. 136, 138, 142 (1994) (attorney's publication of professional certifications in "Yellow Pages" listings and on business cards and other materials). While it is difficult to delineate precisely the range of expression that falls into the commercial speech category, see Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 419 (1993), speech "advertising the price of a product or arguing its merits" is a "typical" example of commercial speech. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Bldg. & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 576 (1988).   




        Some commercial speech may be so "inextricably intertwined" with noncommercial speech as to lose its commercial character, where "the nature of the speech taken as a whole" is noncommercial. See Riley v. National Fed'n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796 (1988). But the mere presence of noncommercial speech in commercial materials does not alter the commercial character of the surrounding communications. See Fox, supra at 473-474 ("Tupperware parties" were commercial speech even though they included discussion of financial responsibility and home economics, where "[n]o law of man or of nature makes it impossible to sell housewares without teaching home economics, or to teach home economics without selling housewares"). Communications may thus be categorized as commercial speech "notwithstanding the fact that they contain discussions of important public issues." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 


Page 660


supra at 67-68 (condom manufacturer's pamphlet discussing venereal disease and also promoting specific products was commercial speech). See Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 637-638 & n.7 (1985) (Zauderer) (attorney's advertisement offering representation and giving information about legal rights to women alleging injury caused by particular intrauterine device was commercial speech). Because "[a] company has the full panoply of protections available to its direct comments on public issues . . . there is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions." Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., supra at 68.   




        Here, having already concluded that the communications at issue were "designed to stimulate interest in Bulldog's funds," and "constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities," Bulldog I, supra at 220, we think it plain that "the principal type of expression at issue is commercial speech." Fox, supra at 473. Accordingly, we proceed to consider whether the challenged provisions of Massachusetts securities law are permissible regulations of commercial speech.   




        3. The two standards of review for commercial speech. The United States Supreme Court has articulated two distinct standards of review that are applicable in commercial speech cases. Where the government prohibits a category of commercial speech, the Supreme Court applies an intermediate scrutiny test articulated in Central Hudson, supra at 566, requiring that restrictions "be tailored in a reasonable manner to serve a substantial state interest." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 767 (1993) (striking down ban on in-person solicitation by certified public accountants). See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2667-2668 (2011) (State must show "statute directly advances a substantial governmental interest and that the measure is drawn to achieve that interest"). However, where the government requires the disclosure of commercial information, the Court applies a more generous test, upholding disclosure requirements that are "reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers." Zauderer, supra at 650, 651 (recognizing 


Page 661


"material differences between disclosure requirements and outright prohibitions on speech"). [Note 10]   




        In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 770, the case in which commercial speech was first held to be protected by the First Amendment, the Court held unconstitutional a State statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising the price of any prescription drug. The Court recognized that the State's justification for the advertising ban -- the fear that price competition would diminish the professionalism of pharmacists and the quality of the services they provide -- "rests in large measure on the advantages of [citizens] being kept in ignorance." Id. at 769. The Court noted that the "alternative to this highly paternalistic approach . . . is to assume that this information is not in itself harmful, that people will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and that the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication rather than to close them." Id. at 770. Recognizing that the public interest is served where private economic decisions are "intelligent and well informed," the Court concluded that "[i]t is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the First Amendment makes for us." Id. at 765, 770.   




        Since then, the Supreme Court has consistently articulated two key principles in the commercial speech cases: it views "as dubious any justification that is based on the benefits of public ignorance," and it has prescribed that the "preferred remedy" for the risk to the public of inaccurate or incomplete information "is more disclosure, rather than less." Bates v. State Bar of 


Page 662


Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 375 (1977). See Thompson, supra at 374 ("We have previously rejected the notion that the Government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information").   




        Applying these principles, where the government has suppressed commercial speech and where its suppression has diminished consumers' ability to make informed and reliable decisions regarding lawful purchases, the Supreme Court has applied the intermediate scrutiny of the Central Hudson test (or, before Central Hudson, a variant of the test), and, with few exceptions, struck down laws suppressing commercial speech. See, e.g., Thompson, supra (striking down provisions of Federal statute that prohibited pharmacists from advertising compounded drugs); Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525 (2001) (striking down restrictions on outdoor and in-store advertising of cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and cigars); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484 (1996) (striking down State statute prohibiting retail price advertising of alcoholic beverages); Central Hudson, supra (striking down ban on advertising by electric utilities that promoted use of electricity); Linmark Assocs., Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85 (1977) (striking down town ordinance prohibiting posting of "for sale" signs on homes in order to stem flight of white home owners from integrated community). [Note 11] Consistent with the disfavor that these cases demonstrate for laws that suppress information in an attempt to 


Page 663


influence consumer choice, the Supreme Court recently struck down a State statute that burdened speech in order to "tilt public debate in a preferred direction" and discourage demand for a particular disfavored product (in this case, higher priced brand-name drugs). See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., supra at 2670-2671. [Note 12]   




        By contrast, where a government has required particular commercial disclosures, the Supreme Court has recognized that laws that compel disclosure are consistent with the core principles that underlie the commercial speech doctrine because they are designed to diminish public ignorance and make accurate and complete information available. See Zauderer, supra at 651. Where an advertiser is required to disclose "purely factual and uncontroversial information," the advertiser's rights "are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers." Id. See Milavetz, supra at 1339-1340 (applying Zauderer reasonable relation test to requirement that agencies providing debt relief services disclose that debt relief may involve bankruptcy relief). In addition, "because disclosure requirements trench much more narrowly on an advertiser's interests than do flat prohibitions on speech," Zauderer, supra at 651, the Court has repeatedly stated in commercial speech cases that a disclosure requirement is a less burdensome and more appropriate alternative. See Thompson, supra at 376; Central Hudson, supra at 570-571; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 


Page 664


771-772 n.24. See also Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 130 S. Ct. 876, 914-915 (2010) (upholding disclosure requirements in context of "electioneering communications," noting "disclosure is a less restrictive alternative to more comprehensive regulations of speech").   




        4. Application of Zauderer reasonable relation test. Because securities regulation since 1933 has been designed to ensure the availability of adequate information about securities through the requirement of thorough disclosures, we analyze whether the challenged provisions satisfy the Zauderer reasonable relation test. In considering the applicability of this test, we note first that a disclosure requirement typically incorporates a prohibition on commercial speech (or conduct), because the commercial speaker is generally barred from advertising or engaging in particular conduct unless the speaker makes the disclosure. See, e.g., Milavetz, supra at 1330 (requirement that debt relief agencies make required disclosure in advertisements operates as ban on advertising unless disclosure is made); Zauderer, supra at 633 (requirement that attorneys advertising contingent fee arrangements make required disclosures operates as ban on advertising contingent fee representation without disclosures). Thus, the existence of a conditional prohibition on commercial speech, which the speaker may avoid by making the disclosure, does not itself subject the disclosure requirement to the Central Hudson test. See Zauderer, supra at 651. Rather, a typical disclosure requirement incorporates a ban on speech (or conduct) that defines and enforces the disclosure rule.   




        The fundamental principle woven into Massachusetts securities laws, as well as the 1933 act and its accompanying regulations, is complete and accurate disclosure in the sale of securities. This is not only clear from the purpose and history of the 1933 act, described in its preamble as an act to "provide full and fair disclosure," Pub. L. No. 73-22, 48 Stat. 74 (May 27, 1933), but is apparent from the plain language of the Federal and State provisions at issue in this case. By requiring the filing of a registration statement before a public offering can be made, the Massachusetts act ensures that potential buyers are provided with detailed information about the securities being offered and the entities offering them, including financial statements that 


Page 665


have been certified by an independent accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. See G. L. c. 110A, §§ 301-303; 950 Code Mass. Regs. §§ 14.401, 14.412 (C) (2000). The prohibition against public offerings that Bulldog challenges as a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech is simply the means to enforce the disclosure requirements for a public offering, specifically the filing of a registration statement. While a registration statement is not required for a private offering of securities, a private offering, as the name suggests, is a limited exemption from the general registration requirement, permitting offers to accredited and sophisticated investors who, precisely because they are accredited and sophisticated, are deemed able to fend for themselves. See Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 122 & n.5, 124-125 (1953).   




        Neither the Federal nor the State government has prevented Bulldog from making information about its securities available to the general public, because nothing prevents Bulldog from filing a registration statement, with all its required disclosures, and advertising its securities to the general public. This is not a case in which the government seeks to "keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good." 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 503 (1996) (plurality opinion). See Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 769. Rather, the prohibition on speech at issue in this case is incorporated into a disclosure regime that is designed to encourage, not suppress, full and fair disclosure.   




        Bulldog argues that the Supreme Court's application of the Central Hudson test in Thompson, supra at 367, demonstrates that this case should also be analyzed as a prohibition on speech where that test is applied. Thompson, supra at 360- 361, 364-365, involved three provisions of Federal law: a requirement that all new drugs submit to Federal new drug approval procedures, an exemption to these approval procedures for "compounded drugs" (created when a pharmacist combines or alters ingredients, such as to generate a medication tailored to a particular patient's needs), and a ban on advertising of compounded drugs that had not been approved through the new drug approval procedures. Bulldog argues that its decision not 


Page 666


to file a registration statement is analogous to a compounder's decision not to seek Federal new drug approval, and that the ban on general solicitation should be reviewed under the Central Hudson test, as was the advertising ban in the Thompson case. However, none of the parties in Thompson challenged the appropriateness of applying the Central Hudson test, and the Court did not discuss how or under what circumstances a different test might be applicable. Thompson, supra at 367. This is probably because it was undisputed in Thompson that approval was too costly to be practicable for a small scale compounded drug designed for the needs of an individual patient, so that requiring Federal approval of all drug products compounded by pharmacies would effectively eliminate the practice of compounding. Id. at 369.   




        The ban on advertising at issue in Thompson, while theoretically conditional, was not designed to enforce a disclosure requirement imposed on drugs that obtain Federal approval. Rather, the ban was enacted to prevent compounders from successfully marketing new drugs on a large scale without undergoing the Federal new drug approval process, a purpose that the Court found could be served by directly regulating compounded drug production rather than regulating speech. Id. at 370-372. Thompson, supra, thus involved the type of speech ban that is typically analyzed under the Central Hudson test because it limits the information available to the public about lawful purchases and "threatens societal interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that First Amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to safeguard." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 766 (1993), and cases cited.   




        Bulldog further argues that, even if the prohibition on general solicitation is incidental to a disclosure scheme, the standard articulated in Zauderer, supra at 651, is not applicable because that case asks whether a disclosure requirement is "reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers," and no deception is alleged in this case; instead, the parties stipulated that the information on Bulldog's Web site and in its direct e-mail communication with Hickey was not misleading. We recognize that the disclosures required in Milavetz and Zauderer were intended to combat inherently misleading advertisements, 


Page 667


but we do not agree that the more deferential review for required commercial disclosures applies only to disclosures designed to prevent deception and not to disclosures designed to ensure that consumers have full and fair information. Both Milavetz and Zauderer treat disclosures differently from restrictions on speech because of the commercial speaker's "minimal" constitutionally protected interest in not providing "factual and uncontroversial information," and because disclosure rules serve the social interest in increasing the information available to the public, an interest that undergirds the protection of commercial speech in the first place. Zauderer, supra. See Milavetz, supra at 1339; Central Hudson, supra at 567; Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 764-765. [Note 13] Because Milavetz and Zauderer do not expressly limit the reasonable relation test to the particular State interest in preventing consumer deception, and the rationales on which they rely are equally applicable to the State interest asserted here of ensuring full and accurate information to securities investors, we conclude that the appropriate First Amendment test in this case is the reasonable relation test in Zauderer, supra, not the Central Hudson test. [Note 14] Accord New York State Restaurant Ass'n v. New York City Bd. of Health, 556 F.3d 114, 132-133 (2d Cir. 2009) (requirement that chain restaurants post calorie information analyzed pursuant to Zauderer test although State not acting to prevent consumer deception); Pharmaceutical Care Mgt. Ass'n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 310 n.8 (1st Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 547 U.S. 1179 (2006) ("we have found no 


Page 668


cases limiting Zauderer" to State interest in preventing consumer deception). See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501 (1996) (plurality opinion) ("When a State regulates commercial messages to protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the purpose of its regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review" [emphasis added]).   




        Applying the Zauderer reasonable relation test, we conclude that the disclosure requirement at issue here, a registration statement that must be in effect prior to a public offering of securities, is reasonably related to the State's interest in promoting the integrity of capital markets by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information. Where the issuer has chosen not to file a registration statement and make the required disclosures, the incidental ban on general solicitation of unregistered securities is reasonably related to the same State interest.   




        5. Application of Central Hudson test. Even if we were to view the challenged regulations at issue as prohibitions on commercial speech, rather than as part of a broader disclosure requirement, we conclude that they withstand constitutional scrutiny under the Central Hudson test. In Central Hudson, supra at 566, the Court established a four-pronged test to determine the constitutionality of restrictions on commercial speech:   




        "At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest."    




See Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 554 (2001); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 482 (1995). The government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of 


Page 669


its regulation under this test. See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp., 463 U.S. 60, 71 n.20 (1983). [Note 15]




        Here, the first and second prongs are not at issue, because the parties have stipulated that the speech in this case concerns lawful activity and is not misleading, and that the Commonwealth has a substantial State interest in protecting the integrity of capital markets, and thereby preserving the over-all health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information. Thus, we need only determine whether the third and fourth prongs of Central Hudson are satisfied, that is, whether the challenged regulations "directly advance" the substantial government interest and are "not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest." Id. at 564, 566.   




        Under the third prong of Central Hudson, we must determine "whether the speech restriction directly and materially advances the asserted governmental interest." Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 188 (1999). "This burden is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture; rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 770-771 (1993). See Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, supra. Accordingly, a restriction on commercial speech 


Page 670


will not be upheld "if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose." Central Hudson, supra at 564.   




        Bulldog asks us to construe this direct advancement prong of Central Hudson as a requirement that the connection between the regulation of speech and the State's interest not depend on intermediate steps. This reading, however, is unsupported by the Supreme Court's commercial speech jurisprudence, which has emphasized the reliability and effectiveness with which a regulatory mechanism advances the State's goal, rather than the presence or absence of intermediate steps. In Central Hudson, supra at 569, the Court found that a regulation that prohibited an electric utility from promoting the use of electricity in advertisements had a "direct link" to the State interest in energy conservation and satisfied the third prong of the test, although it is clear that the effect of the regulation on the State interest depended on the choices of consumers. See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 625, 628 (1995); United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 428 (1993). Similarly, where the Supreme Court has found the third prong of the Central Hudson test not to be satisfied, it has not highlighted the presence of intermediate causal steps, but rather has emphasized the ineffectiveness of the regulation at serving the State's objective. See, e.g., Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2669-2671 (2011) (law limiting use of prescriber information in connection with marketing efforts, but allowing "extensive use of prescriber-identifying information" in other contexts, did not advance interest of protecting prescriber privacy, lowering costs of medical care, or promoting public health); Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, supra at 193, quoting Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra at 489 (finding " 'little chance' that the speech restriction could have directly and materially advanced its aim, 'while other provisions of the same Act directly undermine[d] and counteract[ed] its effects' ").   




        In this case, the Secretary offered in evidence the report and testimony of Franco, an expert witness who teaches and writes about securities regulation and who served as assistant general counsel in the SEC's office of general counsel. [Note 16] Finding 


Page 671


Franco's opinions to be "well-founded and highly credible," the trial judge adopted them in substance. On the issue of effectiveness, the judge found:   




  "The public filing of a registration statement, conforming in both form and content to uniform regulatory requirements, serves to provide complete, balanced, and accurate information not only to those who might consider investing in a particular offering, but also to the public as a whole, including regulatory officials, private analysts, large investors, and the news media, whose review serves as a powerful check on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided. That process tends to result in market prices that accurately reflect value, for the benefit of all investors, both those purchasing the particular issue and those trading in other securities. The ban on general advertising of unregistered securities . . . provides a powerful incentive for issuers to register, despite the substantial costs of doing so, thereby maximizing the benefits of the registration system to the public as a whole; . . . it is vital to the effectiveness of the registration system."   




        We adopt these findings and agree that the public filing of a registration statement provides the best assurance that investors in publicly offered securities will make decisions based on full and accurate information. We also consider compelling the expert's conclusion that the registration system's ability to promote well-informed markets would be compromised if unregistered securities could be widely advertised using incomplete information selected by the issuer. Therefore, we conclude that the prohibition against publicly advertising an offer to sell unregistered securities about which the required disclosures have not been made available effectively, directly, and materially advances the State's interest in preserving the integrity of capital markets by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full 


Page 672


and accurate information. See Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, supra at 188. [Note 17]   




        The fourth prong of Central Hudson, supra at 566, asks whether a challenged regulation is "more extensive than is necessary" to serve the asserted government interest. In Fox, supra at 480, the Supreme Court clarified that this prong does not require the regulatory scheme to be the least restrictive means of achieving the government's objective; rather, it analyzes the "fit" between governmental objectives and the regulatory means chosen, and requires that fit to be "not necessarily perfect, but reasonable." See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., supra at 2668, quoting Fox, supra at 480 (regulation must be "drawn to achieve" the State interest and requires "fit between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends"); Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 561 (2001) (fourth prong "requires a reasonable fit between the means and ends of the regulatory scheme"). The fourth prong of Central Hudson is, therefore, an inquiry into whether the scope of the restriction on speech is in proportion to the interest served by the restriction. See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., supra; Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, supra; Fox, supra. Although the costs to free speech must be "carefully calculated," governments have "leeway" to "judge what manner of regulation may best be employed." Id. at 480, 481. [Note 18]   




        In this case, Bulldog has offered eleven alternative measures 


Page 673


that they suggest would serve the asserted State interest with less restriction on speech, and the parties have stipulated that these are the only alternative means that are at issue in this litigation. These alternatives propose to shift regulation from the offer stage to the point of sale by preserving the restrictions on the sale of unregistered securities while permitting solicitation of offers from the general public. Instead of regulating offers, the alternatives would provide additional regulation at the point of sale, such as extra reporting requirements, additional controls on the accreditation of investors, a waiting period before transactions became final, or authorization to the Secretary to rescind transactions that fail to comply with applicable law. [Note 19]   




        The judge, relying on Franco's expert opinion, found that these alternatives "would decrease the protection of investors and impair market integrity." The judge declared:   




  "[A]ll of the plaintiffs' proposals would reduce the incentive to register, and encourage issuers to make unregistered offerings, sacrificing lawful access to some potential buyers in favor of saving the costs of registration. . . . [A]ll of the proposals would likely result in increased 'distortive' (that is, unbalanced) communications, increased incidence of unlawful transactions (such as sales to unaccredited investors), and proliferation of scams. Those proposals that rely on increased enforcement activity in connection with sales would suffer from the problem of coming after, rather than before transactions, when dissipation of assets may prevent effective remedies."   


Page 674


        We agree. The proposed alternatives will certainly decrease the quality of, and will likely decrease the quantity of, information in the marketplace, will increase the likelihood of securities scams and of unlawful sales of unregistered securities to unsophisticated investors, and will weaken the market's efficiency overall. Bulldog's proposal to concentrate enforcement at the point of sale rather than at the offer stage increases the risk that enforcement will come too late to prevent the harm or permit monetary recovery. We note that State securities regulation before 1933 largely focused on the regulation of transactions at the point of sale, and that the failure of this patchwork of State laws to achieve their regulatory aims demonstrated the need for the Federal 1933 act. Keller, Introductory Comment: A Historical Introduction to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: Symposium on Current Issues in Securities Regulation, 49 Ohio St. L.J. 329, 331, 336 (1988). The framers of the 1933 act contemplated the drawbacks of after-the-fact enforcement and determined that these measures "lock[] the door after the horse is gone" and prevent regulators from effectively protecting investors from economic harm. Hon. Huston Thompson, Federal Securities Act Hearings before the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., on H.R. 4314, at 102 (1933), quoting statement of Hon. Clarence F. Lee, of California, Hearings before Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.R. 7215, 67th Cong., 1st Sess.   




        In concluding that the challenged restriction on the public advertising of unregistered securities represents a reasonable fit between the regulatory ends and the means chosen, we recognize that this restriction is not a "blanket ban" on speech, Central Hudson, supra at 566 n.9, that can be considered in isolation, but an integral part of a broader regulatory scheme that mandates public disclosures and permits limited exemptions for private offerings directed at those investors who can be relied on adequately to inform themselves. See Thompson, supra at 376 (recognizing disclosure as "far less restrictive alternative" to a restriction on commercial speech). We also recognize that, if we were to declare the restriction unconstitutional in the name of freedom of speech, the foreseeable consequence would be less 


Page 675


speech, not more. See Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, 130 S. Ct. 876, 911 (2010) ("it is our law and our tradition that more speech, not less, is the governing rule"); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U.S. 476, 497 (1995) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment) ("more speech and a better informed citizenry are among the central goals of the Free Speech Clause"). In addition, we consider that the burden on First Amendment rights is diminished in this case because alternative channels of communication are available to Bulldog through the registration system and through the exemptions that permit communication with a limited group of investors. See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 634 (1995) ("Finding no basis to question the commonsense conclusion that the many alternative channels for communicating necessary information about attorneys are sufficient, we see no defect in Florida's regulation"). By providing exemptions for private offerings, designed to lessen the burdens of securities laws when the protections of the regulatory system are not needed, see Securities & Exch. Comm'n v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 122 & n.5, 124-125 (1953), the Secretary has "carefully calculated" the benefits and burdens of securities regulation, Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 417 (1993), rather than proceed by "wholesale suppression of truthful, nonmisleading information." 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 505 (1996) (plurality opinion). See Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 562 (2001).   




        Finally, we recognize that a measure of judicial restraint is appropriate where a court is asked to intrude on a system of securities regulation that has served the nation and this Commonwealth well since 1933, and to cut a stitch in the patchwork of regulatory enforcement that risks its unraveling and predictably will diminish its effectiveness. If any reminder was needed, the financial collapse in the autumn of 2008 that led to our persistent recession illustrates the extent to which unregulated and poorly regulated securities have the potential to become "financial weapons of mass destruction." The Great Derivatives Smackdown, Forbes, May 9, 2003, quoting Warren Buffett's Annual Letter to Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (March 8, 2003).   


Page 676


        In light of these considerations and the judge's findings, supported by credible expert testimony, that none of the proposed alternatives would adequately achieve the State interest, we are persuaded that the Secretary has found a fit between its regulatory means and its goal of promoting full and accurate information in the sale of securities "that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable." United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 429 (1993). We, therefore, conclude that the Secretary has met his burden of satisfying the Central Hudson test.   




        6. The overbreadth doctrine. Having found that the speech at issue in this case is commercial, and that the challenged provisions of Massachusetts securities law constitutionally regulate that speech, we now consider Bulldog's claim that the regulations should nonetheless be found unconstitutional because they also restrict fully protected, noncommercial speech in violation of the First Amendment. The overbreadth doctrine allows an individual whose speech may be constitutionally regulated to argue that a law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the speech of others. See Fox, supra at 482-483. See also United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 1591-1592 (2010). Overbreadth has thus been described as an exception to the general principle that litigants only have standing to assert their own rights and not the rights of others; in the free speech context, such challenges have been permitted in order "to prevent [a] statute from chilling the First Amendment rights of other parties not before the court." Secretary of State of Md. v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 957, 958 (1984). See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 445 n.5 (1972). [Note 20] Despite the doctrine's origin as an exception to standing requirements, overbreadth challenges can also be brought, as here, where a law's application to the "principal type of expression at issue" in the case is constitutional, but the plaintiffs argue that their own First Amendment rights will be violated by other applications of the same law. Fox, supra at 473, 484.   




        The Supreme Court has recognized the overbreadth doctrine 


Page 677


as "strong medicine" and has limited its application to instances where a law "prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech." United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292, 293 (2008), quoting Los Angeles Police Dep't v. United Reporting Publ. Corp., 528 U.S. 32, 39 (1999). Substantial overbreadth demands a "realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court." City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 800-802 (1984) (declining to entertain overbreadth claim where such danger not shown). Further, the overbreadth must be "substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep." United States v. Williams, supra at 292.   




        The overbreadth doctrine is not applied in commercial speech cases because the concern that speech will be chilled is much weaker in the case of a commercial speaker. See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 380-381 (1977) ("Since advertising is linked to commercial well-being, it seems unlikely that such speech is particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation"). See also Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 670 (1994) (plurality opinion); Fox, supra at 481. However, this limitation is only relevant in cases where the speech restricted by the overbroad application is itself commercial speech; an overbreadth challenge may be raised by a commercial speaker claiming, as here, that a regulation unconstitutionally restricts noncommercial speech. Id.   




        We turn, therefore, to the question whether the relevant provisions of Massachusetts securities law reach a "substantial amount" of noncommercial speech. United States v. Williams, supra. Bulldog alleges, for example, that they are prevented from communicating about their unregistered securities "with anyone, including journalists, students, academics and others," even though these individuals are not interested in buying or selling securities. However, under the challenged provisions of Massachusetts securities law, an issuer's speech is restricted only where it is designed to solicit an offer to purchase securities. See G. L. c. 110A, §§ 301, 401 (i) (2). See also Matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., 38 SEC 843, 853 (1959) (allowing for "flow of normal corporate news, unrelated to a selling effort 


Page 678


for an issue of securities"); Interpretive Release on Regulation D, SEC Release No. 33-6455, 48 Fed. Reg. 10,045, 10,052 (1983) (if communication not "being used by the issuer or by someone on the issuer's behalf to offer or sell the securities . . . then the issuer will not be in violation of Rule 502[c]"); G.F. Gerstenfeld, SEC No-Action Letter, 1985 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 2790, * 2 (Dec. 3, 1985) ("relevant question . . . is whether publication of the advertisement constitutes an offer to sell securities"); Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, Inc., SEC No-Action Letter, 1985 SEC No-Act. LEXIS 2918, *1 (Dec. 3, 1985) (limited mailing of solicitation "generic in nature" and not making reference to any specific investment not an offer); G. L. c. 110A, § 415 (interpretation of Massachusetts act should be coordinated with related Federal law).   




        Bulldog can raise an overbreadth challenge, therefore, only if a substantial amount of speech included within the term "offer," is outside that which is categorized as commercial speech. [Note 21] While "the precise bounds of the category of expression that may be termed commercial speech" are uncertain, Zauderer, supra at 637, the definition of an offer in securities law as a communication "designed to procure orders for a security," Matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., supra at 848, Securities Act Release No. 2623 (July 25, 1941), is close to the common definition of commercial speech as that which "propose[s] a commercial transaction." Fox, supra at 473-474, quoting Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 762. Although the outer limits of the two terms may not be identical, we conclude that the category of "offers" regulated by the Secretary and the SEC does not include a substantial amount of noncommercial speech relative to the plainly legitimate sweep of the statute and regulations. See United States v. Williams, supra. As a result, Bulldog's overbreadth challenge fails.   




        7. Bloness's right to listen. Bloness alleges that his First Amendment rights are independently violated by the Secretary's 


Page 679


enforcement of securities laws and regulations that prevent him from receiving information that Bulldog would otherwise make available, unless he first identifies himself and demonstrates he is an accredited or sophisticated investor. [Note 22] We agree with Bloness that the interests of consumers in receiving commercial information, and the interests of society in the free flow of such information, have been the foundation of commercial speech doctrine from its inception. See Central Hudson, supra at 567 ("suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions and thereby defeats the purpose of the First Amendment"); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 763 ("As to the particular consumer's interest in the free flow of commercial information, that interest may be as keen, if not keener by far, than his interest in the day's most urgent political debate"). See also Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 571 (2001) ("The First Amendment . . . constrains state efforts to limit advertising of tobacco products, because so long as the sale and use of tobacco is lawful for adults, the tobacco industry has a protected interest in communicating information about its products and adult customers have an interest in receiving that information").   




        We also agree that the Supreme Court has in certain cases recognized the rights of listeners regardless whether the rights of the speakers were protected. See Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 764 (1972) (First Amendment rights of listeners implicated where Federal government denied visa to foreign lecturer because of his advocacy of communism); Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., 381 U.S. 301, 305 (1965) (First Amendment rights of recipient violated by postal service requirement that "communist political propaganda" originating in foreign country be delivered only if addressee filled out reply card indicating desire to receive such mail). See also Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 564 (1969) ( "It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas"). And we agree that, in certain circumstances, a listener's First Amendment rights may be infringed if he is required affirmatively to declare a desire to receive controversial communications, 


Page 680


where the requirement may deter him from requesting these communications because of the risk to reputation, employment, or prospects for future employment. See Lamont v. Postmaster Gen., supra at 307. See also Denver Area Educ. Telecomm. Consortium, Inc. v. FCC, 518 U.S. 727, 753-755 (1996) (striking down Federal requirement that "patently offensive" cable television programming be blocked and made available on separate channel only to subscribers who requested in writing to view the offensive content). But nothing in the cases Bloness cites requires independent consideration of his claim in this case, where we have already concluded that the government has permissibly regulated the communications of a commercial speaker. The consequence of recognizing the First Amendment rights of listeners is to give standing to listeners to assert that free speech has been unconstitutionally infringed, not to grant listeners a different standard of review or a greater right to listen to commercial speech than a speaker has to say it. See Fox, supra at 472-473, 475, 485-486 (Central Hudson was applicable standard where State university students claimed that violation of their First Amendment rights resulted from university's restriction of outside commercial speakers); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 757 ("If there is a right to advertise, there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising, and it may be asserted by [consumers]"); Spargo v. New York State Comm'n on Judicial Conduct, 351 F.3d 65, 83 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 1085 (2004) (listeners "may claim no greater First Amendment protection" than speaker); National Ass'n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Jones, 131 F.3d 1317, 1322 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 813 (1998) ("no precedent exists for the proposition that the listener's rights are greater than those of the speaker"). Where, as here, a State permissibly regulates commercial speech in a manner consistent with the First Amendment, its regulation will be upheld, regardless whether the challenge is brought by a speaker or by a would-be listener. See Fox, supra. See also American Future Sys., Inc. v. Pennsylvania State Univ., 752 F.2d 854, 862 (3d Cir. 1984), cert. denied sub nom. Johnson v. Pennsylvania State Univ., 473 U.S. 911 (1985) ("the essential nature of the speech remains unchanged regardless of whose rights are being adjudicated, 


Page 681


and the same test should be used whether it is the speaker's or the listeners' rights that are at stake"). Having found that Bulldog's First Amendment rights were not violated by the Secretary's enforcement of Massachusetts securities laws, we need undergo no further analysis to conclude that the rights of Bloness to receive information were not violated.   




        V. Conclusion. The Supreme Court has on numerous occasions suggested that Federal and State securities laws do not run afoul of the First Amendment. [Note 23] Although these statements have been dicta, they have also been consistent with the Court's recognition of a State's lawful ability to ensure that "the stream of commercial information flow[s] cleanly as well as freely." Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 772. By encouraging the submission of comprehensive registration statements and allowing those who choose not to file them to advertise their securities to accredited and sophisticated investors but not to the public as a whole, the Secretary does not "threaten[] societal interests in broad access to complete and accurate commercial information that First Amendment coverage of commercial speech is designed to safeguard." Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 766 (1993). Massachusetts securities regulation is not motivated by the supposed advantages of consumers "being kept in ignorance," Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra at 769, or designed to "entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy." Central Hudson, supra at 566 n.9. Nor has Massachusetts "burdened a form of protected expression that it found too persuasive," while leaving "unburdened" speech that is "in accord with its own views." Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2672 (2011). Rather, the Massachusetts act and accompanying regulations aid the 


Page 682


"preservation of a fair bargaining process," 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 501 (1996) (plurality opinion), by ensuring the broad availability of accurate and balanced commercial information.   




        For the reasons discussed above, we hold that the challenged provisions of Massachusetts law are part of a constitutionally permissible disclosure scheme, and, to the extent that they restrict speech, are tailored in a reasonable manner to serve a substantial State interest in promoting the integrity of capital markets by ensuring a fully informed investing public.   




  Judgment affirmed.

[Note 1] Opportunity Partners, L.P.; Full Value Partners, L.P.; Opportunity Income Plus Fund, L.P.; Kimball & Winthrop, Inc.; Full Value Advisors, LLC; SPAR Advisors, LLC; Phillip Goldstein; Steven Samuels; Andrew Dakos; Rajeev Das; and Leonard Bloness.     
[Note 2] Among the general partners of Bulldog Investors General Partnership are the plaintiffs Opportunity Partners, L.P.; Full Value Partners, L.P.; and Opportunity Income Plus Fund, L.P., each of which is a hedge fund. The plaintiff Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., is the sole managing general partner of Bulldog Investors General Partnership and the sole general partner of Opportunity Partners, L.P. The plaintiff Full Value Advisors, LLC, is the sole general partner of Full Value Partners, L.P. The plaintiff SPAR Advisors, LLC, is the sole general partner of Opportunity Income Plus Fund, L.P. The plaintiffs Phillip Goldstein, Steven Samuels, Andrew Dakos, and Rajeev Das are each managing members of one or more of the above named limited liability corporations. In addition, Goldstein is president and Samuels is vice-president of Kimball & Winthrop, Inc. Each of these entities and individuals (collectively, Bulldog) was a respondent in the January 31, 2007, administrative complaint.     
[Note 3] The Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) also ordered Bulldog to pay an administrative fine of $25,000, the maximum allowable under § 407A (a) of G. L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (Massachusetts act).     
[Note 4] We do not consider again the plaintiffs' personal jurisdiction arguments, which were resolved in favor of the Secretary in Bulldog Investors Gen. Partnership v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 457 Mass. 210 , 219 (2010) (Bulldog I).     
[Note 5] We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by John Berlau, James McRitchie, Antony Page, Andrew Weinman, and Deirdre Brennan.     
[Note 6] No offer may be made before a registration statement is filed. 15 U.S.C. § 77e(c) (2006). After a registration statement has been filed, but before its effective date, certain offers may be made, but sales must await the effective date. See 15 U.S.C. §§ 77e(b)(1), 77j (2006). See also 1 L. Loss, J. Seligman, & T. Parades, Securities Regulation 695-722 (4th ed. 2006).     
[Note 7] An "[a]ccredited investor" is defined to include, among others, banks, insurance companies, registered investment companies, registered broker-dealers, and natural persons with an individual net worth exceeding $1 million or with annual income exceeding $200,000. 17 C.F.R. § 230.501(a) (2010).     
[Note 8] Under 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 14.402(B)(13)(m) (2000), if an online offer "contains indications that the offer is not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted, then it will be presumed that this offer is not being specifically directed to prospective investors in the Commonwealth." Here, even if the disclaimer on Bulldog's Web site entitled it to a presumption that it had complied with the Massachusetts exemption for Internet offers, Bulldog's electronic mail (e-mail) solicitation to Hickey after he provided a Massachusetts address rebutted that presumption. See Bulldog I, supra at 218, 221.     
[Note 9] The United States Supreme Court has also noted that distinguishing commercial from noncommercial speech protects the latter because "parity of constitutional protection . . . could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the Amendment's guarantee" as to noncommercial speech. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978).     
[Note 10] By contrast, the content of noncommercial speech is fully protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and may be regulated by the government only where such regulation is the least restrictive means to further a compelling State interest. See, e.g., Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989). Strict scrutiny may also be applied to laws that compel particular noncommercial disclosures. See Riley v. National Fed'n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796-797 (1988). Unlike laws requiring particular commercial speech disclosures, such laws attempt to "prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein." Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985) (Zauderer), quoting West Virginia State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943).     
[Note 11] Where the Court has applied the intermediate scrutiny test of Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 557, 566 (1980) (Central Hudson), and upheld a restriction on speech, the challenged restriction generally addressed concerns relating to the means of delivering the regulated speech, rather than the content of the speech itself. In Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447 (1978), the Supreme Court held that a State bar could discipline an attorney for visiting an accident victim in her hospital room and asking her to sign a representation agreement. The Court reasoned that in-person solicitation inherently exerted pressure on the potential client to provide an immediate response to the offer of legal representation, and thereby encouraged "speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking"; solicitation of this sort could well "disserve the individual and societal interest . . . in facilitating 'informed and reliable decisionmaking.' " Id. at 457, 458, quoting Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.S. 350, 364 (1977). See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618 (1995) (upholding Florida bar rules prohibiting attorneys from sending targeted mail solicitations to victims and relatives for thirty days following accident or disaster, concluding that such solicitation is intrusion on privacy that reflects poorly on legal profession). The Court has also upheld a restriction on broadcast advertising where the services advertised were illegal in the broadcaster's State. See United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418 (1993) (upholding Federal statute barring broadcast of lottery advertising by broadcasters located in States that prohibit lotteries).     
[Note 12] In Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2664 (2011), the Supreme Court declared that, where speech is restricted or burdened based on its content, "heightened judicial scrutiny is warranted." The Court explained, however, that heightened scrutiny is required "whenever the government creates 'a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.' " Id., quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989). Unlike the speech restriction at issue in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., supra, the regulation of securities offers at issue in this case is intended to ensure the availability of full and fair information about securities, and does not arise "because of disagreement with the message."     
[Note 13] We further note that in a recent Supreme Court case Justice Thomas invited the Court to state expressly that disclosure requirements are constitutional only where aimed at advertising that is "inherently likely to deceive" or "has in fact been deceptive . . . (emphasis added)." Milavetz, Gallop & Milavetz, P.A. v. United States, 130 S. Ct. 1324, 1344 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), quoting Matter of R.M.J., 455 U.S. 191, 202 (1982). The Court declined to articulate such a limitation, and no other Justice joined Justice Thomas.     
[Note 14] We note that this conclusion accords with the Supreme Court's dicta indicating that the reasonable relation test articulated in Zauderer, supra, is appropriate where a securities regulation is challenged on First Amendment grounds. See Riley v. National Fed'n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796 n.9 (1988), citing Zauderer, supra ("[A]nalogy to the securities field entirely misses the point. Purely commercial speech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements").     
[Note 15] Although the Supreme Court has continued to apply the Central Hudson test, see Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 131 S. Ct. 2653, 2667-2668 (2011); Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 554-555 (2001), we recognize that a number of Supreme Court Justices have over the years expressed criticism of the test. See id. at 571-572 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (expressing "continuing concerns that the [Central Hudson] test gives insufficient protection to truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech"); id. at 572 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) ("I continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be characterized as 'commercial' "); 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 517 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (Central Hudson test "seems to me to have nothing more than policy intuition to support it"). The application of Central Hudson has generated the strongest doubts from members of the Court where advertising has been restricted to quell demand for a lawful advertised product (such as tobacco, alcohol, or gaming), not to preserve "the fair bargaining process." Id. at 501 (plurality opinion). The securities regulations at issue here, however, do not raise this concern.     
[Note 16] Also in evidence was a report of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, entitled Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation (1998), which identified "[f]ull disclosure" as "the most important means for ensuring investor protection," and identified the timely and widespread dissemination of relevant information as fundamental to an efficient market. Id. at 6-7.     
[Note 17] We note that the Secretary's expert did not base his conclusions on empirical evidence, but rather on experience and economic theory. However, the Supreme Court has not required a regulator to put forth empirical evidence of a regulation's effectiveness at addressing a State interest, and has itself relied on common sense and economic reasoning in finding effectiveness. See United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U.S. 418, 428-429 (1993). See also Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, supra at 555; Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U.S. 618, 628 (1995). Only where common sense or evidence in the record suggests a regulation would be ineffective has the Court required more concrete evidence of a regulation's effectiveness. See Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 771-773 (1993) (State regulatory board failed to prove effectiveness of regulation barring in-person solicitation by accountants where evidence in record undercut asserted dangers and board did not supply any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, about need for ban).     
[Note 18] Although the Court stated in Thompson v. Western States Med. Ctr., 535 U.S. 357, 371 (2002) (Thompson), that its previous cases "made clear that if the Government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so," the Court's recent decision in Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., supra at 2667-2668, confirms that Thompson did not overturn Trustees of the State Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 477 (1989) (Fox), or create a least restrictive means test. See also Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 188 (1999) ("Government is not required to employ the least restrictive means conceivable"); Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., supra at 632 ("we made clear that the 'least restrictive means' test has no role in the commercial speech context").     
[Note 19] Another alternative proposed by Bulldog was to prohibit all sales of unregistered securities to Massachusetts residents. This alternative, however, would violate preemption provisions in the 1933 act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77a et seq., which require States to exempt securities that fall under the safe harbor of rule 506 of regulation D from any State registration requirement. See 15 U.S.C. § 77r(b)(4)(D).     
[Note 20] The overbreadth doctrine, which allows a litigant to address a statute's application to parties and scenarios outside the case, should not be confused with the requirement of Central Hudson's fourth prong that restrictions on commercial speech be narrowly drawn. See Central Hudson, supra at 565 n.8 (noting distinction). See also Fox, supra at 482 (same).     
[Note 21] Although the Secretary concedes that he would have no authority to enforce a prohibition against noncommercial speech under the Massachusetts act, this concession is of little comfort if the act in fact allows the suppression of such speech. See United States v. Stevens, 130 S. Ct. 1577, 1591 (2010) ("We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the Government promised to use it responsibly").     
[Note 22] The parties have stipulated that Bloness is an accredited investor within the meaning of 17 C.F.R. § 230.501(a). See note 7, supra.     
[Note 23] See Riley v. National Fed'n of the Blind of N.C., Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796 n.9 (1988) (striking down disclosure requirement in noncommercial speech context but assuring that result had no bearing on securities law); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978) ("Numerous examples could be cited of communications that are regulated without offending the First Amendment, such as the exchange of information about securities . . ."); Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 64 (1973) ("neither the First Amendment nor 'free will' precludes States from having 'blue sky' laws to regulate what sellers of securities may write or publish about their wares"). See also Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Bldrs., Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 758-759 n.5 (1985).

Superior Court of Massachusetts,            County.
BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP, et al.1
             v. WILLIAM F. GALVIN, SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH
CIVIL ACTION No. 07-1261-BLS2
    Decided: September 01, 2009


FINDINGS OF FACT, RULINGS OF LAW, ANDORDER FOR JUDGMENT INTRODUCTIONThis action arises from activities of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth in enforcing Massachusetts securities laws with respect to certain communications regarding hedge funds, particularly a website operated by the group of plaintiffs who will be referred to herein collectively as “Bulldog Investors,”or “Bulldog,”and associated e-mail communication.   The plaintiffs contend that the Secretary's enforcement activities have violated their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.   This Court has issued two previous decisions in this action, one on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, dated December 21, 2007, and one on the defendant's partial motion to dismiss, dated July 28, 2008.2  After a jury-waived trial on July 31, 2009, the Court now enters the following findings of fact, rulings of law, and order for judgment.BACKGROUNDThe stipulation of the parties, along with exhibits admitted by stipulation, provide the following factual background.   Plaintiff Bulldog Investors General Partnership is a general partnership.   Three of its general partners are private investment partnerships known as hedge funds:  the plaintiffs Opportunity Partners, L.P., Full Value Partners, L. P., and Opportunity Income Plus Fund, L.P. The fourth general partner, and managing partner, is the plaintiff Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., which is the sole general partner of Opportunity Partners.   Plaintiffs Full Value Advisors, LLC, and Spar Advisors, LLC, are the sole general partner and investment advisor to Full Value Partners, and Opportunity Income Plus Fund, respectively.   Plaintiffs Steven Samuels, Phillip Goldstein, Andrew Dakos, and Rajeev Das are principals of one or more of the above-described entities.   These entities and individuals will be referred to herein collectively as Bulldog Investors, or Bulldog.   Bulldog Investors has not registered any offering of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).   In 1992 and 2001, respectively, Opportunity Partners and Full Value Fund filed “Form D” with the SEC, claiming exemption from registration requirements.3 Plaintiff Leonard Bloness (“Bloness”), a resident of Sheffield, Massachusetts, is not affiliated with Bulldog Investors.   Bloness desires to have access to information about Bulldog Investors, including the information conveyed through the communications in issue in this case.   He does not intend to, and has never intended to or attempted to, invest in any Bulldog fund.   Bloness is an accredited investor for the purposes of 17 C.F.R. § 230.501(a).From about June 9, 2005, to January 5, 2007, Bulldog Investors maintained an interactive website that provided information about the investment products it offered.   The website made certain information available to any visitor, including press articles and a printable brochure describing Bulldog's three investment vehicles, Opportunity Partners, Full Value Partners, and Opportunity Income Plus Fund. The brochure gave a brief summary of each fund's approach.   It described Opportunity Partners as “a highly diversified fund primarily invested in publicly-traded closed-end mutual funds and operating companies that are selling substantially below their intrinsic values ․ [that] applies the firm's proprietary investment methodology to ‘unlock’ these values.”   Full Value Partners was described as “a fund that concentrates on taking substantial positions in undervalued operating companies and closed-end mutual funds,” and that “acts as a catalyst to ‘unlock’ these values through proprietary means.”   Income Plus Funds, according to the brochure, “is a low-risk fund that primarily invests in undervalued income producing closed-end funds, real estate investment trusts, and other investments ․ attempts to produce better current returns with less risk than is achievable in the bond markets ․ [and] anticipates compounding of capital in addition to generating high current income.”   Each fund, the brochure stated, “will hedge when deemed appropriate.”   A link on the site available to any visitor provided the statement that “Bulldog Investors has delivered a net average annual return significantly higher than that of the S & P 500 Index.   Moreover Bulldog has performed especially well in difficult investment periods like 2000 through 2002.”The website provided additional information to a visitor who would click “I Agree” to the following disclaimer:The information is available for information purposes only and does not constitute solicitation as to any investment service or product and is not an invitation to subscribe for shares or units in any fund herein.   For the avoidance of doubt this website may not be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful or not authorized.   Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information herein, Bulldog Investors accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of information, nor the reasonableness of conclusions based upon such information, which has been obtained from third parties.   The Rates referring specifically to investment products offered by Bulldog Investors are only available for view with a username and password, which can be obtained by contacting the company on the Registration Form provided.   The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise.   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance and investors may not get back the full amount invested.   Changes in the rates of exchange may affect the value of investments.A website visitor seeking more specific information about the funds and their performance could request such information by clicking on a button labeled “send feedback,” which would lead to a registration screen seeking personal identifying information, including the visitor's address.   To register, a visitor would be required to acknowledge having read and agreed to the foregoing disclaimer.On November 10, 2006, Brendan Hickey (“Hickey”), registered on the Bulldog website, entering his Massachusetts address.   Hickey was an employee of a law firm that was representing a client in litigation with Bulldog, and acted at the direction of his employer.   He was not an accredited investor.   Samuels responded to Hickey, by e-mail, attaching additional materials including information about the funds' investment strategy and philosophy, the backgrounds of their managers, performance and recent successes, and news articles.   Samuels's e-mail stated,While we are proud to have one of the best long term records in the business, it is very difficult to adequately describe what, why, and how we do what we do in a quick response to an e-mail inquiry.   Performance numbers for example show nothing of the risk taken to achieve those returns.   I have attached some basic information on our management including performance and philosophy.   I would be happy to spend a few minutes on the phone if you wish to discuss in more detail.   Please contact me at [a telephone number provided].Among the materials Samuels attached to his e-mail to Hickey was a copy of a letter, dated July 13, 2006, directed to investors in Bulldog's funds.   The letter discussed the funds' returns as compared to the Standard & Poor 500 Index, current investments in particular companies, and a lawsuit against the SEC challenging a rule requiring registration of certain hedge fund managers.   It then stated:We don't need a nanny regulator to tell us right from wrong.   And unlike most mutual fund managers, we put our money where our mouths are.   Since day one a significant portion of our net worth has been invested in Full Value Partners so you can be sure that our interests are closely aligned with yours.   In our opinion that is more important than all the cosmetic rules and regulations any regulator can dream up.On January 31, 2007, the enforcement section of the Massachusetts Securities Division filed an administrative complaint with the Acting Director of the Securities Division against Bulldog, alleging that Bulldog had offered securities for sale in the Commonwealth that were not properly registered or exempt, in violation of G.L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, and regulations thereunder, 950 C.M.R. § 10 et seq., by means of the communications appearing in the website.   The enforcement section sought a cease and desist order, an administrative fine, and other relief.   Bulldog answered the administrative complaint on February 21, 2007, denying the allegations and raising as a defense that the administrative complaint abridged its rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.On March 23, 2007, while the administrative proceeding was pending, the plaintiffs filed this action against the Secretary, seeking relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 from the alleged violation of their First amendment Rights.4  Contemporaneously with the filing of the Complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.   The Court (Gants, J.) declined to hear the motion at that time, preferring to await the Secretary's action on the pending administrative complaint.   When the administrative complaint remained pending several months later, after proceedings on cross-motions for summary disposition in the administrative forum, the plaintiffs here renewed their request for preliminary injunctive relief, and this Court set a briefing schedule and scheduled a hearing for October 23, 2007.On October 17, 2006, the Acting Director of the Securities Division issued a final order, on behalf of the Secretary, concluding the administrative proceeding.   The Secretary's final order adopted the hearing officer's findings of fact, consistent with the stipulated facts set forth supra, and her rulings of law, in substance, as follows.   The Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act,G.L. c. 110A, § 301, makes it unlawful for any person to offer securities for sale in the Commonwealth unless the securities are registered, the transaction is exempt, or the security is “federally covered.”   The Act defines an offer to sell to include “every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to buy a security or interest in a security for value.”  G.L. c. 110A,§ 401(2).  The Act further provides that it should be construed so as to coordinate its interpretation and administration consistently with federal securities law.  G.L. c. 110A, § 415.   Under federal case law and SEC decisions, an offer extends beyond the common law contract concept, to include information that “conditions the public interest in particular securities.”   See SEC v. Cavanaugh, 155 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir.1988);  Carl M. Loeb, Rhodes & Co., 38 S.E.C. 843, 850 (1959).Under that definition, the hearing officer ruled, “it is clear respondents have offered securities for sale in the Commonwealth,” by disseminating the information on the website, in combination with the e-mail communication directed to Mr. Hickey.   Citing SEC decisions, the hearing officer rejected the contention that the website material did not constitute an offer because a visitor to the site who sought specific information about funds would have to register, indicating agreement to the disclaimer.   The hearing officer went on to rule that Bulldog had not proved that it was exempt from registration requirements.   The only exemption invoked was that under 950 C.M.R. § 14.02(b)(13)(m), which exempts offers communicated through the internet if not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the Commonwealth,”and presumes that such an offer is not so directed if it “contains indications that the offer is not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted.”   That exemption did not apply, the hearing officer ruled, because of the e-mail, with attached material, directed specifically at a Massachusetts resident.   The hearing officer also ruled that Bulldog's activities were not exempt under other specified regulatory provisions that condition exemption on compliance with a ban on general advertising.   Based on those findings and rulings, the Securities Division ordered that Bulldog cease and desist from further violations, comply with the act, and pay an administrative fine of $25,000.This Court heard argument on the plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunction onOctober 23, 2007.   After receiving supplemental briefs addressed to the Secretary's final decision, the Court issued its decision on the motion on December 21, 2007.   The Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction, concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits.In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted at the outset that the plaintiffs had not identified any court decision, at any level, striking down on First Amendment grounds any statute, regulation, or application of either with respect to the conduct of issuers in offering or advertising securities.5  The Court noted further that the United States Supreme Court has, on a number of occasions, cited the securities area as an example of speech regulation that does not violate the First Amendment.   See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U.S. 749, 758 n. 5 (1985);  Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n, 436 U.S. 447, 456 (1978);  Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 64 (1973);  see also National Association for Adv. of Psychoanalysis v. California.   Bd. of Psych., 228 F.3d 1043, 1054 (9 th Cir.2000);  Securities & Exchange Commission v. Wall Street Pub. Inst., Inc., 851 F.2d 365, 372-373 (D.C.Cir.1988);  Bangor & Arrostook R.R. Company v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 574 F.2d 1096, 1107 (1 st Cir.1978);  European Connections & Tours, Inc., v. Gonzales, 480 F.Supp.2d 1355, 1370 (N. D.Ga.2007);  see generally Michael Siebecker, Corporate Speech, Securities Regulation, and an Institutional Approach to the First Amendment, 48 William & Mary L.Rev. 613, 618, 641-645 (2006).The Court observed that although the Supreme Court's comments on this subject were dicta, their repetition provided strong guidance to this Court in its task of predicting how appellate courts would resolve the question.   See Schwab v. Crosby, 451 F.3d 1308, 1325 (11 th Cir.2006);  Harbury v. Dench, 233 F.3d 596, 604 (D.D. C.2000).The Court proceeded to determine the nature of the conduct affected by the regulation-that is, whether it is speech, and if so, what kind, commercial or non-commercial.   The Court noted the plaintiffs' contention that the communications in issue are non-commercial speech, because they do not propose any commercial transaction, and the defendant's opposing contention that the conduct in issue is not speech at all, but is merely incidental to a regulable transaction, that is, the sale of securities.   See Lowe, 472 U.S. at 232 (“offer and acceptance are communications incidental to the regulable transaction called a contract”).   The Court rejected both arguments, relying on the content of the website materials and e-mail attachments to conclude that they were neither acts of offer and acceptance, in a direct contract sense, nor merely information about hedge funds in general or Bulldog funds in particular, but rather communications in the nature of advertising, calculated to generate interest in investment in Bulldog's funds, directly analogous to the advertising in issue in Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 762 (1976).   On that basis, the Court concluded that the communications were commercial speech, in the sense that the expression is “related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.”   Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 561 (1980).   Accordingly, the Court applied the four-part test set forth in that decision to evaluate the validity of the Secretary's enforcement of the Massachusetts statute and regulations.With respect to the first prong of the test, the Court concluded that the speech provided truthful information about lawful activities-that is, operation of hedge funds, and investment in them.   On the second prong, the Court identified the state interest advanced as justification for the regulatory scheme:  to protect the integrity of capital markets, and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information.   The Court concluded that this interest is substantial, noting the catastrophic consequences of the absence of effective regulation manifested during the Great Depression, following which Congress enacted the Federal Securities Act of 1933, and states, including Massachusetts, enacted various corresponding provisions.   See S.E.C. v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 186-187 (1963);  S.E.C. v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U.S. 119, 124-125 (1953);  In the matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., 38 S.E.C. at 848;  Smith v. Fishback, 123 S.W.2d 771, 778 (Tex.Civ.App.1938);  In re Leach, 215 Cal. 536, 543 (1932);  Stewart v. Brady, 300 Ill. 425, 430 (1921);  Kneeland v. Emerton, 280 Mass. at 387-388;  see also Merrick v. Halsey & Co., 242 U.S. 568, 586-588 (1917);  Hall v. Geiger-Jones Company,242 U.   S. 539, 539-540 (1916);  compare G.L. c. 110A, § 301 with 15 U.S.C. § 77e;  compareG.L. c. 110A, § 101 with 15 U.S.C. § 78(b);  see also G.L. c. 110A, § 302.The Court then turned to the third and fourth prongs of the Central Hudson test, which, together, determine whether the regulation is “in proportion to that interest.”   These prongs ask whether a challenged regulation directly advances the state interest, and whether the interest “could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech․”  447 U.S. at 564.   The Court concluded, based on the limited record available at the preliminary injunction stage, that the Secretary was likely to succeed in showing that the regulatory scheme satisfies both prongs.   As to the third prong, the Court expressed the view that the statute and regulations serve the state's interest directly by limiting solicitation of offers to those who have made full disclosure in connection with registration.   See G.L. c. 110A, § 301.The Court identified the fourth prong of the Central Hudson test as the most difficult to apply, but found it likely that the Secretary would succeed in showing “a ‘fit’ between the legislature's ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,'․ a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable;  that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest served.’ ”  Board of Trustees of the St. Univ. of N.Y. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480 (1980), quoting Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 341 (1986), and In re R.M. J., 455 U.S. 191, 203 (1982).   In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted particularly that the essence of the regulatory scheme was the requirement of disclosure, and that disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertiser's interests than do flat prohibitions on speech,”so that “an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.”  Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,471 U.S. 626, 651 (1985).   See also Pharmaceutical Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 316 (1 st Cir.2005).   Based on these conclusions, the Court denied the motion for preliminary injunction.After that ruling, the parties conducted discovery, exchanged information, and negotiated a comprehensive stipulation.   In addition to the factual background as set forth supra, the parties stipulated to certain matters of mixed fact and law, and to certain limitations on the issues to be litigated.   The parties agreed, for purposes of the Central Hudson test, that Bulldog's communications through the combination of its website and the e-mail were not misleading and did not relate to any unlawful transaction.   The parties also agreed that “it is a substantial state interest” of Massachusetts “to protect the integrity of capital markets, and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate information.”   Thus, the parties agreed, the only disputed issues under the Central Hudson test are the third and fourth prongs 6 :  whether the statute and regulations directly advance that interest, and whether they intrude on speech more than necessary to achieve the government's interest.   See Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564.   The parties further stipulated that, for the purposes of determining whether the regulatory scheme is more intrusive than necessary, the Court need not consider any alternatives other than the eleven proposals suggested by Bulldog and set forth in the stipulation.7 The evidence at trial, held on July 31, 2009, consisted of a set of agreed exhibits, and the expert testimony of Professor Joseph Franco of Suffolk University Law School, a law professor with specialized training and experience in economics and securities regulation.   Among the exhibits is an extensive written report of Professor Franco, expressing opinions consistent with his trial testimony, and addressing in detail each of the plaintiffs' proposed alternatives.   Professor Franco's opinion, in substance, is that the regulatory scheme directly serves the identified governmental interest, and that none of the alternatives would do so as effectively.   FINDINGS, RULINGS, AND DISCUSSIONAs a threshold matter, each side contends that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, without the need for any findings of fact, and without application of the Central Hudson test.   The Secretary, as he did at the preliminary injunction stage, and citing the same authorities, argues that advertising of securities is not speech and does not implicate the first amendment at all.   The Court rejects that contention for the same reasons stated in its preliminary injunction decision.8 The plaintiffs raise an argument the Court has not previously addressed.   Citing Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.S. 525, 561 (2001),9 plaintiffs argue that, regardless of what facts might appear in the record with respect to the interest served by the regulatory scheme and the effectiveness of it in serving that interest, a court must strike down a regulation affecting speech unless the government shows that, prior to adopting the challenged regulation, the regulatory official actually conducted an evaluation of its effect on speech and weighed that effect against alternative, less restrictive methods to protect the governmental interest.   Because the Secretary is unable to make such a showing, the plaintiffs argue, they are entitled to prevail.The Court does not read Lorillard, and the other cases cited, as establishing the rule the plaintiffs propose.   Indeed, the Supreme Court did not actually apply such a standard in Lorillard itself.   Although the record there did not indicate that the Massachusetts Attorney General had actually conducted a cost benefit analysis before adopting the regulations, the Court did not treat that failure as determinative.   Rather, the Court applied the standards established in Central Hudson to the evidentiary record developed in the litigation as justification for the regulations.10  The Court applied the same type of analysis a year later in Thompson v. Western States Medical Center, 535 U.S. 357, 372 (2002), where it considered the legislative history of the statute underlying the challenged regulations, but also looked to the justification advanced in the evidentiary record developed in the course of the litigation, as well as justifications advanced in briefs before the Court.   Indeed, plaintiffs have not identified any case in which a court has struck down regulations on the ground the plaintiffs urge this Court to apply, based solely on the government's inability to prove that the regulatory authority actually engaged in a balancing process before adopting the regulations, without regard to evidence offered in the litigation as to the justification for the regulations.11 The approach the courts have taken, in contrast to the one the plaintiffs propose, reflects the realities of the regulatory process at the state level, which may not involve recorded legislative or regulatory history of the sort compiled at the federal level.   It reflects also the presumption of regularity that Courts properly grant to acts of the other branches.   Further, the approach the Courts have applied avoids the formalistic results that would flow from rulings issued on the basis the plaintiffs propose.12 The Court therefore concludes, as it did at the preliminary injunction stage, that Central Hudson provides the test by which the Court must evaluate the Secretary's action.13  The first step in applying that test is to determine that the commercial speech at issue concerns lawful activity and is not misleading.  Central Hudson, 447 U.S. at 564.   Here, as stated supra, the parties have so stipulated.If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government's power is more circumscribed.   The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.   Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest.   The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal.   Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria.   First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved;  the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose.   Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive.Id. at 564.   As indicated supra, the parties have stipulated to the second prong as well as the first:  the governmental interest to be served by the regulations, “to protect the integrity of capital markets, and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information,” is substantial.   The dispute centers on the third and fourth prongs.Before addressing the evidence relating to those issues, it bears noting that, what the parties and other courts have referred to as the third and fourth prongs are not so labeled in Central Hudson itself.   Rather, Central Hudson refers to these as criteria by which to measure compliance with the requirement of proportionality.   As the Supreme Court said, “the regulatory technique must be in proportion to [the substantial state interest asserted].   The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State's goal.”   The so-called third and fourth prongs are not independent requirements, to be applied mechanically;  they are a means of evaluating the proportional relationship between the challenged regulation and the substantial interest it seeks to serve.The so-called third prong requires that the restriction “directly advance the state interest involved;  the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose.”   The plaintiffs seize on the word “directly” to argue that the relationship between the regulation and its purpose must be direct in a literal sense, in that the effectiveness of the regulation to achieve its goals does not depend on any intermediate steps or incentives.   The Court does not adopt that interpretation, which is not supported either by the language of Central Hudson or by any other identified authority.  Central Hudson explains the meaning of “direct”:  “the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government's purpose.”   The requirement of direct support obligates the government to show that the challenged regulation will not only advance the government's stated interest, “but also that it will do so ‘to a material degree.’ ”  44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.S. 484, 505 (1996), quoting Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 771 (1993).   See also Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Ass'n, Inc. v. United States, 527 U.S. 173, 188 (1999) (the third prong of the Central Hudson inquiry “is not satisfied by mere speculation or conjecture;  rather, a governmental body seeking to sustain a restriction on commercial speech must demonstrate that the harms it recites are real and that its restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree”).To establish the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme in issue here, the Secretary has offered the expert opinion of Professor Franco.   Having considered Professor Franco's credentials, his reasoning, and his demeanor, the Court finds his opinions well-founded and highly credible, and adopts them in substance.   On the issue of effectiveness, Professor Franco emphasizes that the ban on general advertising of unregistered securities must be considered in conjunction with the general requirement of registration, which mandates disclosure of all material information about securities offered to the public.   The public filing of a registration statement, conforming in both form and content to uniform regulatory requirements, serves to provide complete, balanced, and accurate information not only to those who might consider investing in a particular offering, but also to the public as a whole, including regulatory officials, private analysts, large investors, and the news media, whose review serves as a powerful check on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided.   That process tends to result in market prices that accurately reflect value, for the benefit of all investors, both those purchasing the particular issue and those trading in other securities.   The ban on general advertising of unregistered securities, Professor Franco opines, provides a powerful incentive for issuers to register, despite the substantial costs of doing so, thereby maximizing the benefits of the registration system to the public as a whole;  indeed, in his view, it is vital to the effectiveness of the registration system.   The Court adopts this opinion, and so finds.14  It follows that the ban on general solicitation of unregistered securities effectively promotes registration, which, in turn, effectively serves the state interest in market integrity.   Professor Franco does not purport to quantify the effectiveness of the regulatory scheme, and the Court is not in a position to do so.   The case law does not establish a precise level of effectiveness that must be achieved;  Central Hudson indicates only that the regulation must effect something more than “remote” support for the state interest served.   The Court is satisfied that that standard is met here.The Court therefore turns to the fourth prong of the Central Hudson Test:  whether “the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech.”   The phrase “as well” bears noting;  the test is not whether some less restrictive approach might also serve the state's interest, but whether it would do so as well as the challenged regulation.   Central Hudson does not elaborate on what is meant by “as well.”   The Court construes the phrase as referring to effectiveness in relation to the cost and burden of the regulatory scheme to the public-that is, could a less restrictive regulatory approach serve the state interest as effectively, at the same or approximately the same cost, both in public resources expended for administration and enforcement, and in private resources required for compliance?To satisfy the fourth prong of the Central Hudson inquiry, the government must show “a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable;  that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served, that employs not necessarily the least restrictive means but ․ a means narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.”  Florida Bar v. Went for It, 515 U.S. at 632.   In evaluating the “fit,” courts have been “loath to second-guess the Government's judgment,” relying on the state's judgment “so long as its judgment was reasonable.”   Board of Trustees, 492 U.S. at 479.   That deference serves to “provide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed leeway in a field (commercial speech) ‘traditionally subject to governmental regulation.’ ”  Id. at 480, quoting Ohralik, 436 U.S. at 455-456.   See Board of Trustees, 492 U.S. at 480-481 (“By declining to impose ․ a least-restrictive-means requirement, we take account of the difficulty of establishing with precision the point at which restrictions become more restrictive than their objective requires, and provide the Legislative and Executive branches needed leeway in a field ․ traditionally subject to governmental regulation”).“A regulation need not be absolutely the least severe that will achieve the desired end, but if there are numerous and obvious less-burdensome alternatives to the restriction on commercial speech, that is certainly a relevant consideration in determining whether the fit between ends and means is reasonable.”  Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 417 n.13 (1993) (internal quotation omitted).  “[I]f the Government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so.”  Thompson v. Western States Med. Ctr., 535 U.S. at 371;  see Lorillard Tobacco Co., 533 U.S. at 566.   What is required is that “the regulation not ‘burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.’ ”  Board of Trustees, 492 U.S. at 478, quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989).The Court also keeps in mind that the crux of the overall scheme established by both the state and federal securities laws is the requirement of registration.   Registration serves not to restrict speech, but to expand it, by ensuring that any public offer to sell securities is accompanied by full disclosure of all material information.   See Ralston Purina,346 U.S. at 124 n. 10 (quoting preamble to Federal Securities Act of 1933, “An Act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce ․ and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof”);  see also Wall Street Pub. Inst., 851 F.2d at 372.   Disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertiser's interests than do flat prohibitions on speech.”  Zauderer, 471 U.S. at 651.   For that reason, the high Court has held, “an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.”  Id. See Florida Bar v. Went for It, 515 U.S. at 634 (remarking on the “many alternative channels” available to commercial speakers).To evaluate the eleven alternative approaches the plaintiffs propose, the Secretary again offers Professor Franco's opinions.   As Professor Franco explained, the plaintiffs' proposals overlap.   All of them would eliminate the prohibition on general advertising of unregistered securities.   Some would replace it with provisions of various kinds that would focus on the point of sale, such as requirements of notice of sales to the Secretary of State and of a right to rescind within a specified time;  increased requirements of verification, documentation and record keeping to confirm accredited status of purchasers;  licensing of accredited investors;  and the like.   Others offer no regulatory replacement, proposing merely more intensive enforcement of anti-fraud prohibitions or of prohibitions on sales to unaccredited investors.In Professor Franco's view, all of the plaintiffs' proposals would reduce the incentive to register, and encourage issuers to make unregistered offerings, sacrificing lawful access to some potential buyers in favor of saving the costs of registration.   In addition, all of the proposals would likely result in increased “distortive” (that is, unbalanced) communications, increased incidence of unlawful transactions (such as sales to unaccredited investors), and proliferation of scams.   Those proposals that rely on increased enforcement activity in connection with sales would suffer from the problem of coming after, rather than before transactions, when dissipation of assets may prevent effective remedies.   In addition, proposals requiring increased enforcement, to be effective, would require expenditure of increased public resources.   Some would also raise issues of federal preemption, to the extent that they are inconsistent with the existing federal scheme of securities regulation.   In all of these respects, Professor Franco opined, the plaintiffs' proposals would decrease the protection of investors and impair market integrity.   For the reasons already explained, the Court credits Professor Franco's opinions.   On that basis, the Court finds that none of the proposed alternatives would serve the governmental interest in market integrity as well as the existing regulatory scheme.To counter Professor Franco's opinions, the plaintiffs rely on two documents, submitted as stipulated exhibits at trial:  A report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from its Advisory Committee on Smaller Public Companies, dated April 23, 2006;  and a letter to the SEC, dated April 3, 2006, from the Committee on Securities Regulation of the New York City Bar, commenting on an “exposure draft” of that report.   The Advisory Committee Report recommends to the SEC that it relax prohibitions on general solicitation and advertising in certain respects.   The New York City Bar expresses support for that recommendation.15  Both documents identify the rationale and purpose for the authors' position as the promotion of capital formation.Capital formation is, of course, an important goal, which is to some degree in tension with investor protection and market integrity.   Regulatory constraints that protect market integrity impose burdens on issuers and sellers of securities.   In that respect, they may tend to impede capital formation.   It follows that relaxation of such regulatory restraints might ease capital formation.   The state regulatory scheme in issue here, and the corresponding federal scheme, reflect a regulatory choice to emphasize market integrity over capital formation.   This Court has no authority to second-guess that choice.   Rather, once it has been established (as it has been here by stipulation), that the interest the regulator seeks to serve is a substantial one, the Court's role is to determine whether the means the Secretary has chosen to effectuate that choice is proportional to that interest, as measured by the criteria articulated in Central Hudson.   Neither the Advisory Committee's report nor the New York City Bar's letter purports to address that issue, and neither sheds any light on it.The Court concludes, based on the stipulated facts and the evidence presented at trial, that the statute and regulations in issue, and the Secretary's enforcement action against Bulldog Investors, meet the test of Central Hudson, and do not violate the First Amendment rights either of Bulldog or of Mr. Bloness.   A declaration will enter to that effect.   CONCLUSION AND ORDERFor the reasons stated, the Court orders that JUDGMENT enter for the defendant, declaring that the challenged statute, regulations and enforcement action do not violate the plaintiffs' rights under the First Amendment.   Counsel are directed to submit a proposed form of Judgment forthwith.FOOTNOTESFN2. The Court has also issued a memorandum of decision and entered final judgment in a related action, no.   07-05038-BLS2, the plaintiffs' petition for judicial review of the Secretary's final decision pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14.   Plaintiffs' appeal from the judgment in that case is now pending before the Appeals Court..  FN2. The Court has also issued a memorandum of decision and entered final judgment in a related action, no.   07-05038-BLS2, the plaintiffs' petition for judicial review of the Secretary's final decision pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14.   Plaintiffs' appeal from the judgment in that case is now pending before the Appeals Court.FN3. Form D refers to a filing under Rule 506 of SEC Regulation D.

	COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS

SUFFOLK, ss.	
SUPERIOR COURT
CIVIL ACTION
No. 07-1261-BLS2 

BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP, et al.[1]
vs.
WILLIAM F. GALVIN, SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH, and PATRICK AHEARN, CHIEF OF ENFORCEMENT, SECURITIES DIVISION OF THE OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH

MEMORANDUM OF DECISION AND ORDER ON 
PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
	INTRODUCTION 


This action arises from activities of the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth in enforcing Massachusetts securities laws with respect to certain communications regarding hedge funds, particularly a website operated by the group of plaintiffs who will be referred to herein collectively as “Bulldog Investors,”or “Bulldog,”and associated e-mail communication.  The plaintiffs contend that the Secretary’s enforcement activities have violated their rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and under the Commerce Clause.  They seek injunctive relief and damages.  Presently before the Court is the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.  For the reasons that will be explained, the motion will be denied.
BACKGROUND[2]
Plaintiff Bulldog Investors General Partnership is a general partnership.  Three of its general partners are private investment partnerships known as hedge funds: the plaintiffs Opportunity Partners, L.P., Full Value Partners, L. P., and Opportunity Income Fund, L.P.  The fourth general partner, and managing partner, is the plaintiff Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., which is the sole general partner of Opportunity Partners Fund.  Plaintiffs Full Value Advisors, LLC, and Spar Advisors, LLC, are the sole general partner and investment advisor to Full Value Fund and Income Plus Fund, respectively.  Plaintiffs Phillip Goldstein, Steven Samuels, Andrew Dakos, and Rajeev Das are principals of one or more of the above-described entities.  These entities and individuals will be referred to herein collectively as Bulldog Investors, or Bulldog. Bulldog Investors has not registered any offering of securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  In 1992 and 2001, respectively, Opportunity Partners and Full Value Fund filed “Form D” with the SEC, claiming exemption from registration requirements.[3]    Plaintiff Leonard Bloness, a resident of Massachusetts, is not affiliated with Bulldog Investors, as far as the materials before the Court disclose; he alleges that he “desires to have access to and to read the information contained in the Bulldog Investors website but is not interested in investing in any security mentioned or described in that website.”  
From about June 9, 2005, to January 5, 2007, Bulldog Investors maintained an interactive website that provided information about investment products offered by Bulldog Investors.  The website made certain information available to any visitor, including press articles and a printable brochure describing Bulldog’s three investment vehicles, Opportunity Partners, Full Value Partners, and Income Plus Fund.  The description gave a brief summary of each fund’s approach.  It described Opportunity Partners as “a highly diversified fund primarily invested in publicly-traded closed-end mutual funds and operating companies that are selling substantially below their intrinsic values . . . [that] applies the firm’s proprietary investment methodology to ‘unlock’ these values.”  Full Value Partners was described as “a fund that concentrates on taking substantial positions in undervalued operating companies and closed-end mutual funds,” and that “acts as a catalyst to ‘unlock’ these values through proprietary means.”  Income Plus Funds, according to the brochure, “is a low-risk fund that primarily invests in undervalued income producing closed-end funds, real estate investment trusts, and other investments . . . attempts to produce better current returns with less risk than is achievable in the bond markets    . . . [and] anticipates compounding of capital in addition to generating high current income.”  Each fund, the brochure stated, “will hedge when deemed appropriate.”  A link on the site available to any visitor provided the statement that “Bulldog Investors has delivered a net average annual return significantly higher than that of the S&P 500 Index.  Moreover Bulldog has performed especially well in difficult investment periods like 2000 through 2002.”
The website provided additional information to a visitor who would click “I Agree” to the following disclaimer:
The information is available for information purposes only and does not constitute solicitation as to any investment service or product and is not an invitation to subscribe for shares or units in any fund herein.  For the avoidance of doubt this website may not be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful or not authorized.  Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information herein, Bulldog Investors accepts no responsibility for the accuracy of information, nor the reasonableness of conclusions based upon such information, which has been obtained from third parties.  The Rates referring specifically to investment products offered by Bulldog Investors are only available for view with a username and password, which can be obtained by contacting the company on the Registration Form provided.  The value of investments and the income from them can fall as well as rise.  Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance and investors may not get back the full amount invested.  Changes in the Rates of exchange may affect the value of investments.	

A website visitor seeking more specific information about the funds and their performance could request such information by clicking on a button labeled “send feedback,” which would lead to a registration screen seeking personal identifying information.  To register a visitor would be required to indicate agreement to the disclaimer.  At least one Massachusetts resident, one Brendan Hickey, did so on or about November 10, 2006.  Steven Samuels responded to Hickey, by e-mail, attaching additional materials including information about the funds’ investment strategy and philosophy, the backgrounds of their managers, performance and recent successes, and news articles.  Samuels’s e-mail stated, “While we are proud to have one of the best long term records in the business, it is very difficult to adequately describe what, why, and how we do what we do in a quick response to an e-mail inquiry. Performance numbers for example show nothing of the risk taken to achieve those returns.  I have attached some basic information on our management including performance and philosophy.  I would be happy to spend a few minutes on the phone if you wish to discuss in more detail.  Please contact me at” a telephone number provided.  
Among the materials Samuels attached to his e-mail to Hickey was one item that is the subject of considerable argument among the parties here: a copy of a letter, dated July 13, 2006, directed to investors in Bulldog’s funds.  The letter discusses the funds’ returns as compared to the Standard & Poor 500 Index, current investments in particular companies, and a lawsuit against the SEC challenging a rule requiring registration of certain hedge fund managers.  It then states:  
We don’t need a nanny regulator to tell us right from wrong.  And unlike most mutual fund managers, we put our money where our mouths are.  Since day one a significant portion of our net worth has been invested in Full Value Partners so you can be sure that our interests are closely aligned with yours.  In our opinion that is more important than all the cosmetic rules and regulations any regulator can dream up.

On January 31, 2007, the enforcement section of the Massachusetts Securities Division filed an administrative complaint with the Acting Director of the Securities Division against Bulldog Investors, alleging that Bulldog had offered securities for sale in the Commonwealth that were not properly registered or exempt, in violation of G. L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act, and regulations thereunder, 950 C. M. R. § 10 et seq., by means of the communications appearing in the website.  The enforcement section sought a cease and desist order, an administrative fine, and other relief.  Bulldog Investors answered the administrative complaint on February 21, 2007, denying the allegations and raising as a defense the allegation that the complaint abridged its rights under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article XVI of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. 
On March 23, 2007, while the administrative proceeding was pending, the plaintiffs filed this action.  The complaint in this Court names Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin and Chief of Enforcement Patrick Ahearn.[4]  The complaint alleges that the conduct that forms the basis of the administrative complaint is “protected by the free speech and free press guarantees in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Article XVI of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights,” and that the administrative proceeding chills the exercise of those rights, in that “[b]ut for the threat of sanctions and the litigation burden imposed by the Secretary, the Bulldog Investors website would continue to operate as it did prior to the Secretary’s action.”  The complaint asserts claims under the federal and state civil rights acts, 42 U. S. C. § 1983, and G. L. c. 12, § 11I, and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including a preliminary injunction.[5] 
Contemporaneously with the filing of the complaint, the plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  The Court (Gants, J.) declined to hear the motion at that time, preferring to await the Secretary’s action on the pending administrative complaint.  When the administrative complaint remained pending several months later, after proceedings on cross-motions for summary disposition, the plaintiffs in this action renewed their request for preliminary injunctive relief, and the Court set a briefing schedule and scheduled a hearing for October 23, 2007.  On October 17, 2006, the Acting Director of the Securities Division issued a final order, on behalf of the Secretary, concluding the administrative proceeding.  
The Court held a hearing on October 23, 2007, as scheduled.  In light of the Secretary’s issuance of the final order, the Court at that time granted all parties’ request for leave to file supplemental memoranda, which the Court received on November 30, 2007.  The plaintiffs now direct their request for a preliminary injunction toward enforcement of the final order, as well as any further effort at enforcement by the Secretary’s enforcement section.  Their supplemental memoranda add a Commerce Clause theory to the First Amendment claim originally raised. 	The Secretary’s final order adopted the hearing officer’s findings of fact, as set forth supra, as well as her rulings of law, in substance, as follows.  The Massachusetts Securities Act, G. L. c. 110A, § 301, makes it unlawful for any person to offer securities for sale in the Commonwealth unless the securities are registered, the transaction is exempt, or the security is “federally covered.”  The Act defines an offer to sell to include “every attempt or offer to dispose of or solicitation of an offer to buy a security or interest in a security for value.”  G. L. c. 110A, 
§ 401(2).  The Act further provides that it should be construed so as to coordinate its interpretation and administration consistently with federal securities law.  G. L. c . 110A, § 415.  Under federal case law and SEC decisions, an offer extends beyond the common law contract concept, to include information that “conditions the public interest in particular securities.”  See SEC v. Cavanaugh, 155 F.3d 129, 135 (2d Cir. 1988), and Carl M. Loeb, Rhodes & Co., 
38 S. E. C. 843, 850 (1959).  Under that definition, the hearing officer ruled, “it is clear respondents have offered securities for sale in the Commonwealth,” by disseminating the information on the website, in combination with the e-mail communication directed to Mr. Hickey.  
Citing SEC decisions, the hearing officer rejected the contention that the website material did not constitute an offer because a visitor to the site who sought specific information about funds would have to register, indicating agreement to the disclaimer.  The hearing officer went on to rule that Bulldog had not proved that it was exempt from registration requirements.  The only exemption invoked was that under 950 C. M. R. § 14.02(b)(13)(m), which exempts offers communicated through the internet if not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the Commonwealth,”and presumes that such an offer is not so directed if it “contains indications that the offer is not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted.”  That exemption did not apply, the hearing officer ruled, because of the e-mail, with attached material, directed specifically at a Massachusetts resident.  The hearing officer also ruled that Bulldog’s activities were not exempt under other specified regulatory provisions that condition exemption on compliance with a ban on general advertising.  Based on those findings and rulings, the Securities Division ordered that Bulldog cease and desist from further violations, comply with the act, and pay an administrative fine of $25,000.  The Securities Division stayed the imposition of sanctions pending this Court’s ruling on the motion for preliminary injunction.  
Affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs provide certain additional background information.[6]  Leonard Bloness asserts that he has “no intention ever to invest in any hedge fund,” but is interested in learning about hedge funds “as a part of the process of striving to be a well educated investor.”  He is interested in Bulldog Investors in particular because “Bulldog’s managers employ investment strategies that are somewhat similar” to his, so that information about Bulldog assists him in carrying out those strategies.  In his view, the statement that fund managers’ investment in the funds they manage “closely aligns” their interests with those of investors is “well accepted” and not misleading.  Further, he asserts, he is fully competent to analyze the accuracy of the information presented, and has no need for regulatory protection from such statements.  
DISCUSSION
Under the well-established test of Packaging Indus. Group v. Cheney, 380 Mass. 609, 617 (1980), a preliminary injunction is warranted only when the moving party establishes both a likelihood of success on the merits of the claim, and a substantial risk of irreparable harm in the absence of an injunction.  If both those factors are established, the Court must balance them against the harm that an injunction will inflict on the opposing party.  Id.  Where, as here, the opposing party is a public official performing a regulatory function for the protection of the public, the Court must also carefully consider the impact an injunction would have on the public interest.  See Tri-Nel Mgmt., Inc. v. Board of Health of Barnstable, 433 Mass. 217, 219 (2001); 
T & D Video, Inc., v. City of Revere, 423 Mass. 577, 580 (1996). 
The Court thus begins the analysis with the issue of likelihood of success on the merits of the claims pled in the complaint: that the Massachusetts securities act, on its face and as applied to Bulldog’s conduct in connection with its website and e-mail communication, violates the federal and state civil rights acts by infringing on free speech rights guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions.[7] [8]  The parties have focused their attention on the federal claim, and the Court will do the same.[9] 
At the outset, it bears noting that the plaintiffs have not identified any court decision, at any level, striking down on First Amendment grounds any statute, regulation, or application of either with respect to the conduct of issuers in offering or advertising securities.[10]  To the contrary, the United States Supreme Court has, on a number of occasions, cited the securities area as an example of speech regulation that does not violate the First Amendment.  See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., v. Greenmoss Builders, 472 U. S. 749, 758 n. 5 (1985); Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass’n, 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978); Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U. S. 49, 64 (1973); see also National Association for Adv. of Psychoanalysis v. California. Bd. of Psych., 228 F.3d 1043, 1054 (9th Cir. 2000); Securities & Exchange Commission v. Wall Street Pub. Inst., Inc., 851 F.2d 365, 372-373 (D. C. Cir. 1988); Bangor & Arrostook R.R. Company v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 574 F.2d 1096, 1107 (1st Cir. 1978); European Connections & Tours, Inc., v. Gonzales, 480 F. Supp. 2d 1355, 1370 (N. D. Ga. 2007); see generally Michael Siebecker, Corporate Speech, Securities Regulation, and an Institutional Approach to the First Amendment, 48 William & Mary L. Rev. 613, 618, 641-645 (2006).  These statements are dicta, to be sure; the high Court has not yet directly confronted the question presented here.  That the Court has repeatedly stated its assumption to that effect, however, provides strong guidance to this Court in its task of predicting how appellate courts will resolve the question.  See Schwab v. Crosby, 
451 F.3d 1308, 1325 (11th Cir. 2006); Harbury v. Dench, 233 F.3d 596, 604 (D. D. C. 2000).  
The First Amendment analysis must begin with a determination of the nature of the conduct affected by the regulation – that is, is the conduct speech, and if so, what kind, commercial or non-commercial?  The plaintiffs contend that the communications in issue are non-commercial speech, because they do not propose any commercial transaction.  They also point to the comment quoted supra in the letter, which they characterize as political speech.  Defendants argue that the conduct in issue is not speech at all, but is merely incidental to a regulable transaction, that is, the sale of securities.  See Lowe, 472 U. S. at 232 (“offer and acceptance are communications incidental to the regulable transaction called a contract”).  	The Court is not persuaded by either of these arguments.  Review of the website materials and e-mail attachments leaves no doubt that they are neither acts of offer and acceptance, in a direct contract sense, nor merely information about hedge funds in general or Bulldog funds in particular.  Rather, they are in the nature of advertising, calculated to generate interest in investment in Bulldog’s funds, directly analogous to the advertising in issue in Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976).  That such communications constitute offering within the broad definition of the securities laws does not in itself make them action as opposed to expression for purposes of the First Amendment.  
The nature of the expression involved here, however, is clearly commercial, in the sense that the expression is “related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.”  Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Serv. Comm’n, 447 U. S. 557, 561 (1980).  That is true of the comment in the letter as well as the other materials; the inclusion of political commentary in otherwise commercially oriented speech does not change its fundamental character.  See Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 474-475 (1989); Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U. S. 626, 637 n. 7 (1985); Bolger v. Drugs Products Corp., 
463 U. S. 60, 68 (1983).  
After a period of considerable uncertainty on the point, a series of United States Supreme Court decisions has established that the First Amendment “protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation.”  See Central Hudson, 447 U. S. at 561, citing Virginia Pharm. Bd., 425 U. S. at 761-762.  However, “[t]he constitution . . . accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression . . . .  The protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation.”  Central Hudson, 447 U. S. at 563 (internal citation omitted).  The Court has established a four part test to evaluate restrictions on commercial speech.  
First, a reviewing court must consider whether the speech provides truthful information about lawful activity.  “There can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity.  The government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it, . . . or commercial speech related to illegal activity.”  Id. at 563-564 (citations omitted).  From there, the analysis proceeds as follows:
If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government’s power is more circumscribed.  The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech.  Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest.  The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State’s goal.  Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria.  First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose.  Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive. 

Id. at 564.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed this four-part test just a few years ago in Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U. S. 525, 555 (2001).  
Defendants argue both that the speech relates to unlawful activity, and that it is misleading.  On the issue of unlawful activity, Defendants point out that sales of unregistered securities to unaccredited investors, not subject to any other exemption, would violate federal law, 15 U.S.C. §77e.  In the absence of any evidence either way, they urge the Court to assume that Mr. Hickey is not an accredited investor, so that advertising to him was communication about a sale that would be unlawful.  The Court is not persuaded on this point.  The communications in issue certainly appear designed to elicit interest in investing among the public generally, but their content does not address investing by unaccredited investors.  Operation of hedge funds, and investment in them, is not unlawful as a general matter.  
Defendants argue that the statement in the letter to investors that “our interests are closely aligned with yours” is misleading.[11]  They base that contention on Goldstein v. SEC, 
451 F.3d 873, 887  (D. C. Cir. 2006).  In that case, brought by one of the Bulldog plaintiffs in this case, the Court held that investors in a hedge fund are not clients of the fund’s advisor for purposes of a rule under which exemption from registration depends on the number of the advisor’s clients.  If investors were clients, the  Court reasoned, fund advisors would be subject to conflicting duties, because investors’ interests would depart from those of the fund in circumstances of financial distress.  Id., 451 F.3d at 873.  
The Goldstein decision recognizes that the interests of fund advisers and investors can depart under certain circumstances.  The letter does not say otherwise.  The point it expresses is that Bulldog’s fund advisors are themselves investors in the fund, so that they share the interests of other investors in the fund’s performance.  Fuller disclosure might lend context to that statement, and prevent any exaggerated interpretation of it, but nothing before the Court
indicates that the statement itself is untrue.[12]  The Court is not persuaded that the statement contained in the letter is misleading in the sense that would deprive it of First Amendment protection under Central Hudson.  
Since the information communicated has not been shown to be either misleading or related to unlawful activity, the Court must turn to the second step of the Central Hudson analysis, which involves consideration of the interest the State seeks to serve by the regulation.  That interest is to protect the integrity of capital markets, and thereby to preserve the overall health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate material information.  The Great Depression brought home the importance of the interest, by demonstrating the catastrophic consequences of the absence of effective regulation in this area.  In its wake, Congress enacted the Federal Securities Act of 1933, and states enacted various corresponding provisions.  See S.E.C. v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U. S. 180, 186-187 (1963); S. E. C. v. Ralston Purina Co., 346 U. S. 119, 124-125 (1953); In the matter of Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., 38 S. E. C. at 848; Smith v. Fishback, 123 S.W.2d 771, 778 (Tex. Civ. App. 1938); In re Leach, 215 Cal. 536, 543 (1932); Stewart v. Brady, 300 Ill. 425, 430 (1921); Kneeland v. Emerton, 280 Mass. at 387-388; see also Merrick v. Halsey & Co., 242 U. S. 568, 586-588 (1917); Hall v. Geiger-Jones Company, 242 U. S. 539, 539-540 (1916).  The Massachusetts Securities Act tracks the federal act, and seeks to serve the same purposes.  Compare G. L. c. 110A, § 301 with 15 U.S.C. § 77e; compare G. L. c. 110A, § 101 with 15 U.S.C. §78(b); see also G. L. c. 110A, § 302.  The decisions cited supra, which refer to securities regulation as the quintessential example of justified speech regulation, unequivocally recognize the substantiality of the interests served.  See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., 472 U. S. at 758 n. 5, Ohralik, 436 Mass. U. S. at 456; Paris Adult Theater I, 413 U. S. at 64; S.E.C. v. Wall Street Pub. Inst., Inc., 851 F.2d at 373; Bangor & Arrostook R.R. Co., 574 F. 2d at 1107.  
Since the regulation serves a substantial governmental interest, the Court must next consider the third and fourth prongs of the Central Hudson test, which, together, determine whether the regulation is “in proportion to that interest.”  These prongs ask whether the regulation directly advances the state interest, and whether the interest “could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech . . . .”  447 U.S. at 564.  As to the third prong, the interest, again, is to protect the integrity of the capital markets, and the overall health of the economy, by ensuring that investors make decisions based on full and accurate disclosure of all material information.  The regulations in issue serve that interest directly by prohibiting any public offering without registration, subject to narrow exemptions.[13]  See G. L. c. 110A, § 301.  As applied here, the regulation prohibits expression that, although not in the form of an express offer, tends to promote interest in investment, and thereby to invite offers to purchase.  Prohibition of such expression serves to limit solicitation of offers to those who have made full disclosure in connection with registration, and thereby directly serves the interests in issue.   
The fourth prong of the Central Hudson test is the most difficult to apply here.  Under that prong, the Court must determine whether the regulatory restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve the state interest; “if the Government could achieve its interests in a manner that does not restrict speech, or that restricts less speech, the Government must do so.”  Thompson v. Western States Med. Ctr., 535 U. S. 357, 371 (2002); see Lorillard Tobacco Co., 533 U. S. at 566.  The test is not, however, one of least restrictive means.  See Board of Trustees, State Univ. of N. Y., 492 U. S. at 477-478.  What is required, rather, is that “the regulation not ‘burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.’” Id. at 478, quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 799 (1989).  There must be “a ‘fit’ between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends,’. . . a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is ‘in proportion to the interest served.’”  Board of Trustees, 492 U. S. at 480, quoting Posadas de Puerto Rico Assocs. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U. S. 328, 341 (1986), and In re R. M. J., 455 U. S. 191, 203 (1982).  In evaluating the “fit,” the Court has been “loath to second-guess the Government’s judgment,” relying on the state’s judgment “so long as its judgment was reasonable.”  Board of Trustees, 492 U. S. at 479.  That deference serves to “provide the Legislative and Executive Branches needed leeway in a field (commercial speech) ‘traditionally subject to governmental regulation.’” Id. at 480, quoting Ohralik, 
436 U. S. at 455-456.  
The burden to prove the fit between the regulation and the interest served is on the regulator.  See Board of Trustees, 492 U. S. at 480.  At the stage of a preliminary injunction, however, the Court is not in the position of evaluating evidence and making ultimate findings as it would do after trial, but is rather predicting the likelihood that the regulator will be able to make the required showing.  In making that prediction, the Court can properly consider the longstanding and widespread recognition, as expressed in the cases cited supra, of the importance of regulation of the offering and sale of securities in protecting the health of the capital markets and of the economy.  
The Court also keeps in mind that the crux of the overall scheme established by both the state and federal securities laws is the requirement of registration.  Registration serves not to restrict speech, but to expand it, by ensuring that any public offer to sell securities is accompanied by full disclosure of all material information.  See Ralston Purina, 
346 U.S. at 124 n. 10 (quoting preamble to Federal Securities Act of 1933, “An Act to provide full and fair disclosure of the character of securities sold in interstate and foreign commerce  . . . and to prevent frauds in the sale thereof”); see also Wall Street Pub. Inst., 851 F.2d at 372.  Disclosure requirements “trench much more narrowly on an advertiser’s interests than do flat prohibitions on speech.”  Zauderer, 471 U. S. at 651.  For that reason, the high Court has held, “an advertiser’s rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State’s interest in preventing deception of consumers.”  Id.  See also Pharmaceutical Care Mgmt. Ass’n v. Rowe, 429 F.3d 294, 316 (1st Cir. 2005).   
The necessary corollary to the registration and disclosure requirement is the prohibition of public offering of unregistered securities.  Prohibitions on public offering inherently restrict speech.  But without such prohibitions it is difficult to imagine how a registration and disclosure system could operate with any degree of effectiveness.   See Kneeland, 280 Mass. at 377.  Here, the particular regulatory order in issue sanctions advertising unregistered securities to the public, including to a Massachusetts resident not shown to be an accredited investor.  The order fits directly within the longstanding norm of securities regulation that Courts have consistently accepted as permissible.  	
Bulldog emphasizes that its website did not provide a mechanism through which one could make an actual investment transaction, and that it has not and “would not” sell other than to investors who certify their accredited status.  That may be so, but the State is not required simply to take Bulldog’s word for it.  It is certainly reasonable to conclude that indiscriminate advertising to the general public tends to increase the likelihood of sales to ineligible persons, who may be persuaded to invest without the full information that registration would provide.  
Bulldog suggests that the State could achieve its objective with less burden on speech by monitoring actual investments, including requiring documentation of eligibility, subject to audit by regulatory officials, or even by requiring verification by regulatory officials prior to investment transactions.  How such a system would operate in practice is not apparent; at the least it would require that the issuer register with regulatory authorities, give notice of actual or proposed investments, and refrain from any transactions without registration and notice.  The result would seem to be more, rather than less, burden on speech.  A more fully developed record may lead to a different conclusion.  At this stage, however, the Court is of the view that the regulatory order in issue here is reasonably proportional to the interests to be served by the regulatory scheme, and accordingly that the plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on the merits of their First Amendment claim.  
As indicated supra, the plaintiffs’ supplemental memoranda adds a second theory, not identified in the complaint, that the Massachusetts regulations violate the Commerce Clause.  They invoke the so-called “dormant” aspect of the Commerce Clause, which prohibits state regulation that “discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby ‘impedes free private trade in the national marketplace.’” Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 287 (1997), quoting Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 437 (1980).  By analogy to cases addressing regulation of internet transmission of sexually explicit materials, plaintiffs argue that regulation of Bulldog’s website necessarily regulates commerce in other states.  See American Booksellers Foundation v. Dean, 342 F. 3d 96, 104 (2d Cir. 2003); PSINET, Inc. v. Chapman, 362 F. 3d 227, 240 (4th Cir. 2004).  Invoking the balancing test applied in those cases, they urge the Court to conclude that the burden on interstate commerce outweighs any benefit to Massachusetts residents from the regulation.  
Plaintiffs’ theory fails, because neither the regulation itself nor the Secretary’s application of it in the final order attempts to regulate Bulldog’s website in and of itself.  Rather, the final order is based on the combination of the website and the direct e-mail communication to a Massachusetts resident.  As indicated supra, the regulation, 950 C. M. R. § 14.02(b)(13), excludes internet offers not “directed toward any investor or group of investors in the Commonwealth.”  The regulation establishes a presumption that an offer is not directed to residents if it “contains indications” that it is “not being made in jurisdictions where it is not registered or appropriately exempted.”  The direct e-mail communication with Mr. Hickey rebutted that presumption.  
Regulation of e-mail sent into a state has been held not to implicate the dormant Commerce Clause, where federal law authorizes state regulation in the area.  See Beyond Systems, Inc. v. Keynetics, Inc., 422 F. Supp. 2d 523, 531-535 (D. Md. 2006), and cases cited.  Here, as in that case, Congress has expressly authorized state regulation in the field; 15 U. S. C. 
§ 77p(e) provides that state securities regulators “shall retain jurisdiction . . . to investigate and bring enforcement actions.”  See also Northeast Bancorp., Inc., v. Board of Governors, 472 U.S. 159, 174 (1985) (“When Congress so chooses, state actions which it plainly authorizes are invulnerable to constitutional attack under the Commerce Clause”).  	
Bulldog bases its argument not on the Secretary’s actual decision, but on recommended findings submitted to the hearing officer by the enforcement section, and on the theoretical possibility that at some time in the future the enforcement section would seek, and the Secretary would order, sanctions based on the website alone.  In this respect, what Bulldog seeks is essentially an advisory opinion, on a matter of federal constitutional law not involving freedom of speech.  Such relief is not available by means of a preliminary injunction.  	Bulldog has not established a likelihood of success on the merits of its claims.  The Court therefore has no occasion to address the other aspects of the test for a preliminary injunction.  The motion must be denied.  
CONCLUSION AND ORDER
For the reasons stated, the Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.  The Court will conduct a status conference at the earliest available date to set a schedule for future proceedings; counsel are directed to confer with each other and then contact the clerk to set a date.

[1]Opportunity Partners, L. P., Full Value Partners, L.P., Opportunity Income Plus Fund, 
L.P., Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., Full Value Advisors, LLC, Spar Advisors, LLC, Phillip Goldstein, Steven Samuels, Andrew Dakos, Rajeev Das, and Leonard Bloness.  
[2]The Court draws background information from the final order issued by the Secretary of State on October 17, 2007, as well as from the complaint, affidavits, and attached materials submitted by the plaintiffs in support of their motion.  
[3]Form D refers to a filing under Rule 506 of SEC Regulation D.  Under that rule, companies are permitted to raise unlimited funds through private offerings without registration, provided they follow certain requirements, including a restriction against general advertising or solicitation of offers to buy securities.  See 17 C. F. R. §§ 230.501-508.  Massachusetts regulation 950 C. M. R. § 14.402(B)(13)(I) requires compliance with that federal rule.  
[4]It appears, although the language of the complaint is less than clear on the point, that each is named solely in his official capacity.  
[5]The complaint does not include any prayer for monetary relief other than attorney’s fees.  The plaintiffs have recently moved for leave to file an amended complaint that would add claims for damages.  The Court denies that motion in a separate order issued this date.  
[6]The defendants have not controverted the assertions in the plaintiffs’ affidavits.  
[7]Although the Court is informed that Bulldog has brought a separate action for judicial review of the final order pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, § 14, Bulldog has not argued in this case that the final order is based on any error in interpretation or application of any state or federal statute or regulation, or on any erroneous factual finding.  The Court therefore takes as established the Secretary’s ruling that Bulldog’s operation of the website, combined with the e-mail communication to Brendan Hickey, violated G. L. c. 110A and regulations under it, as well as corresponding federal regulations.  	
[8]The defendants’ answers challenge Bloness’s standing, but not that of the list of parties referred to herein collectively as Bulldog.  Under these circumstances, the Court need not determine Bloness’s standing at this stage.  Mass. Redemption Coalition, Inc. v. Secretary of the Exec. Office of Envir. Affairs, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 67, 68 n.3 (2007), citing Mass. Teachers Ass’n v. Secretary of the Commonwealth, 384 Mass. 209, 214 (1981) (“[W]here at least one plaintiff has standing to raise issues before the court, the standing of other plaintiffs need not be addressed”).
[9]The only argument the plaintiffs offer under the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights is the suggestion that “Article XVI . . . can and should be interpreted to provide greater protection to free speech than the First Amendment.”  For this proposition the plaintiffs cite Mendoza v. Licensing Bd. of Fall River, 444 Mass. 188, 201 (2005), which applied Art. XVI to strike down a prohibition on nude dancing similar to one the United States Supreme Court had upheld under the First Amendment.  The plaintiffs do not cite any Massachusetts authority relating to regulation of commercial speech, or speech in any area otherwise analogous to that involved here.  Nor have they identified any case suggesting any other infirmity in the Massachusetts Securities Act under the Declaration of Rights.  The Supreme Judicial Court long ago rejected a challenge to the statute under Article 12.  See Kneeland v. Emerton, 280 Mass. 371, 383 (1932).  The Court notes further that the facts presented here appear to fall short of the element of threats, intimidation or coercion required for a claim under the state civil rights act.  See generally Haufler v. Zotos, 446 Mass. 489, 504-508 (2006), and cases cited. 
[10]The plaintiffs cite a line of cases applying First Amendment protections to publication of opinions by commentators and analysts who are not issuers of securities, and do not advise individual investors.  E.g. Lowe v. S. E. C., 472 U. S. 181, 210 (1985); Commodity Trend Serv. v. Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n, 149 F.3d 679, 682 (7th Cir. 1998); S. E. C. v. Wall St. Pub. Inst., Inc., 851 F.2d 365, 373 (D. C. Cir. 1988); Taucher v. Born, 53 F. Supp. 2d 464, 479-482 (D. C. 1999).  These cases are inapposite, since they do not involve advertising of securities.  Blount v. S. E. C., 61 F.3d 938, 939 (D. C. Cir. 1995), is similarly inapposite, involving regulation of campaign contributions.  
[11]A similar statement appears in the printable brochure that was accessible on the website.
[12]Disclosure that might be pertinent would include, for example, exactly what is meant by “a significant portion of our net worth,” so as to enable a potential investor in Bulldog’s funds to evaluate the extent to which the interests of its advisors really are aligned with those of the investor.  
[13]Bulldog identifies the regulatory interest as preventing sales to unaccredited investors, and argues that the regulation does not address that interest directly, since it applies to communications that are remote from any such sale.  This mistakes the interest at stake, which goes well beyond accredited investors.  The registration requirement ensures fully informed decision making by investors generally, and thereby serves the broad interest in the integrity of the capital markets.  Sales to accredited investors are a narrow exception to the registration requirement, under which unregistered securities may be sold privately, to a narrow and carefully selected category of purchasers, without the safeguards deemed necessary for the benefit of the public as a whole.  Cf. Stamm v. Barclays Bank of New York, 960 F. Supp. 724, 733 (S.D.N.Y. 1997); 15 U.S.C. § 77d(6).  Bulldog’s website communications were addressed to the general public, not limited to accredited investors, as is reflected in its e-mail exchange with Mr. Hickey, conducted without any prior effort to ascertain his accredited status.

Bulldog Investors General Partnership v. Secretary of the Commonwealth

Annotate this Case






457 Mass. 210 (2010)
BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP & others[1]
v.
SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
SJC-10589.
Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, Suffolk.
April 6, 2010.
July 2, 2010.
Present: MARSHALL, C.J., IRELAND, SPINA, COWIN, CORDY, & GANTS, JJ.
*211 Andrew Good (Philip G. Cormier with him) for the plaintiffs.
Pierce O. Cray, Assistant Attorney General (Peter W. Cassidy with him) for the defendant.
COWIN, J.
A hearing officer in the Securities Division (division) of the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) found that the plaintiffs violated G. L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (act), by offering unregistered securities to a Massachusetts resident via electronic mail (e-mail). The plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling, and a judge in the Superior Court affirmed. The plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the Commonwealth were insufficient to permit the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them, that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech, and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act. We conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process, that the constitutional claim is not properly before us, and that the Secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act. Unlike at common law, where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offeree's affirmative response would conclude a bargain, the act defines an "offer" more broadly to include the "solicitation of an offer." See G. L. c. 110A, § 401 (i) (2). Thus, the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a Massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities.
1. Facts and procedural history. We summarize the facts found by the hearing officer, supplemented with undisputed facts from the record. From approximately June 9, 2005, through January 5, 2007, Bulldog Investors General Partnership (Bulldog) operated an interactive Web site that provided information about investment products it offered for sale. Users could obtain more specific information about Bulldog's "hedge funds" by registering with the site.
On November 10, 2006, Brendan Hickey, a Massachusetts *212 resident, registered by providing Bulldog with his name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Steven Samuels, a Bulldog employee, responded to Hickey's registration with an e-mail message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs' hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog's partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs' investment philosophy and strategy. Samuels also invited Hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss Bulldog's funds in greater detail.
On January 31, 2007, the Secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs[2] alleging that Bulldog's Web site and e-mail contact with Hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration, in violation of the act. See G. L. c. 110A, § 301. In their answer, the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses (1) that the act and the Secretary's regulations violated the plaintiffs' right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (2) that in any event the Secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. The Secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 10.02(b)(8) (1993).
The Secretary moved for summary decision, arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs' constitutional claims. In response, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G. L. c. 12, § 11I, asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech.[3] The plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding *213 pending resolution of the First Amendment claim in the Superior Court; the hearing officer denied the request. She stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs' First Amendment right.[4]
The hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the Commonwealth. In addition, she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement. Finally, the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction. She recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a $25,000 fine.
The acting director of the Securities Division (acting director) adopted the hearing officer's recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions.[5] The plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting director's determination in the Superior Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings. See G. L. c. 30A, § 14; G. L. c. 110A, § 411. See also Standing Order 1-96(4) of the Rules of the Superior Court (2002) ("A claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings ..."). In a thoughtful memorandum of decision, a judge in the Superior Court[6] denied the motion and affirmed the acting director's ruling. The judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process. In addition, she held that, after having chosen to use the separate 42 *214 U.S.C. § 1983 action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, § 14. The plaintiffs appealed, and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.
2. Standard of review. Pursuant to G. L. c. 110A, § 411, "[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review." See G. L. c. 30A, § 14. We reverse the Secretary's decision only if it was "(a) [i]n violation of constitutional provisions"; "(b) [i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction" of the Secretary; "(c) [b]ased upon an error of law"; "(d) [m]ade upon unlawful procedure"; "(e) [u]nsupported by substantial evidence"; "(f) [u]nwarranted by facts found by the court ... where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact"; or "(g) [a]rbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." See G. L. c. 30A, § 14 (7).
3. Discussion. The plaintiffs contend that the Web site and the single e-mail message to Hickey were insufficient contacts with the Commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the Secretary. They claim that the act does not authorize the Secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of Massachusetts law.
The plaintiffs contend also that "[t]he Secretary's order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction," in violation of the First Amendment and art. 16. They argue in addition that their Web site and e-mail message did not constitute an "offer" within the meaning of the act. See G. L. c. 110A, § 401 (i) (2). They contend that the communication to Hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the e-mail message. In addition, they contend that Hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the Web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitation.
*215 The Secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case. He argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts. Furthermore, he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act. Additionally, the Secretary contends that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is waived, and that, even if not waived, the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them. Finally, the Secretary argues that the plaintiffs' communication with Hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the act's definition of an offer; he notes that the act's definition of the term "offer" is not limited to its common-law definition.
a. Personal jurisdiction. For a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts, there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be "consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the United States Constitution." Intech, Inc. v. Triple "C" Marine Salvage, Inc., 444 Mass. 122, 125 (2005), quoting Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 767 (1994). We analyze each requirement separately.
i. Statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction. In court proceedings, personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our long-arm statute, G. L. c. 223A, § 3, is satisfied. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, 447 Mass. 860, 862-863 (2006). By its terms, the long-arm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. See G. L. c. 223A, § 3.[7] However, the long-arm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction *216 over nonresidents. The text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceeding.
The act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the Commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are Federal "covered" securities. See G. L. c. 110A, § 301. The definition of "offer" includes not only offers that originate within the Commonwealth but also ones directed into the Commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed. See G. L. c. 110A, § 414 (c). The Secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the Commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred. See G. L. c. 110A, § 407 (a). He also has broad authority to remedy "a violation of any provision" of the act by "any person" by imposing cease and desist orders or fines. See G. L. c. 110A, § 407A (a). These provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect Massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions. These protections and the Secretary's authority to conduct investigations outside the Commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedings.
Furthermore, the act provides that, where personal jurisdiction "cannot otherwise be obtained in the Commonwealth," any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the Secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct. See G. L. c. 110A, § 414 (h). This authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred. Interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity. See Flemings v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000) ("If a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute *217 to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results").[8]
ii. Due process. "`The constitutional touchstone' of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process `remains whether the defendant established "minimum contacts" in the forum state.'" Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 772 (1994), quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985). The due process analysis entails three requirements. First, minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant "purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws." Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra, quoting Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1987). Second, the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendant's contacts with the forum. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Third, "the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'" Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra at 773, quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).
By contacting Hickey, the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in Massachusetts and invoked the protection of Massachusetts law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra (solicitation of business in Massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of Massachusetts law). Because the plaintiffs operated a Web site accessible in Massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by Massachusetts law to a Massachusetts resident, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in Massachusetts. *218 See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980) ("the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis ... is [whether] the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there").
At the time of their communication with Hickey, the plaintiffs were on notice that Hickey was a resident of Massachusetts. Additionally, the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into Massachusetts is unlawful. See G. L. c. 110A, §§ 301, 414 (a), (c). By soliciting purchases of their hedge funds, the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with Hickey. Therefore, it would be unfair "to escape having to account in [Massachusetts] for consequences that arise proximately from such activities." Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 473-474.
The plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, Inc., 447 Mass. 860, 861-862, 865 (2006); Droukas v. Divers Training Academy, Inc., 375 Mass. 149, 151, 157 (1978). These cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the long-arm statute. They did not address the due process question.
The second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case. It is undisputed that the Secretary's enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs' contacts with Massachusetts. Finally, exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice. In determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied, we weigh the Commonwealth's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the burden on the out-of-State party of litigating in Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 476-477. Massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of Massachusetts securities law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in Massachusetts, such inconvenience does not outweigh the Commonwealth's interest in enforcing its laws in a Massachusetts forum.
*219 The plaintiffs contend that, even if the Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over Bulldog, he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs. The Secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible. See Miller v. Miller, 448 Mass. 320, 325 (2007). Because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff, that burden has been met here.
In the administrative complaint, the Secretary alleged that Hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through e-mail. In their answer to the administrative complaint, each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via e-mail to Hickey. While some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication, the Secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits. See Walker v. Georgetown Housing Auth., 424 Mass. 671, 672 n.3 (1997).[9] Because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction, the Secretary's finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence.[10]
b. First Amendment claim. The plaintiffs argue that "[t]he Secretary's order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction." The Secretary contends that the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim has been waived, and that, even if it has not been waived, the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speech.
The plaintiffs initially asserted their First Amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint. The hearing *220 officer declined to rule on this issue; instead, she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court. The hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and, as such, beyond the authority of the Secretary to adjudicate. See Gurry v. Board of Public Accountancy, 394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985).
In response to the hearing officer's position, the plaintiffs litigated the First Amendment issue in a separate action in the Superior Court in which they asserted violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.[11] The plaintiffs did not raise the First Amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case, brought pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, § 14. They did plead the issue and litigate it in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. In these unusual circumstances, the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs' First Amendment claim.
c. Violation of the act. The Secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs' e-mail message to Hickey violated the act. The act defines an offer to include the "solicitation of an offer." See G. L. c. 110A, § 401 (i) (2). Thus, as stated, for the purposes of the act, the term "offer" is not limited to its common-law definition.[12] The e-mail message sent to Hickey, and the materials attached to it, contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs' hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog's partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs' investment philosophy and strategy. It is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in Bulldog's funds. Thus, the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities. See I & R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 62 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 455 (2004) (advertisements are usually considered requests for offers). See also 1 Williston, Contracts § 4:10, at 475 (4th ed. 2007).
*221 The plaintiffs contend that because Hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase Bulldog's securities, the e-mail communication cannot constitute an offer. Because in this context the term "offer" is not limited to its common-law definition, see G. L. c. 110A, § 401 (i) (2), it is not required that the plaintiffs' communication be such that Hickey's assent would have concluded a bargain. See note 12, supra.
Additionally, the disclaimers posted on the Web site do not defeat liability. In order to access certain parts of the Web site, users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the Web site does not constitute a solicitation and the Web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. However, the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their Web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer. The presence of a disclaimer asserting that the Web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive; the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs' communication with Hickey was an offer or a solicitation. Cf. LeMaitre v. Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., 452 Mass. 753, 756 (2008); Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 744 (2000). Here, as stated, the materials sent to Hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing Bulldog's securities. Most importantly, the e-mail message sent to Hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the Web site. For these reasons, the e-mail message sent to Hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act.
4. Conclusion. The Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs, and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct. Therefore, the decision of the Superior Court, affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine, was also correct.
Judgment affirmed.
NOTES
[1]  Opportunity Partners L.P.; Full Value Partners L.P.; Opportunity Income Plus Fund L.P.; Kimball & Winthrop, Inc.; Full Value Advisors, LLC; Spar Advisors, LLC; Phillip Goldstein; Steven Samuels; Andrew Dakos; and Rajeev Das.
[2]  Plaintiffs Opportunity Partners L.P.; Full Value Partners L.P.; and Opportunity Income Plus Fund L.P., are general partners of Bulldog Investors General Partnership (Bulldog). Plaintiff Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., is a managing general partner of Bulldog. Plaintiff Full Value Advisors, LLC, is the sole general partner of Full Value Partners L.P. Plaintiff Spar Advisors, LLC, is the sole general partner of Opportunity Income Plus Fund L.P. Plaintiffs Andrew Dakos, Rajeev Das, and Steven Samuels are principals of Bulldog. Plaintiff Phillip Goldstein is the president of Kimball & Winthrop, Inc., and a cofounder of Bulldog.
[3]  In the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action, the plaintiffs did not assert their contention that the exercise of personal jurisdiction by the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) violated due process.
[4]  From this point forward, the plaintiffs did not argue the First Amendment claim before the hearing officer. Instead, they asserted that claim without argument in their opposition to the motion for summary decision and stated that they agreed with the Secretary that a court should address that claim.
[5]  The acting director of the Securities Division stayed the imposition of sanctions until the Superior Court ruled on a motion for a preliminary injunction in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. A judge in the Superior Court later denied this motion.
[6]  The judge who decided the plaintiffs' G. L. c. 30A, § 14, action was the same judge who had earlier denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action.
[7]  General Laws c. 223A, § 3, authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a person when a cause of action arises from, inter alia, "the person's... transacting any business in this commonwealth; ... contracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth; ... causing tortious injury by an act or omission in this commonwealth; ... [or] causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by an act or omission outside this commonwealth if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in this commonwealth."
[8]  In other contexts, courts have recognized that substituted service provisions authorize personal jurisdiction. See Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 355-357 (1927) (statute considering operation of motor vehicle on public highway to be appointment of state official as agent for receiving process confers personal jurisdiction). See also LSI Indus., Inc. v. Hubbell Lighting, Inc., 232 F.3d 1369, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Renfro v. Adkins, 323 Ark. 288, 294 (1996); Cherokee v. Parsons, 944 So. 2d 886, 889-890 (Miss. 2006). The plaintiffs point out that the court in MFS Series Trust III v. Grainger, 96 P.3d 927, 934 (Utah 2004), interpreted the substituted service provision of Utah's securities act as authorizing service of process but not personal jurisdiction. We decline to follow this interpretation because it relies on cases analyzing whether a defendant possessed minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process, rather than whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized. See id.
[9]  The cases cited by the plaintiffs, stating that personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over corporate officers based on the contacts of their corporation, are also inapposite. Because Bulldog is a partnership, not a corporation, these principles are not applicable to this case. Even if these cases were applicable, they would be unavailing. In this case, personal jurisdiction was based on the admission each individual plaintiff made in the answer, not the contacts of the corporation. As stated, the Secretary was entitled to rely on this admission.
[10]  The plaintiffs assert that Hickey's inquiry to Bulldog was made at the request of a competitor with whom Bulldog was involved in a legal dispute and was a "sham." It is irrelevant whether Hickey contacted Bulldog without the intention of actually purchasing securities.
[11]  Judgment was entered in favor of the Secretary in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. The plaintiffs appealed that decision, and their appeal is now pending in the Appeals Court.
[12]  At common law, an offer is "the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain made in such a way as to justify the other person in understanding that his assent will conclude the agreement." I & R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 62 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 455 (2004), citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 24 (1981).

BULLDOG INVESTORS GENERAL PARTNERSHIP & others [FN1] vs. SECRETARY OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
SJC-10589.
April 6, 2010. – July 2, 2010.
Securities. Uniform Securities Act. Secretary of the Commonwealth. Jurisdiction, Personal, Nonresident, Long-arm statute. Due Process of Law, Jurisdiction over nonresident. Contract, Offer and acceptance.
CIVIL ACTION commenced in the Superior Court Department on November 15, 2007.
The case was heard by Judith Fabricant, J.
The Supreme Judicial Court on its own initiative transferred the case from the Appeals Court.
Andrew Good (Philip G. Cormier with him) for the plaintiffs.
Pierce O. Cray, Assistant Attorney General (Peter W. Cassidy with him) for the defendant.
Present: Marshall, C.J., Ireland, Spina, Cowin, Cordy, & Gants, JJ.
COWIN, J.
A hearing officer in the Securities Division (division) of the office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth (Secretary) found that the plaintiffs violated G.L. c. 110A, the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act (act), by offering unregistered securities to a Massachusetts resident via electronic mail (e-mail). The plaintiffs sought judicial review of this ruling, and a judge in the Superior Court affirmed. The plaintiffs contend that their contacts with the Commonwealth were insufficient to permit the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over them, that the act violates their constitutional right to free speech, and that the communication did not constitute an offer within the meaning of the act. We conclude that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consistent with due process, that the constitutional claim is not properly before us, and that the Secretary determined correctly that the plaintiffs violated the act. Unlike at common law, where the definition of an offer includes only communications to which an offeree’s affirmative response would conclude a bargain, the act defines an “offer” more broadly to include the “solicitation of an offer.” See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). Thus, the plaintiffs violated the act by sending to a Massachusetts resident materials soliciting an offer to purchase unregistered securities.
1. Facts and procedural history. We summarize the facts found by the hearing officer, supplemented with undisputed facts from the record. From approximately June 9, 2005, through January 5, 2007, Bulldog Investors General Partnership (Bulldog) operated an interactive Web site that provided information about investment products it offered for sale. Users could obtain more specific information about Bulldog’s “hedge funds” by registering with the site.
On November 10, 2006, Brendan Hickey, a Massachusetts resident, registered by providing Bulldog with his name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. Steven Samuels, a Bulldog employee, responded to Hickey’s registration with an e-mail message to which documents were attached that contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs’ hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog’s partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs’ investment philosophy and strategy. Samuels also invited Hickey to contact him by telephone to discuss Bulldog’s funds in greater detail.
On January 31, 2007, the Secretary filed an administrative complaint against the plaintiffs [FN2] alleging that Bulldog’s Web site and e-mail contact with Hickey constituted an offer of securities that were neither registered nor exempt from registration, in violation of the act. See G.L. c. 110A, § 301. In their answer, the plaintiffs denied violating the act and asserted as affirmative defenses (1) that the act and the Secretary’s regulations violated the plaintiffs’ right to free speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 16 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; and (2) that in any event the Secretary lacked personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs. The Secretary appointed a hearing officer pursuant to 950 Code Mass. Regs. § 10.02(b)(8) (1993).
The Secretary moved for summary decision, arguing that the hearing officer lacked the authority to decide the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims. In response, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Superior Court pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and G.L. c. 12, § 11I, asserting their constitutional claim regarding free speech. [FN3] The plaintiffs sought a stay of the administrative proceeding pending resolution of the First Amendment claim in the Superior Court; the hearing officer denied the request. She stated that the only issue before her was whether the plaintiffs violated the act and that she was required to make a finding regarding liability before a court could decide whether there had been an abridgement of the plaintiffs’ First Amendment right. [FN4]
The hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs had offered unregistered securities for sale in the Commonwealth. In addition, she determined that the plaintiffs did not qualify for various exemptions to the registration requirement. Finally, the hearing officer concluded that the plaintiffs were subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts because their violation of the act constituted a sufficient nexus to permit personal jurisdiction. She recommended the issuance of a cease and desist order and a $25,000 fine.
The acting director of the division (acting director) adopted the hearing officer’s recommended findings of fact and rulings of law and imposed the recommended sanctions. [FN5] The plaintiffs sought judicial review of the acting director’s determination in the Superior Court and moved for judgment on the pleadings. See G.L. c. 30A, § 14; G.L. c. 110A, § 411. See also Standing Order 1-96(4) of the Rules of the Superior Court (2002) (“A claim for judicial review shall be resolved through a motion for judgment on the pleadings …”). In a thoughtful memorandum of decision, a judge in the Superior Court [FN6] denied the motion and affirmed the acting director’s ruling. The judge concluded that personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs was both statutorily authorized and consonant with due process. In addition, she held that, after having chosen to use the separate 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action as the vehicle to obtain relief on their First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs could not raise that claim in the action pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14. The plaintiffs appealed and we transferred the case from the Appeals Court on our own motion.
2. Standard of review. Pursuant to G.L. c. 110A, § 411, “[a]ny person aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary in an adjudicatory proceeding may obtain judicial review.” See G.L. c. 30A, § 14. We reverse the Secretary’s decision only if it was “(a ) [i]n violation of constitutional provisions”; “(b ) [i]n excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction” of the Secretary; “(c )
[b]ased upon an error of law”; “(d ) [m]ade upon unlawful procedure”; “(e ) [u]nsupported by substantial evidence”; “(f ) [u]nwarranted by facts found by the court … where the court is constitutionally required to make independent findings of fact”; or “(g ) [a]rbitrary or capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” See G.L. c. 30A, § 14(7).
3. Discussion. The plaintiffs contend that the Web site and the single e-mail message to Hickey were insufficient contacts with the Commonwealth to subject them to personal jurisdiction before the Secretary. They claim that the act does not authorize the Secretary to subject nonresidents to administrative enforcement proceedings. Furthermore, they argue that exercising personal jurisdiction in this case violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the plaintiffs did not purposefully avail themselves of the benefits of Massachusetts law.
The plaintiffs contend also that “[t]he Secretary’s order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction,” in violation of the First Amendment and art. 16. They argue in addition that their Web site and e-mail message did not constitute an “offer” within the meaning of the act. See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). They contend that the communication to Hickey was not an offer because he could not have purchased securities merely by responding to the e-mail message. In addition, they contend that Hickey agreed to a disclaimer posted on the Web site stating that the information contained therein did not constitute a solicitation.
The Secretary responds that the broad enforcement powers granted him under the act authorized personal jurisdiction in this case. He argues also that his exercise of jurisdiction comported with due process because the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting activities in Massachusetts. Furthermore, he contends that they could have reasonably anticipated being the subject of an enforcement proceeding by virtue of their violation of the act. Additionally, the Secretary contends that the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim is waived, and that, even if not waived, the claim fails because there is no constitutional prohibition on requiring that a seller of securities disclose information about its products through registration before being allowed to offer or advertise them. Finally, the Secretary argues that the plaintiffs’ communication with Hickey constituted a solicitation that falls within the act’s definition of an offer; he notes that the act’s definition of the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition.
a. Personal jurisdiction. For a nonresident to be subject to personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts, there must be a statute authorizing jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction must be “consistent with basic due process requirements mandated by the United States Constitution.” Intech, Inc. v. Triple “C” Marine Salvage, Inc., 444 Mass. 122, 125 (2005), quoting Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 767 (1994). We analyze each requirement separately.
i. Statutory authorization of personal jurisdiction. In court proceedings, personal jurisdiction in Massachusetts over a nonresident is authorized when one of the provisions of our long-arm statute, G.L. c. 223A, § 3, is satisfied. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, 447 Mass. 860, 862-863 (2006). By its terms, the long-arm statute applies only to courts and cannot authorize an agency to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. See G.L. c. 223A, § 3. [FN7] However, the long-arm statute is not the only source for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresidents. The text and purposes of the act itself establish that it authorizes the Secretary to exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents in an administrative proceeding.
The act prohibits the offering or selling of unregistered securities in the Commonwealth unless the securities are exempt from the registration requirement or are Federal “covered” securities. See G.L. c. 110A, § 301. The definition of “offer” includes not only offers that originate within the Commonwealth but also ones directed into the Commonwealth and received at the place to which they are directed. See G.L. c. 110A, § 414 (c ). The Secretary possesses the authority to conduct investigations inside or outside the Commonwealth to determine if a violation has occurred. See G.L. c. 110A, § 407 (a ). He also has broad authority to remedy “a violation of any provision” of the act by “any person” by imposing cease and desist orders or fines. See G.L. c. 110A, § 407A (a ). These provisions establish that one of the purposes of the act is to protect Massachusetts residents from offers and sales of unregistered securities directed at them from other jurisdictions. These protections and the Secretary’s authority to conduct investigations outside the Commonwealth would be meaningless without authorization to subject nonresidents to enforcement proceedings.
Furthermore, the act provides that, where personal jurisdiction “cannot otherwise be obtained in the Commonwealth,” any nonresident who has violated the act is deemed to have appointed the Secretary as his agent to receive process in any noncriminal proceeding arising out of that conduct. See G.L. c. 110A, § 414 (h ). This authority to serve process would be ineffective in enforcing the act through administrative proceedings unless accompanied by the power to bring a respondent before a tribunal to adjudicate whether a violation occurred. Interpreting the statute to authorize service of process without authorizing personal jurisdiction would transform the substituted service provision into a nullity. See Flemings v. Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., 431 Mass. 374, 375-376 (2000) (“If a sensible construction is available, we shall not construe a statute to make a nullity of pertinent provisions or to produce absurd results”). [FN8]
ii. Due process. ” ‘The constitutional touchstone’ of the determination whether an exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with due process ‘remains whether the defendant established “minimum contacts” in the forum state.’ ” Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., 416 Mass. 763, 772 (1994), quoting Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474 (1985). The due process analysis entails three requirements. First, minimum contacts must arise from some act by which the defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.” Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra, quoting Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1987). Second, the claim must arise out of or relate to the defendant’s contacts with the forum. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Third, “the assertion of jurisdiction over the defendant must not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’ ” Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra at 773, quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945).
By contacting Hickey, the plaintiffs purposefully availed themselves of the privilege of conducting business activities in Massachusetts and invoked the protection of Massachusetts law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra (solicitation of business in Massachusetts invokes benefits and protection of Massachusetts law). Be
cause the plaintiffs operated a Web site accessible in Massachusetts and sent a solicitation that is prohibited by Massachusetts law to a Massachusetts resident, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to anticipate being held responsible in Massachusetts. See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980) (“the foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis … is [whether] the defendant’s conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there”).
At the time of their communication with Hickey, the plaintiffs were on notice that Hickey was a resident of Massachusetts. Additionally, the act placed the plaintiffs on notice that directing offers of unregistered securities into Massachusetts is unlawful. See G.L. c. 110A, §§ 301, 414 (a ), (c ). By soliciting purchases of their hedge funds, the plaintiffs sought to derive commercial benefit from their interaction with Hickey. Therefore, it would be unfair “to escape having to account in [Massachusetts] for consequences that arise proximately from such activities.” Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 473-474.
The plaintiffs suggest that we have ruled in prior cases that contacts more substantial than those existing here were insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction. See Roberts v. Legendary Marine Sales, Inc., 447 Mass. 860, 861-862, 865 (2006); Droukas v. Divers Training Academy, Inc., 375 Mass. 149, 151, 157 (1978). These cases are inapposite because they considered only whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized by the long-arm statute. They did not address the due process question.
The second and third prongs of the due process analysis are also satisfied in this case. It is undisputed that the Secretary’s enforcement proceedings arose out of the plaintiffs’ contacts with Massachusetts. Finally, exercising personal jurisdiction in these circumstances comports with fair play and substantial justice. In determining whether fair play and substantial justice are satisfied, we weigh the Commonwealth’s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the burden on the out-of-State party of litigating in Massachusetts, and the Commonwealth’s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief. See Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, supra at 476-477. Massachusetts has a strong interest in adjudicating violations of Massachusetts securities law. See Tatro v. Manor Care, Inc., supra. Although there may be some inconvenience to the plaintiffs in litigating in Massachusetts, such inconvenience does not outweigh the Commonwealth’s interest in enforcing its laws in a Massachusetts forum.
The plaintiffs contend that, even if the Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over Bulldog, he could not exert personal jurisdiction over the individual plaintiffs. The Secretary has the burden of proving facts sufficient to establish that personal jurisdiction is permissible. See Miller v. Miller, 448 Mass. 320, 325 (2007). Because the facts in the record are sufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over each individual plaintiff, that burden has been met here.
In the administrative complaint, the Secretary alleged that Hickey was sent advertising and offering materials through e-mail. In their answer to the administrative complaint, each individual plaintiff admitted that he provided information via e-mail to Hickey. While some of the individual plaintiffs later filed affidavits stating that they were not involved in sending this communication, the Secretary was entitled to credit the facts admitted in the answer rather than the affidavits. See Walker v. Georgetown Housing Auth., 424 Mass. 671, 672 n. 3 (1997). [FN9] Because each individual plaintiff admitted to facts sufficient to form a basis for personal jurisdiction, the Secretary’s finding that he possessed personal jurisdiction over all the plaintiffs is supported by substantial evidence. [FN10]
b. First Amendment claim. The plaintiffs argue that “[t]he Secretary’s order is an unconstitutional prior restraint on truthful, non-misleading speech that does not concern an illegal transaction.” The Secretary contends that the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim has been waived, and that, even if it has not been waived, the cease and desist order and the act itself do not violate the constitutional protection of freedom of speech.
The plaintiffs initially asserted their First Amendment defense in their answer to the administrative complaint. The hearing officer declined to rule on this issue; instead, she agreed that the constitutional defense should be decided by a court. The hearing officer apparently viewed the constitutional claim as a challenge to the enabling statute and, as such, beyond the authority of the Secretary to adjudicate. See Gurry v. Board of Public Accountancy, 394 Mass. 118, 126 (1985).
In response to the hearing officer’s position, the plaintiffs litigated the First Amendment issue in a separate action in the Superior Court in which they asserted violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. [FN11] The plaintiffs did not raise the First Amendment issue in their complaint for judicial review in the instant case, brought pursuant to G.L. c. 30A, § 14. They did plead the issue and litigate it in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. In these unusual circumstances, the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action is the proper forum for resolving the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim.
c. Violation of the act. The Secretary determined properly that the plaintiffs’ e-mail message to Hickey violated the act. The act defines an offer to include the “solicitation of an offer.” See G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2). Thus, as stated, for the purposes of the act, the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition. [FN12] The e-mail message sent to Hickey, and the materials attached to it, contained detailed information regarding the performance of the plaintiffs’ hedge funds, the returns the funds had earned, background information on Bulldog’s partners, news articles about the funds, and a description of the plaintiffs’ investment philosophy and strategy. It is clear that these materials were designed to stimulate interest in Bulldog’s funds. Thus, the communication constituted a solicitation of an offer to buy unregistered securities. See I & R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 62 Mass.App.Ct. 452, 455 (2004) (advertisements are usually considered requests for offers). See also 1 Williston, Contracts § 4:10, at 475 (4th ed.2007).
The plaintiffs contend that because Hickey would have needed to take additional steps before being permitted to purchase Bulldog’s securities, the e-mail communication cannot constitute an offer. Because in this context the term “offer” is not limited to its common-law definition, see G.L. c. 110A, § 401 (i ) (2), it is not required that the plaintiffs’ communication be such that Hickey’s assent would have concluded a bargain. See note 12, supra.
Additionally, the disclaimers posted on the Web site do not defeat liability. In order to access certain parts of the Web site, users are required to acknowledge disclaimers stating that the Web site does not constitute a solicitation and the Web site cannot be used for the purpose of an offer or solicitation in any circumstances where such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful. However, the plaintiffs cannot escape liability for offering unregistered securities merely by stating to the users of their Web site that their conduct does not constitute an offer. The presence of a disclaimer asserting
that the Web site was not an offer or a solicitation is not dispositive; the disclaimer is only one factor in determining whether the plaintiffs’ communication with Hickey was an offer or a solicitation. Cf. LeMaitre v. Massachusetts Turnpike Auth., 452 Mass. 753, 756 (2008); Theos & Sons, Inc. v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 431 Mass. 736, 744 (2000). Here, as stated, the materials sent to Hickey were designed to stimulate interest in purchasing Bulldog’s securities. Most importantly, the e-mail message sent to Hickey and the attachments therein did not contain the disclaimer that was posted on the Web site. For these reasons, the e-mail message sent to Hickey was an offer within the meaning of the act.
4. Conclusion. The Secretary possessed personal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs, and his determination that the plaintiffs violated the act was correct. Therefore, the decision of the Superior Court, affirming the issuance of the cease and desist order and the imposition of the fine, was also correct.
Judgment affirmed.

General Laws c. 223A, § 3, authorizes a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a person when a cause of action arises from, inter alia, “the person’s … transacting any business in this commonwealth … contracting to supply services or things in this commonwealth … causing tortious injury by an act or omission in this commonwealth … [or] causing tortious injury in this commonwealth by an act or omission outside this commonwealth if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered, in this commonwealth.”






 
FN8. In other contexts, courts have recognized that substituted service provisions authorize personal jurisdiction. See Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 355-357 (1927) (statute considering operation of motor vehicle on public highway to be appointment of state official as agent for receiving process confers personal jurisdiction). See also LSI Indus., Inc. v. Hubbell Lighting, Inc., 232 F.3d 1369, 1371 (Fed.Cir.2000); Renfro v. Adkins, 323 Ark. 288, 294 (1996); Cherokee v. Parsons, 944 So.2d 886, 889-890 (Miss.2006). The plaintiffs point out that the court in MFS Series Trust III v. Grainger, 96 P.3d 927, 934 (Utah 2004), interpreted the substituted service provision of Utah’s securities act as authorizing service of process but not personal jurisdiction. We decline to follow this interpretation because it relies on cases analyzing whether a defendant possessed minimum contacts sufficient to satisfy due process, rather than whether personal jurisdiction was statutorily authorized. See id.






 
FN9. The cases cited by the plaintiffs, stating that personal jurisdiction cannot be exercised over corporate officers based on the contacts of their corporation, are also inapposite. Because Bulldog is a partnership, not a corporation, these principles are not applicable to this case. Even if these cases were applicable, they would be unavailing. In this case, personal






 
jurisdiction was based on the admission each individual plaintiff made in the answer, not the contacts of the corporation. As stated, the Secretary was entitled to rely on this admission.






 
FN10. The plaintiffs assert that Hickey’s inquiry to Bulldog was made at the request of a competitor with whom Bulldog was involved in a legal dispute and was a “sham.” It is irrelevant whether Hickey contacted Bulldog without the intention of actually purchasing securities.






 
FN11. Judgment was entered in favor of the Secretary in the 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action. The plaintiffs appealed that decision, and their appeal is now pending in the Appeals Court.






 
FN12. At common law, an offer is “the manifestation of willingness to enter into a bargain made in such a way as to justify the other person in understanding that his assent will conclude the agreement.” I & R Mechanical, Inc. v. Hazelton Mfg. Co., 62 Mass.App.Ct. 452, 455 (2004), citing Restatement (Second) of
Contracts § 24 (1981).
