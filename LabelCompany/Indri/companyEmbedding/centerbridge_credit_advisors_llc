"No problem at all"
No problem at all, very helpful.



    

Andrew Powell





"National Debt Relief has been so very …"
National Debt Relief has been so very helpful. They are thorough with the explanation of their process and expectations.  I actually feel like my goal will be met instead of feeling hopeless.  If I have any questions or concerns, they respond promptly and always with reassurances.



    

Michelle Neal





"The best"
Omg, they are the best.  I have been with National debt relief for 5mos and they settled two of my debts, because of them, i am one step closer to be coming debt free.

"Very nice people and informative"

"Oh what a blessing National Debt Relief …"
Oh what a blessing National Debt Relief is to me. From the first conversation up until this time they have set me free from sleepless nights of "how am I going to make it". Don't hesitate any longer. Try them. You will be glad you did.  Thank you National Debt Relief.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.

The Debt Calculator
This is a free debt analysis that starts with your monthly income before taxes and then asks for some common expenses like your monthly rent or mortgage payment, your car payment, and debt payments.

Centerbridge Partners is a multi-strategy private investment firm focused on leveraged buyouts and distressed securities.
The firm manages over $25 billion of assets[1] and is based in New York City, with an additional office in London. The firm invests in both control (private equity and public debt with a "loan-to-own" strategy) and non-control (public market debt, public market equities, and other publicly traded securities) opportunities.
The firm [2] was founded in 2005 by Jeffrey Aronson and Mark Gallogly. Aronson had previously been the head of distressed securities and had founded the leveraged loan business at Angelo, Gordon & Co., which he had joined in 1989 from L.F. Rothschild & Co. Gallogly was formerly a senior managing director and head of private equity investments at the Blackstone Group from 2003 until his departure. At Blackstone, Gallogly was heavily involved in the firm's investments in New Skies Satellites and Sirius Satellite Radio among others and had joined the firm in 1989 from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, where he worked in acquisition finance.
In September 2006, the firm raised its debut fund with $3.2 billion of investor commitments to focus on control investments in distressed securities as well as leveraged buyout transactions.[3][4] The firm also raised a $2 billion noncontrol, activist-oriented credit trading fund known as Centerbridge Special Credit Partners through 2009 and 2010.[5] In 2010, the firm announced plans to begin marketing a second investment fund with a target of $3.75 billion of investor commitments.[6] In 2011, the firm closed its second flagship fund, Centerbridge Partners II, on $4.4 billion, including a commitment from the GP.[7] This was followed by a closing of its $2bn second Special Credit Partners fund in March 2012.[2]
In 2010, Centerbridge won control of Extended Stay Hotels, a company that Gallogly had been involved with at Blackstone.[8]
On 24 September 2010, Centerbridge Capital Partners announced acquisition of 'GMAC Commercial Finance', a subsidiary of Ally Financial.[9]
In 2012, Centerbridge acquired P. F. Chang's China Bistro, a chain of Chinese casual dining restaurants.[10]
On 22 January 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced its agreement to buy Senvion SE from Indian wind turbine manufacturer Suzlon.[11]
On 24 March 2015, Centerbridge Partners announced that they reached an agreement to acquire Great Wolf Resorts, the world's largest chain of indoor water park resorts for $1.35 billion.[12]

National Debt Relief has been so very helpful. They are thorough with the explanation of their process and expectations.  I actually feel like my goal will be met instead of feeling hopeless.  If I have any questions or concerns, they respond promptly and always with reassurances.

"Oh what a blessing National Debt Relief …"
Oh what a blessing National Debt Relief is to me. From the first conversation up until this time they have set me free from sleepless nights of "how am I going to make it". Don't hesitate any longer. Try them. You will be glad you did.  Thank you National Debt Relief.

"Spare of the moment to decide to go to …"
Spare of the moment to decide to go to them, entire transaction was explained and good to go in a couple hours.  All was put into motion before the next billing cycle of creditors due date.  I would recommend this one over the many I receive by mail, they didn't contact me I went to them and they listened.  Staff is very courteous and considerate, understanding you as a person and in my case didn't choose to be in this financial position but bad stuff happens.
