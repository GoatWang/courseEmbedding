Kevin J Kenny's Experience
Title: Commissioner
               Company: Hampton Bays Fire Department
Job Details
               Prior to 1930 Hampton Bays or Good Ground as it was known as back then, had to rely on Southampton Fire Department for fire protection. After a serious fire on Lynn Ave, many residents agreed that Hampton Bays needed it's own fire company. At that time there were nearly 800 families living here year round. On May 28, 1930 the Hampton Bays Fire Company, Inc. was organized and chartered by the State of New York. Thirty-eight men, with last names now familiar to Hampton Bays, such as Bangston, Sinclair, Langsdorf, Jacobs, Meschutt, Zarro, Carter and Penny, just to name a few, made up this newly formed fire company. John Carter was elected as the company's first chief and served in that position for 14 years. Since then, thirty-three others have served in the position of chief. Serving on the first Board of Fire Commissioners were Jacob Rieger, Fred Phillips and Leo Ash. In late 1930 the firehouse was built on its present site. The first equipment housed in the new firehouse was a 1929 Chevrolet with a side mounted two-hundred-fifty gallon per minute pump and a 1928 Cadillac truck, which was converted to a hose truck. Soon after, a 1930 Seagrave with a front mounted five hundred gallon per minute pump was added to the fleet. In 1943 this same truck was destroyed by a raging brush fire in Shinnecock Hills. The bell from this truck was refurbished and is now displayed in the firehouse. During the war, the department experienced a manpower shortage, as did many east end communities. It was not unusual to see a fire truck pull up to the Hampton Bays School to pickup several teenaged students to assist with an alarm. Over the years there have been many many incidents, too many to recount them all, but possibly the most spectacular fire in the history of Hampton Bays was the King Industries fire in 1957. Firemen from Hampton Bays, East Quogue and Southampton fought the blaze for more than twenty-four hours. The night after extinguishing the King Industries fire, those same members were called out again to fight a fire at the Canoe Place Inn. The Board of Fire Commissioners have been dedicated in providing the residents of Hampton Bays with the most up-to-date Fire Fighting and Rescue equipment and apparatus. The Department currently maintains five "Class A" Pumpers (each with the capacity to pump a minimum of 1500 gallons of water per minute when needed), which are three engines, a 100 ft Tower Ladder and a 3,000 Gallon Tanker, a Rescue/Light Truck, two Brush Trucks, two Fire Police Units, Ice Rescue Hovercraft, a deuce and a half, and in addition, the Department has a Technical Rescue Unit and a Dive & Water Rescue Unit. Currently, the Department operates out of two locations in Hampton Bays - the Main Firehouse on Montauk Highway and Station 1 at 106 Ponquogue Avenue, which was opened in 2008. The Hampton Bays Fire Department has grown to almost 100 All Volunteer members. They respond to over 400 alarms per year and train hundreds of hours per year. Members also take time throughout the year to visit the local schools to talk about Fire Safety and Prevention. The times may have changed, but the community spirit and dedication to duty still exists. The Volunteer Fire Department is still a vital part of this community and its members are dedicated to protecting it from the threat of fire and other emergencies. The Board of Fire Commissioners, Chiefs, Officers, & Men & Women of the Hampton Bays Fire Company wish to remind the community that the best protection from the threat of fire is prevention and that "there is no honor in fighting a fire that could have been prevented through education".

Cardiovascular Systems Names Kevin J. Kenny Executive Vice President 
      of Sales and Marketing




Former Medtronic Executive Brings More Than 20 Years of Senior 
      Management Experience to CSI






May 09, 2011 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) (Nasdaq: CSII) has named Kevin J. 
      Kenny executive vice president of sales and marketing, a new position, 
      effective today. Kenny will oversee all sales and marketing functions 
      with the goal of building on the marketplace success CSI has achieved 
      since its first-generation Diamondback 360° product was launched in late 
      2007.
    


      “Kevin has extensive executive experience in sales and marketing, 
      managing large commercial organizations and delivering results in both 
      market growth and share,” said David L. Martin, president and chief 
      executive officer for Cardiovascular Systems. “We’re excited to have him 
      play a leading role in commercializing our new Stealth 360°TM 
      Orbital PAD System and driving physician adoption of our technology as 
      the front-line treatment for peripheral arterial disease. We have 
      established scientific proof of our orbital PAD systems’ utility, and we 
      are introducing an easy-to-use product with the Stealth 360°. Adding 
      Kevin to our team at this stage will raise CSI to a new level of growth 
      and leadership in the vascular intervention market.”
    

      Kenny brings more than 20 years of leadership experience to CSI. Prior 
      to CSI, he held several positions at Medtronic, most recently executive 
      consultant-special projects for Medtronic Spine and Biologics, and prior 
      to that, vice president of U.S. sales for that division, which is 
      Medtronic’s second-largest division. Kenny joined the Spine and 
      Biologics division in 2002 and held regional and national sales 
      positions with increasing responsibilities. Earlier, Kenny served as 
      vice president of U.S. sales for Bausch and Lomb, as well as various 
      sales leadership roles with B.Braun/McGaw. Kenny received a bachelor’s 
      degree in business administration from California State University in 
      Sacramento.
    

      Kenny added, “I look forward to leveraging my medical device industry 
      experience to position CSI for accelerated growth. I am excited about 
      CSI’s products, commitment to innovation and research, and growth 
      prospects.”
    

About Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.Cardiovascular Systems, 
      Inc., based in St. Paul, Minn., is a medical device company focused on 
      developing and commercializing innovative solutions for treating 
      vascular and coronary disease. The company’s Stealth 360°™, Diamondback 
      360® and Diamondback Predator 360® Orbital PAD 
      Systems treat calcified and fibrotic plaque in arterial vessels 
      throughout the leg in a few minutes of treatment time, and address many 
      of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and 
      pharmacological treatment alternatives. The U.S. FDA granted 510(k) 
      clearance for the use of the Diamondback 360° in August 2007 and for the 
      Stealth 360° in March 2011. To date, more than 46,000 PAD procedures 
      have been performed using the Diamondback 360° in leading institutions 
      across the United States.
    

      CSI has also commenced its ORBIT II Investigational Device Exemption 
      clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its 
      Diamondback 360° System in treating coronary arteries. The coronary 
      system is under clinical investigation and is currently not commercially 
      available in the United States.

Fruit Of The Month
Local PeachesTraditional Peaches, Doughnut Peaches, and White Peaches are all LOCALLY grown! 
Nothing says summer time like the sweet, juicy and refreshing flavors of a peach.  Keany is proud to offer three delicious varieties of peaches this month.  The traditional peach is the staple fruit of the summer and can be used in most summer dishes whether they are hot or cold.  For a sweeter treat, try the doughnut peach which is known for its crisp almond undertones or the white peach which is less acidic so the natural sweet and tart flavor really shines.
