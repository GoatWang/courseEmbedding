The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - FDIC

What is the 'Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - FDIC'
  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is the U.S. corporation insuring deposits in the United States against bank failure. The FDIC was created in 1933 to maintain public confidence and encourage stability in the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. The FDIC insures deposits of up to $250,000 per institution, as of 2016, as long as the bank is a member firm.Before opening an account with a financial institution, be sure to confirm that it is FDIC insured.

                                                    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ...                                             







BREAKING DOWN 'Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - FDIC'
The main purpose of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is to prevent the kind of "run on the bank" scenarios that devastated many banks during the Great Depression. Before FDIC, there was no guarantee beyond the bank's own stability. This meant that only those who were first to withdraw their money from a troubled bank would get it; those who waited stood the risk of losing their life savings overnight. As fear of bank closures started to spread, a small trickle of worried customers looking to withdraw money would soon turn into a stampede until the bank was unable to meet the withdrawal requests.The FDIC DifferenceSince practically all banks and thrifts now offer FDIC coverage, the customers have no reason to panic even if the institution falls on hard times. In case of bank failure, the FDIC covers deposits up to $250,000, which is more than enough for the majority of customers. Thus, no run on the bank is triggered, and the bank has a fighting chance to sort out its troubles under controlled circumstances.What Accounts Are Covered?Checking accounts, savings accounts,  Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and   money market accounts are generally 100% covered by FDIC. Some trust accounts and  Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are covered, but only the parts that fit the type of accounts listed above. FDIC insurance does not cover any type of   investment product, such as mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks or bonds. The contents of safe-deposit boxes are not included in FDIC coverage either. Cashier's checks and money orders issued by the failed bank remain fully covered by FDIC.Contacting FDICA customer can file a claim with FDIC as early as the day after a bank or thrift folds. The claim can be filed online through the FDIC website. A phone hotline allows bank customers to get personalized assistance at no cost, by calling 877-275-3342 (1-877-ASKFDIC).Note that FDIC only insures against bank failures. Instances of fraud, theft and similar loss are handled by the bank.

How the FDIC backs up your bank deposits -- to $250,000
By Marcie Geffner • Bankrate.com


Did you know that the amount of money in your bank account matters in the unlikely event your bank fails?While your deposits are insured for up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC, that doesn't mean every account at a particular bank is covered for that amount. The way you structure your accounts could put you at risk. But there also are ways to set up accounts so you're insured for far more than $250,000."A lot of consumers don't understand what the limits are," says Thomas Healy, deputy chief compliance officer at Ally Bank. "People think it's $250,000. Period."MASTERING YOUR MONEY: Make this the starting point on your money road map.What is FDIC insurance?Since it was established in 1933, the FDIC has provided insurance on your money in case your bank goes belly up.The insurance covers checking, savings and money market accounts, and certificates of deposit, or CDs. It also covers other types of accounts, such as individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, and trust accounts.All state and nationally chartered banks must carry the insurance, says FDIC spokeswoman LaJuan Williams-Young.Why the government created the FDICOn June 16, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933, which established the FDIC, among other things. The FDIC was created in response to thousands of bank failures during the early years of the Great Depression that resulted in about $1.3 billion in losses to depositors.The act was designed "to raise the confidence of the U.S. public in the banking system by alleviating the disruptions caused by bank failures and bank runs," according to the FDIC.FDIC insurance doesn't cover investment products, such as mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, bonds or the contents of your safe-deposit box.If your money is on deposit at a federally chartered credit union or the vast majority of state-chartered ones, you have coverage through the National Credit Union Administration, or NCUA, which operates similarly to the FDIC.FDIC insurance coverage limitsRATE SEARCH: Looking for another place to stash your cash? Let Bankrate.com help you find a great local savings account today.Yes, you have coverage up to $250,000, but that doesn't mean every account you have is insured for that much. Instead, coverage is based on how the accounts are owned.Single accountsThe maximum amount of coverage for single accounts at one bank is $250,000. All single accounts at the same bank are added together. Let's look at the example of an account holder we'll call Mark.Mark's accountsSavings$100,000CD$150,000Checking$50,000  Total$300,000Amount insured$250,000Amount uninsured$50,000Joint accountsEach co-owner receives $250,000 in insurance for each account, plus $250,000 in insurance for individual accounts at a bank. Let's look at an example of married account holders we'll call Ron and Pat.Ron and Pat's accountsJoint savings$500,000Ron's CD$250,000Pat's savings$250,000  Total$1 millionAmount insured$1 millionYou can boost your coverage limits higher by opening other types of accounts within the same bank. Other ownership categories include:Certain retirement accounts.Revocable trusts.Irrevocable trusts.Employee benefit plan accounts.Corporation, partnership and unincorporated association accounts.Government accounts."It's very easy as an individual to have $1 million (insured) -- if not more, in some cases -- at specific institutions," Healy says.Consumers need to keep in mind that their accounts are still subject to FDIC limits even if they have accounts at different branches of the same bank, Healy says. But if they have accounts at two different banks, the insurance limits apply at each bank individually. They aren't lumped together.More on insurance coverageThe FDIC offers multiple ways for depositors to find out how to set up their accounts to maximize their protection:A toll-free consumer hotline, 1 (877) ASK-FDIC or 1 (877) 275-3342, allows depositors to talk to a live person at no cost.An online customer assistance form allows depositors to ask questions or submit complaints by email.An automated interactive online service, the Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator, also known as "EDIE," helps depositors analyze whether accounts are properly set up.Depositors can ask questions or submit complaints by mail to: FDIC, Attn: Deposit Insurance Outreach, 550 17th St. NW, Washington, D.C., 20429-9990.Only bank failures are coveredFDIC insurance applies only if your bank fails. And after a few volatile years, bank failures have again become rare. Just a handful of banks have been shuttered in 2015.That's a huge improvement. From 2008 to 2012, the FDIC reported 465 bank failures. The largest was Washington Mutual, which had $307 billion in assets when it failed in 2008. The government blamed the failure on WaMu's high-risk lending strategy.When a bank fails, the FDIC must collect and sell the assets of the failed bank and settle its debts. If your bank goes bust, the FDIC will typically reimburse your insured deposits the next business day, says Williams-Young.Banks cover you in case of fraudIt's a different story if your bank account is hacked or someone writes a bogus check and drains your account."It's only for bank failure that FDIC insurance covers the account," Williams-Young says.Instead, it's the banks themselves that are covering your losses if someone steals your money, says Doug Johnson, senior vice president of payments and cybersecurity policy for the American Bankers Association, or ABA. "Banks as a matter of policy fully reimburse customers for fraud on their accounts."Banks can purchase insurance to protect against losses from fraud, and also have reserves to cover such losses, Johnson says.A study by the ABA found that in 2012, fraud against deposit accounts cost banks $1.74 billion, but banks prevented $13 billion in fraud, Johnson says.If you suffer a loss due to fraud, you should report it to your bank as soon as possible so it can be investigated. "We're getting pretty good at doing the investigations," he says.By law, banks have to give customers provisional credit within 10 days. "They generally give provisional credit much sooner, or full credit," Johnson says.If you’re a victim of fraud, grab a free copy of your credit report at myBankrate.

FDIC Issues Final Guidance Regarding Deposit Advance Products







               FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
               November 21, 2013
             




                 Media Contact:

				Greg Hernandez (202) 898-6984
				Cell: (202) 340-4922
				Email: ghernandez@fdic.gov







The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) today issued final supervisory guidance to FDIC-supervised financial institutions that offer or may consider offering deposit advance products.  The guidance is intended to ensure that banks are aware of the credit, reputational, operational and compliance risks associated with deposit advance products and have taken steps to mitigate these risks effectively.  This guidance supplements the FDIC's existing guidance on payday loans and subprime lending, as well as the FDIC's guidelines on small dollar loans.
FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg said, "The final supervisory guidance released today aims to alert financial institutions to the risks posed by certain deposit advance products and to encourage institutions to meet the demand for small-dollar loans through affordable products that are prudently underwritten and designed."
Deposit advance products are a type of small-dollar, short-term credit product that some depository institutions offer to customers maintaining a deposit account, reloadable prepaid card, or similar deposit-related vehicle.  The customer takes out a loan, which is to be repaid from the proceeds of their next direct deposit.  Deposit advance products share a number of characteristics seen in traditional payday loans, including high fees; short, lump-sum repayment terms; and inadequate attention to the consumer's ability to repay.  As such, banks need to be aware that deposit advance products can pose a variety of credit, reputational, operational, compliance and other risks.
The FDIC recognizes the demand for responsible small-dollar credit products for consumers that are underwritten with attention to the customer's ability to repay the loan without needing to borrow repeatedly to meet necessary expenses.  The FDIC's 2007 Affordable Small-Dollar Loan Guidelines encourage insured institutions to offer small-dollar loan products that have affordable, reasonable interest rates with no or low fees and payments that reduce the principal balance of the loan.  If structured properly, small-dollar loans can provide a safe and affordable means for borrowers to transition away from reliance on high-cost debt products.  A number of banks are currently offering such small-dollar loans to their customers.  The FDIC encourages banks to continue to offer these products, consistent with safety and soundness and other supervisory considerations.  The FDIC also encourages banks to develop new or innovative programs to effectively meet the need for small-dollar credit.

Congress created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933 to restore public confidence in the nation's banking system. The FDIC insures deposits at the nation's 6,940 banks and savings associations, and it promotes the safety and soundness of these institutions by identifying, monitoring and addressing risks to which they are exposed. The FDIC receives no federal tax dollars — insured financial institutions fund its operations.

In his first fireside chat, President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the American people, “it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than it is to keep it under the mattress.”
That same year, the government established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., or FDIC, as part of reform designed to improve public confidence in the U.S. financial system and encourage people to put their money in banks that could lend it out and boost the economy.
This program insures deposits up to $250,000 per account holder in member banks in case the bank fails.

History of the FDIC
In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933 in response to the banking crisis that occurred in the wake of the stock market’s crash in 1929.
Afraid of losing all their savings, bank customers withdrew their money from banks. When these withdrawals happened in waves, people drained their bank’s reserves and forced it to liquidate loans, sell assets and close its doors. Each bank closure lowered the public’s confidence in the economy and the banking system.
The Banking Act of 1933 established guidelines for banks that improved their stability. As part of this reform, the government established the FDIC, or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
However, this provision was highly controversial, as large banks believed it would force them to subsidize small, rural banks. It prevailed, becoming effective the following year to insure deposits up to $2,500. This limit increased over time, eventually reaching the $250,000 limit allowed today.

How the FDIC works
FDIC member banks pay annual dues that fund the program. When a bank cannot meet its financial obligations, which happens when account holders remove enough money to lower the bank’s reserves too much or when the bank’s credit rating drops so low that other banks won’t lend it money, the bank fails.
This is when the FDIC steps in to make sure depositors don’t lose their money. However, like any insurance policy, the FDIC has restrictions on the types of accounts covered and which events qualify.

Covered accounts
The FDIC protects deposits made by account holders, and for this reason, only certain types of accounts have this protection. It insures 100% of the amount in the following accounts (up to the $250,000 limit):

Checking accounts.
Savings accounts.
Certificates of deposit.
Money market accounts.

Although some member banks offer additional services and investment products, the FDIC does not protect the money in these accounts. The following accounts are not FDIC-insured:

Annuities.
Bonds.
Life insurance policies.
Municipal securities.
Mutual funds.
Stocks.
U.S. Treasury bills, bonds or notes.

The FDIC also excludes items and documents stored in safe deposit boxes. Account holders need to check their homeowner’s insurance policies or with their banks to find out what private insurance coverage protects these items.
However, it does honor cashier’s checks and money orders issued by a failed bank.

Covered events
The FDIC pays out a benefit only when a bank fails and closes its doors. Sometimes, struggling banks sell their assets and accounts to larger banks as a way to avoid closing.
When this happens, account holders still have access to their money. They just receive debit cards and bank statements with different logos. The FDIC also does not cover fraud and identity theft.
When account holders lose money because of fraud or identity theft, the bank shoulders the responsibility for the problem.

Coverage limits
Perhaps the most confusing aspect of the FDIC is the coverage limit. Individuals who have less than $250,000 receive the full amount they have in the account if the bank fails.
Those who have more than $250,000 in accounts need to pay attention to the types of accounts and their ownership categories to maximize their protection.
For example, take a couple with $500,000 in savings. If they keep all this money in a single account and the bank holding this account fails, they receive $250,000 of the money and lose the rest.
To avoid this problem, they can deposit the money in accounts at different banks or that fall under different ownership categories.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)











Overview: 

		The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the federal government responsible for insuring deposits made by individuals and companies in banks and other thrift institutions. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000. The agency also identifies and monitors risks to its deposit insurance funds and tries to limit the effects on the U.S. economy if a bank of thrift institution should fail. The FDIC is funded through premiums paid by banks and thrift institutions to pay for deposit coverage and from interest the agency earns on U.S. Treasury securities. Recent bank failures stemming from the mortgage crisis have drawn attention to the FDIC as it has tried to reimburse depositors. It also has come under criticism from those on both the left and right for its work, which has included restrictions that kept retail giant Walmart from getting into the banking business.

History: 
	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) was created in 1933 as a way to mitigate the damage caused by thousands of bank failures stemming from the stock market crash of 1929 and other risky investments. Nervous investors, worried about losing their life savings, began to withdraw money from banks all across the nation. In many cases, this led to bank failure, as institutions simply ran out of money. 

	 

	To help calm fears and bring some stability, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a four-day bank holiday on March 6, 1933, during which U.S. banks were shut down to undergo inspections. Then, the President addressed the banking crisis in a speech of March 12, 1933 to reassure worried Americans. On June 16, President Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933 (also known as the Glass-Steagall Act), which helped to form the FDIC, which was placed under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve.

	 

	The FDIC began extending its coverage for deposits on January 1, 1934. On July 5, 1934, Lydia Lobsiger received the first-ever federal deposit insurance disbursement, after the Fon Du Lac State Bank, in East Peoria, Illinois, failed. 

	 

	To avert any future banking catastrophes, Congress held a series of hearings related to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950.  Many, including Jesse Jones (former head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation) felt that the $1 billion held by the FDIC was enough to cover any financial issues. Bankers agreed, for the most part, and by 1950, the deposit insurance fund reached over $1.2 billion. Although bank deposits were growing after World War II, interest rates were low, and bank earnings lagged as a result. At the same time, prices increased across the board and deposit insurance expenses went up.

	 

	The Federal Deposit Insurance act of 1950 lowered FDIC deposit insurance charges to ease pressure on banks. But rather than lowering the basic assessment rate, the overall reduction was made through rebates. The FDIC would keep 40% of income and the remainder would be refunded to banks, meaning that the risk would be shared 60-40 between the banks and the FDIC. 

	 

	Additionally, the 1950 legislation required the FDIC to reimburse the Treasury Department for any interest on initial capital contributions. The FDIC paid about $81 million to the Treasury. The legislation also removed the FDIC from the Federal Reserve Act’s jurisdiction and placed it under a separate body of law called the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Although this has proved to be largely a symbolic act, it does stress the separate nature of the FDIC.

	 

	In 1960, net assessments on banks were reduced again. The rebate percentage increased, to 66.66%, giving the FDIC a larger share of the risk in the event of a bank’s failure.

	 

	The first $100 million loss for the FDIC was in 1971, when the $109 million Birmingham Bloomfield Bank, located in a suburb of Detroit, failed. The institution had invested in long-term mutual funds, leaving it vulnerable to increases in interest rates. When the bank’s securities depreciated, the bank became insolvent. 

	 

	Additionally, there were 17 bank failures between 1971 and 1974. They were the first relatively large losses incurred by the FDIC. Adding to the trouble was increased competition among banks and a troubled economic climate. Rising inflation and oil prices made matters even worse. 

	 

	A recession in 1973–1975 led to problems with real estate loans, and bank failures remained high, peaking at 16 closures in 1976.

	 

	The years 1981 and 1982 saw much greater losses, which combined for approximately 74% of assessment income. Another recession, in 1981–1982, was severe. High unemployment and business failures, combined with a poor economy, caused 42 banks to fail in 1982. This included mutual savings banks. Although the economy began to improve in 1983, 27 banks failed during this period.

	 

	In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 into law. This legislation merged the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) with the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The new fund was known as the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and was made effective on March 31, 2006. 

	 

	At the end of 2007, the DIF had a balance of $52 billion.  Bank failures in 2008, including California’s IndyMac, forced the DIF’s balance downward, to approximately $45.2 billion. This decline caused the reserve ratio to fall to 1.01%, down from 1.19% in the previous quarter. Once this ratio, figured by dividing the fund’s balance by the number of insured deposits, falls below 1.15%, the FDIC must, by law, develop a plan to replenish the fund.

	 

	As the U.S. financial crisis grew in 2008, the FDIC took over 25 U.S. banks that had become insolvent, including Washington Mutual, which was that year’s largest bank failure. Additionally, the government injected $20 billion into faltering Citigroup.

	 

	In 2009, the FDIC began its Legacy Loans Program initiative, which helped banks remove its toxic assets in order to raise new funding and increase loan availability. The first bank takeover by a foreign financial institution occurred in August when BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Spain’s second-largest bank, took over the insolvent Texas-based Guaranty Bank. The FDIC split Guaranty’s losses on 11 billion loans with BBVA, which costs FDIC $3 billion. By year’s end, 552 banks were classified as troubled, including 140 insolvent.

	 

	That same year, Bank of America was rescued with a $20 billion bailout.

	 

	In 2010, 157 banks with $92 billion in holdings collapsed, and FDIC employed emergency powers to take over three banks in Puerto Rico, costing the agency $5.3 billion. Its list of troubled banks stood at 775 with a total of $431 billion assets.

	 

	As of mid-2010, while weathering the largest number of banking failures in over two decades, the FDIC held a reserve in its Deposit Insurance Fund of negative $20 billion, while holding $19 billion in U.S. Treasury securities and cash, with a $30 billion line of credit. It is also permitted to borrow up to $500 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The FDIC projects that its funds won’t be replenished to the statutory minimum level until 2017.

	 

	In 2011, 34 banks failed, costing the FDIC $588.1 million.

What it Does: 
	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) mitigates any potential damage to the United States economy by insuring deposits made to banks and other financial institutions. Savings, checking, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other deposit accounts (when combined) are insured up to $250,000 per depositor.

	 

	The FDIC does not insure securities, mutual funds, or similar investments, such as stocks, money market accounts, and bonds. It does not cover investments backed by the U.S. government, such as U.S. Treasury securities, contents of safe deposit boxes, accounting errors, or losses due to theft or fraud at an institution. Lastly, the FDIC does not provide insurance coverage to insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto, and homeowner’s insurance.

	 

	The FDIC identifies and monitors risks to its own deposit insurance funds. These funds are accumulated through premiums paid by banks that receive the FDIC’s deposit insurance and from interest earned on U.S. Treasury securities.

	 

	The FDIC oversees approximately 7,760 banks and savings banks. This is more than half of the financial institutions in the American banking system. Although the FDIC is the primary federal regulator of the banks chartered by states, it is also a back-up supervisor for remaining insured banks and thrift institutions.

	 

	When a bank fails, the FDIC has several options to help solve a failed bank’s financial problems, but the most popular remedy is to sell deposits and loans of the failed institutions to another institution. Customers of the old institution become customers of the new institution and can access their money in this way.

	 

	The FDIC has several components that help to achieve its goals. The FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion (ComE-IN) was established by Chairman Sheila C. Bair and the FDIC Board of Directors pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and chartered in November 2006. The committee was formed to provide the FDIC with advice and recommendations on banking policies and initiatives, especially as they relate to underserved populations. This may include reviewing basic retail financial services, such as check cashing, money orders, remittances, stored value cards, short-term loans, savings accounts, and other services that promote saving and investing.

	 

	The FDIC also has an Office of International Affairs that helps the agency address global financial issues, especially those of importance to the deposit insurance system. This office provides technical assistance, training and consulting services to foreign deposit insurers, bank supervisors and resolution authorities.

	 

	The FDIC is headquartered in Washington D.C., and has eight regional and field offices around the country, in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Memphis, New York, and San Francisco.

	 

	The agency is managed by a five-person Board of Directors, all of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three can be from the same political party. Currently, they are: Sheila C. Bair, Martin J. Gruenberg, Thomas J. Curry, John Walsh and John E. Bowman.

Where Does the Money Go: 
	The FDIC provides a list of its contractors for a variety of services, including management and marketing, securities financial advisory, appraisals, and data management. It also provides a breakdown of its 2011 contractors that are minority- and women-owned businesses. Among the contractors that FDIC has used are:

	 

	I Infinite Software which, in May 2008, won an FDIC contract to provide software, support and services to make the FDIC’s business processes more effective. The financial details of the contract were not released.

	 

	 

First Financial Network (FFN) was awarded the Internet Marketing and Support Services contract by the FDIC in January 2008. This contract requires FFN to market FDIC assets in receivership (those received from failed institutions and being readied for sale). Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed.

	 

Dynamics Research Corp. (DRC) won a contract with the FDIC worth $29 million to provide business analysis and management support systems. The contract is for seven and a half years. DRC has been asked to “promote, monitor and manage the FDIC’s system development projects to create a more efficient and effective deployment program.”

	 

	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company provides no information regarding payments to contractors through the federal website, USASpending.gov.

Controversies: 
FDIC Requests Overturning $72.3 Million Fee for Bullying 

	In August 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) had asked a New Orleans appeals court to overturn a ruling by a Texas judge in a case involving the agency’s “bullying” of financier Charles Hurwitz, whose Maxxam Corp. controlled Pacific Lumber. The FDIC had been ordered to pay a $72.3 million fine for supposedly browbeating Hurwitz into selling old-growth redwood trees in public parks. The FDIC maintained that its investigation of Hurwitz was justified, going back to his days at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which had business dealings with United Savings, a Texas savings and loan that failed in 1988. United Savings cost taxpayers $1.6 billion

Walmart Pulls Out of the Banking Business 

	In March 2007, the FDIC revealed that superstore Walmart had dropped its plans of opening a specialty bank. Walmart raised considerable controversy when it announced its plans in 2005. The retail giant said it was interested in providing financial services to its customers, but withdrew its application when it realized the process would take years, not months. A stumbling block for the giant retailer was federal legislation that imposed strict limitations on ownership of industrial loan companies (ILCs) and prohibited commercial firms deriving more than 15% of their gross revenues from activities that are not financial in nature. These moves were intended to prevent new banking enterprises from straining the FDIC’s safety net. The FDIC put a moratorium on approving any new ILC applications until January 31, 2008. Home Depot, another retail store, also had plans to launch its own ILC and was undeterred by Walmart’s decision. Other companies that have tried to launch similar plans or have been scuttled in the past include General Motors, BlueCross BlueShield, and a California credit union.

Nader Charges Many Banks Enjoying Free FDIC Coverage 

	In a March 2, 2002, post on his Web site, consumer advocate Ralph Nader charged that giveaways by the Clinton Administration had led to many commercial banks enjoying free federal deposit insurance since 1995. FDIC’s decision to let banks drop premiums when the insurance fund’s reserve reached the minimum of 1.25% of insured deposits has come back to haunt the agency, Nader charged, because as banks continue to fail, the reserves are not replenished equally. This failure to pay premiums has resulted in a surplus of $5–6 billion annually, and although lobbyists had suggested that the savings would be passed along to consumers, bank fees have continued to rise each year.

Suggested Reforms: 
Eliminate or Expand the FDIC?

	 

	Having insured bank deposits since the Depression, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has outlived its usefulness, according to some banking experts. Others, though, not only want it to stick around, but expand its mission.

	 

	Peter Atwater, who helped build JP Morgan’s securitization business during the late 1980s and early 1990s, wants to eliminate the FDIC. Atwater thinks doing so will promote bank stability, by removing the industry’s security blanket and encouraging it to be more responsible. As long as the FDIC is around, “depositor due diligence is non-existent.”

	 

	Meanwhile, Amar Bhide, the Thomas Schmidheiny Professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, wants the government to remove the $250,000 limit on FDIC insurance, so that banks can insure deposits made by corporations and wealthy investors.

FDIC Places Undue Burden on Taxpayers, Says Cato Report              

	An April 2002 Cato Foundation report warned against the FDIC’s policy of requiring taxpayers to be responsible for bank failures in funding losses. The report suggested a series of reforms, including tying FDIC premiums to risk, charging all insured institutions premiums, and indexing the deposit insurance coverage level to reflect its real value.

            My bank is Navy Army (Rockport Tx banch). I have a checking and a savings account. I needed to withdraw most of the money from each account... Totaling about $15k. They told me "I can only give you the amount you need from one account." They didn't even
 let me tell them how much I needed in total, before telling me they didn't have enough money on hand. They said they could write me a check for the rest of it. Where am I supposed to get that check cashed? I wish I could have them audited, to see how much
 money they had on hand. I believe I was lied to. When I left the counter, there were still people walking away from the counter with money in their hand. I could understand if I were trying to pull out $100s of thousands, but I just needed enough to get by.

            I was involved with a LLC doing a 20 lot development in PA. The LLC was not the borrower but classified as owner. The bank controlled all monies ad wire transferred over state lines to the contractor. The original contract stated that he would get waivers
 that subcontractors were paid. This was all done with an LOC and through the bank and a not township qualified engineer in accordance with Local, state and federal regulations. To make a long story short, my money was stolen or misappropriated PNC bank. I
 then put some of mine own money in to show good faith, was given a checkbook to write checks when they realized the LOC was short and had a Baltimore attorney draw up an agreement that I told my attorney was extortion. He states they would not release funds
 to a subcontractor if I did not sign which I did under duress. I have worked with many federal agencies with no result to get my money back. Then they foreclosed and I had to sell my home. Is there any violations involved in all these transactions and with
 no one telling me where my money is. Does a bank have to file taxes and how do they record missing money of clients. I only have the option to file criminal charges and all attorneys are lying to me, plus the corrupt local board made me adhere to all regulations
 and laws and they violated many. Any advice and action would be appreciated. With no documents as to where the money went is this theft is this against the RICO statute. Please respond, any help is appreciated and they are FDIC insured. Thank you. Bank was
 in MD, project in PA. How can they not account for this lose.

            I have a CD with CIT Bank of Springfield, MO which matured in Dec 15. I've been trying to cash it out and close it since then with no luck. Every time I call them, I get a different person who asks for information ( drivers liscense, address, password)
 which has been provided previously. Then then say the check will be sent, but I'm not getting it. Now they said to provide a wire transfer number with an account number and they will wire the money.. That was 3 weeks ago and still nothing transferred to my
 account. Who do I contact to get this bank to give me my money? It is CIT Bank PO box 11310, of Springfield Mo 65808. Their ad says they are FDIC insured.

            I am missing about $5,000..00 from my account at BB&T located at 106 S. St Marys Ste 100 SanAntonio, Texas 78205 (210 248 1599). I went to them and told them I had fraud on my account and they gave a refund and new a new account number. Guess what it happened
 again. I watched it for 2 months straight without making any transactions. My account zeroed out. When I took off work and went in person they say I must report it immediately. They would not close the account until I paid the negative balance. Guess what
 more fraud occurred. I went there again and wanted full access to all transactions. They said they could not access it. I was a customer for 1 1/2 years. I deserve some justice. They printed the actual transactions on the back of the statement so I never saw
 most of them. I need the statement so I can tell them what exactly is missing. I only have a few so yes, they do owe me and I would like to have my money.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

Gruenberg, Martin
Chairman





	A six-year board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Martin J. Gruenberg was nominated to be chairman of the FDIC by President Barack Obama in June 2011. He will function as acting chairman until his confirmation vote in the Senate.

	 

	Gruenberg attended college at Princeton, where he earned his undergraduate degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He went on to law school at Case Western Reserve, where he earned his JD.

	 

	Before becoming a member of the FDIC board, Gruenberg spent 18 years on Capitol Hill as a House and Senate staffer. In 1987, he joined the banking committee’s Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy, serving until 1992. Major legislation that Gruenberg worked on included the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.

	 

	In 1993, he moved to the Senate, becoming senior counsel to Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-Maryland) on the staff of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Gruenberg advised Sarbanes on issues of domestic and international financial regulation, monetary policy and trade.

	 

	He played an active role in crafting the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed after the Enron, Tyco and WorldCom scandals, which mandated major disclosure reforms for U.S. public companies.   

	 

	Gruenberg was appointed to the FDIC board in 2005 and was made vice chairman. After Chairman Donald Powell resigned, Gruenberg served as acting chairman from November 15, 2005, to June 26, 2006.

	 

	He was seen as a supporter of controversial Republican Sheila C. Bair, whom he would succeed, in her aggressive stance toward the banking industry during the financial crisis. 

	 

	Outside of his service on the board, Gruenberg was named chairman of the Executive Council and president of the International Association of Deposit Insurers in November 2007.

Overview: 

		The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the federal government responsible for insuring deposits made by individuals and companies in banks and other thrift institutions. The FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000. The agency also identifies and monitors risks to its deposit insurance funds and tries to limit the effects on the U.S. economy if a bank of thrift institution should fail. The FDIC is funded through premiums paid by banks and thrift institutions to pay for deposit coverage and from interest the agency earns on U.S. Treasury securities. Recent bank failures stemming from the mortgage crisis have drawn attention to the FDIC as it has tried to reimburse depositors. It also has come under criticism from those on both the left and right for its work, which has included restrictions that kept retail giant Walmart from getting into the banking business.

History: 
	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) was created in 1933 as a way to mitigate the damage caused by thousands of bank failures stemming from the stock market crash of 1929 and other risky investments. Nervous investors, worried about losing their life savings, began to withdraw money from banks all across the nation. In many cases, this led to bank failure, as institutions simply ran out of money. 

	 

	To help calm fears and bring some stability, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered a four-day bank holiday on March 6, 1933, during which U.S. banks were shut down to undergo inspections. Then, the President addressed the banking crisis in a speech of March 12, 1933 to reassure worried Americans. On June 16, President Roosevelt signed the Banking Act of 1933 (also known as the Glass-Steagall Act), which helped to form the FDIC, which was placed under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve.

	 

	The FDIC began extending its coverage for deposits on January 1, 1934. On July 5, 1934, Lydia Lobsiger received the first-ever federal deposit insurance disbursement, after the Fon Du Lac State Bank, in East Peoria, Illinois, failed. 

	 

	To avert any future banking catastrophes, Congress held a series of hearings related to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950.  Many, including Jesse Jones (former head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation) felt that the $1 billion held by the FDIC was enough to cover any financial issues. Bankers agreed, for the most part, and by 1950, the deposit insurance fund reached over $1.2 billion. Although bank deposits were growing after World War II, interest rates were low, and bank earnings lagged as a result. At the same time, prices increased across the board and deposit insurance expenses went up.

	 

	The Federal Deposit Insurance act of 1950 lowered FDIC deposit insurance charges to ease pressure on banks. But rather than lowering the basic assessment rate, the overall reduction was made through rebates. The FDIC would keep 40% of income and the remainder would be refunded to banks, meaning that the risk would be shared 60-40 between the banks and the FDIC. 

	 

	Additionally, the 1950 legislation required the FDIC to reimburse the Treasury Department for any interest on initial capital contributions. The FDIC paid about $81 million to the Treasury. The legislation also removed the FDIC from the Federal Reserve Act’s jurisdiction and placed it under a separate body of law called the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Although this has proved to be largely a symbolic act, it does stress the separate nature of the FDIC.

	 

	In 1960, net assessments on banks were reduced again. The rebate percentage increased, to 66.66%, giving the FDIC a larger share of the risk in the event of a bank’s failure.

	 

	The first $100 million loss for the FDIC was in 1971, when the $109 million Birmingham Bloomfield Bank, located in a suburb of Detroit, failed. The institution had invested in long-term mutual funds, leaving it vulnerable to increases in interest rates. When the bank’s securities depreciated, the bank became insolvent. 

	 

	Additionally, there were 17 bank failures between 1971 and 1974. They were the first relatively large losses incurred by the FDIC. Adding to the trouble was increased competition among banks and a troubled economic climate. Rising inflation and oil prices made matters even worse. 

	 

	A recession in 1973–1975 led to problems with real estate loans, and bank failures remained high, peaking at 16 closures in 1976.

	 

	The years 1981 and 1982 saw much greater losses, which combined for approximately 74% of assessment income. Another recession, in 1981–1982, was severe. High unemployment and business failures, combined with a poor economy, caused 42 banks to fail in 1982. This included mutual savings banks. Although the economy began to improve in 1983, 27 banks failed during this period.

	 

	In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 into law. This legislation merged the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) with the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The new fund was known as the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) and was made effective on March 31, 2006. 

	 

	At the end of 2007, the DIF had a balance of $52 billion.  Bank failures in 2008, including California’s IndyMac, forced the DIF’s balance downward, to approximately $45.2 billion. This decline caused the reserve ratio to fall to 1.01%, down from 1.19% in the previous quarter. Once this ratio, figured by dividing the fund’s balance by the number of insured deposits, falls below 1.15%, the FDIC must, by law, develop a plan to replenish the fund.

	 

	As the U.S. financial crisis grew in 2008, the FDIC took over 25 U.S. banks that had become insolvent, including Washington Mutual, which was that year’s largest bank failure. Additionally, the government injected $20 billion into faltering Citigroup.

	 

	In 2009, the FDIC began its Legacy Loans Program initiative, which helped banks remove its toxic assets in order to raise new funding and increase loan availability. The first bank takeover by a foreign financial institution occurred in August when BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Spain’s second-largest bank, took over the insolvent Texas-based Guaranty Bank. The FDIC split Guaranty’s losses on 11 billion loans with BBVA, which costs FDIC $3 billion. By year’s end, 552 banks were classified as troubled, including 140 insolvent.

	 

	That same year, Bank of America was rescued with a $20 billion bailout.

	 

	In 2010, 157 banks with $92 billion in holdings collapsed, and FDIC employed emergency powers to take over three banks in Puerto Rico, costing the agency $5.3 billion. Its list of troubled banks stood at 775 with a total of $431 billion assets.

	 

	As of mid-2010, while weathering the largest number of banking failures in over two decades, the FDIC held a reserve in its Deposit Insurance Fund of negative $20 billion, while holding $19 billion in U.S. Treasury securities and cash, with a $30 billion line of credit. It is also permitted to borrow up to $500 billion from the U.S. Treasury. The FDIC projects that its funds won’t be replenished to the statutory minimum level until 2017.

	 

	In 2011, 34 banks failed, costing the FDIC $588.1 million.

What it Does: 
	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) mitigates any potential damage to the United States economy by insuring deposits made to banks and other financial institutions. Savings, checking, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other deposit accounts (when combined) are insured up to $250,000 per depositor.

	 

	The FDIC does not insure securities, mutual funds, or similar investments, such as stocks, money market accounts, and bonds. It does not cover investments backed by the U.S. government, such as U.S. Treasury securities, contents of safe deposit boxes, accounting errors, or losses due to theft or fraud at an institution. Lastly, the FDIC does not provide insurance coverage to insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto, and homeowner’s insurance.

	 

	The FDIC identifies and monitors risks to its own deposit insurance funds. These funds are accumulated through premiums paid by banks that receive the FDIC’s deposit insurance and from interest earned on U.S. Treasury securities.

	 

	The FDIC oversees approximately 7,760 banks and savings banks. This is more than half of the financial institutions in the American banking system. Although the FDIC is the primary federal regulator of the banks chartered by states, it is also a back-up supervisor for remaining insured banks and thrift institutions.

	 

	When a bank fails, the FDIC has several options to help solve a failed bank’s financial problems, but the most popular remedy is to sell deposits and loans of the failed institutions to another institution. Customers of the old institution become customers of the new institution and can access their money in this way.

	 

	The FDIC has several components that help to achieve its goals. The FDIC Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion (ComE-IN) was established by Chairman Sheila C. Bair and the FDIC Board of Directors pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and chartered in November 2006. The committee was formed to provide the FDIC with advice and recommendations on banking policies and initiatives, especially as they relate to underserved populations. This may include reviewing basic retail financial services, such as check cashing, money orders, remittances, stored value cards, short-term loans, savings accounts, and other services that promote saving and investing.

	 

	The FDIC also has an Office of International Affairs that helps the agency address global financial issues, especially those of importance to the deposit insurance system. This office provides technical assistance, training and consulting services to foreign deposit insurers, bank supervisors and resolution authorities.

	 

	The FDIC is headquartered in Washington D.C., and has eight regional and field offices around the country, in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, Memphis, New York, and San Francisco.

	 

	The agency is managed by a five-person Board of Directors, all of whom are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three can be from the same political party. Currently, they are: Sheila C. Bair, Martin J. Gruenberg, Thomas J. Curry, John Walsh and John E. Bowman.

Where Does the Money Go: 
	The FDIC provides a list of its contractors for a variety of services, including management and marketing, securities financial advisory, appraisals, and data management. It also provides a breakdown of its 2011 contractors that are minority- and women-owned businesses. Among the contractors that FDIC has used are:

	 

	I Infinite Software which, in May 2008, won an FDIC contract to provide software, support and services to make the FDIC’s business processes more effective. The financial details of the contract were not released.

	 

	 

First Financial Network (FFN) was awarded the Internet Marketing and Support Services contract by the FDIC in January 2008. This contract requires FFN to market FDIC assets in receivership (those received from failed institutions and being readied for sale). Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed.

	 

Dynamics Research Corp. (DRC) won a contract with the FDIC worth $29 million to provide business analysis and management support systems. The contract is for seven and a half years. DRC has been asked to “promote, monitor and manage the FDIC’s system development projects to create a more efficient and effective deployment program.”

	 

	The Federal Deposit Insurance Company provides no information regarding payments to contractors through the federal website, USASpending.gov.

Controversies: 
FDIC Requests Overturning $72.3 Million Fee for Bullying 

	In August 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) had asked a New Orleans appeals court to overturn a ruling by a Texas judge in a case involving the agency’s “bullying” of financier Charles Hurwitz, whose Maxxam Corp. controlled Pacific Lumber. The FDIC had been ordered to pay a $72.3 million fine for supposedly browbeating Hurwitz into selling old-growth redwood trees in public parks. The FDIC maintained that its investigation of Hurwitz was justified, going back to his days at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which had business dealings with United Savings, a Texas savings and loan that failed in 1988. United Savings cost taxpayers $1.6 billion

Walmart Pulls Out of the Banking Business 

	In March 2007, the FDIC revealed that superstore Walmart had dropped its plans of opening a specialty bank. Walmart raised considerable controversy when it announced its plans in 2005. The retail giant said it was interested in providing financial services to its customers, but withdrew its application when it realized the process would take years, not months. A stumbling block for the giant retailer was federal legislation that imposed strict limitations on ownership of industrial loan companies (ILCs) and prohibited commercial firms deriving more than 15% of their gross revenues from activities that are not financial in nature. These moves were intended to prevent new banking enterprises from straining the FDIC’s safety net. The FDIC put a moratorium on approving any new ILC applications until January 31, 2008. Home Depot, another retail store, also had plans to launch its own ILC and was undeterred by Walmart’s decision. Other companies that have tried to launch similar plans or have been scuttled in the past include General Motors, BlueCross BlueShield, and a California credit union.

Nader Charges Many Banks Enjoying Free FDIC Coverage 

	In a March 2, 2002, post on his Web site, consumer advocate Ralph Nader charged that giveaways by the Clinton Administration had led to many commercial banks enjoying free federal deposit insurance since 1995. FDIC’s decision to let banks drop premiums when the insurance fund’s reserve reached the minimum of 1.25% of insured deposits has come back to haunt the agency, Nader charged, because as banks continue to fail, the reserves are not replenished equally. This failure to pay premiums has resulted in a surplus of $5–6 billion annually, and although lobbyists had suggested that the savings would be passed along to consumers, bank fees have continued to rise each year.

Suggested Reforms: 
Eliminate or Expand the FDIC?

	 

	Having insured bank deposits since the Depression, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has outlived its usefulness, according to some banking experts. Others, though, not only want it to stick around, but expand its mission.

	 

	Peter Atwater, who helped build JP Morgan’s securitization business during the late 1980s and early 1990s, wants to eliminate the FDIC. Atwater thinks doing so will promote bank stability, by removing the industry’s security blanket and encouraging it to be more responsible. As long as the FDIC is around, “depositor due diligence is non-existent.”

	 

	Meanwhile, Amar Bhide, the Thomas Schmidheiny Professor at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, wants the government to remove the $250,000 limit on FDIC insurance, so that banks can insure deposits made by corporations and wealthy investors.

FDIC Places Undue Burden on Taxpayers, Says Cato Report              

	An April 2002 Cato Foundation report warned against the FDIC’s policy of requiring taxpayers to be responsible for bank failures in funding losses. The report suggested a series of reforms, including tying FDIC premiums to risk, charging all insured institutions premiums, and indexing the deposit insurance coverage level to reflect its real value.

            My bank is Navy Army (Rockport Tx banch). I have a checking and a savings account. I needed to withdraw most of the money from each account... Totaling about $15k. They told me "I can only give you the amount you need from one account." They didn't even
 let me tell them how much I needed in total, before telling me they didn't have enough money on hand. They said they could write me a check for the rest of it. Where am I supposed to get that check cashed? I wish I could have them audited, to see how much
 money they had on hand. I believe I was lied to. When I left the counter, there were still people walking away from the counter with money in their hand. I could understand if I were trying to pull out $100s of thousands, but I just needed enough to get by.

            I was involved with a LLC doing a 20 lot development in PA. The LLC was not the borrower but classified as owner. The bank controlled all monies ad wire transferred over state lines to the contractor. The original contract stated that he would get waivers
 that subcontractors were paid. This was all done with an LOC and through the bank and a not township qualified engineer in accordance with Local, state and federal regulations. To make a long story short, my money was stolen or misappropriated PNC bank. I
 then put some of mine own money in to show good faith, was given a checkbook to write checks when they realized the LOC was short and had a Baltimore attorney draw up an agreement that I told my attorney was extortion. He states they would not release funds
 to a subcontractor if I did not sign which I did under duress. I have worked with many federal agencies with no result to get my money back. Then they foreclosed and I had to sell my home. Is there any violations involved in all these transactions and with
 no one telling me where my money is. Does a bank have to file taxes and how do they record missing money of clients. I only have the option to file criminal charges and all attorneys are lying to me, plus the corrupt local board made me adhere to all regulations
 and laws and they violated many. Any advice and action would be appreciated. With no documents as to where the money went is this theft is this against the RICO statute. Please respond, any help is appreciated and they are FDIC insured. Thank you. Bank was
 in MD, project in PA. How can they not account for this lose.

            I have a CD with CIT Bank of Springfield, MO which matured in Dec 15. I've been trying to cash it out and close it since then with no luck. Every time I call them, I get a different person who asks for information ( drivers liscense, address, password)
 which has been provided previously. Then then say the check will be sent, but I'm not getting it. Now they said to provide a wire transfer number with an account number and they will wire the money.. That was 3 weeks ago and still nothing transferred to my
 account. Who do I contact to get this bank to give me my money? It is CIT Bank PO box 11310, of Springfield Mo 65808. Their ad says they are FDIC insured.

            I am missing about $5,000..00 from my account at BB&T located at 106 S. St Marys Ste 100 SanAntonio, Texas 78205 (210 248 1599). I went to them and told them I had fraud on my account and they gave a refund and new a new account number. Guess what it happened
 again. I watched it for 2 months straight without making any transactions. My account zeroed out. When I took off work and went in person they say I must report it immediately. They would not close the account until I paid the negative balance. Guess what
 more fraud occurred. I went there again and wanted full access to all transactions. They said they could not access it. I was a customer for 1 1/2 years. I deserve some justice. They printed the actual transactions on the back of the statement so I never saw
 most of them. I need the statement so I can tell them what exactly is missing. I only have a few so yes, they do owe me and I would like to have my money.

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)

Gruenberg, Martin
Chairman





	A six-year board member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Martin J. Gruenberg was nominated to be chairman of the FDIC by President Barack Obama in June 2011. He will function as acting chairman until his confirmation vote in the Senate.

	 

	Gruenberg attended college at Princeton, where he earned his undergraduate degree from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He went on to law school at Case Western Reserve, where he earned his JD.

	 

	Before becoming a member of the FDIC board, Gruenberg spent 18 years on Capitol Hill as a House and Senate staffer. In 1987, he joined the banking committee’s Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy, serving until 1992. Major legislation that Gruenberg worked on included the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991.

	 

	In 1993, he moved to the Senate, becoming senior counsel to Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-Maryland) on the staff of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Gruenberg advised Sarbanes on issues of domestic and international financial regulation, monetary policy and trade.

	 

	He played an active role in crafting the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed after the Enron, Tyco and WorldCom scandals, which mandated major disclosure reforms for U.S. public companies.   

	 

	Gruenberg was appointed to the FDIC board in 2005 and was made vice chairman. After Chairman Donald Powell resigned, Gruenberg served as acting chairman from November 15, 2005, to June 26, 2006.

	 

	He was seen as a supporter of controversial Republican Sheila C. Bair, whom he would succeed, in her aggressive stance toward the banking industry during the financial crisis. 

	 

	Outside of his service on the board, Gruenberg was named chairman of the Executive Council and president of the International Association of Deposit Insurers in November 2007.

She worked as research director, deputy counsel and counsel to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole from 1981 to 1988 and commissioner and acting chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1991 to 1995.
 
Bair was Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange from 1995 to 2000 and then served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the US Department of the Treasury from 2001 to 2002.

Rental Property Insurance


Rental property insurance is important not only to the property owner who's renting out, but also to the tenant who rents the property. It really is not enough for a property to be ensured by the landlord or the property owner as the landlord's insurance will usually cover only the building or the contents of the building that the landlord owns. The landlord's insurance will definitely not provide coverage for your personal belongings nor will it cover injuries incurred by your guests.
Why You Should Get Rental Property Insurance
Don't think that you don't need protection just because you're only renting your place of residence. You don't have to be a homeowner to be concerned of your home and your personal properties. In fact, anyone renting can easily qualify for rental property insurance.
Rental Property Insurance Coverage
Rental property insurance policies offer many types of coverage. You should learn as much as you can about these coverage types, so you can decide which is most appropriate for your situation. You should also ensure that you get enough coverage for any circumstance that might come up.
Below are some of the coverage types you can choose from.

Personal property: This coverage provides protection for your personal property, such as clothes and furniture. This coverage can also include your personal belongings when you're away from home or traveling. 
Loss of use: This coverage provides for your living expenses if you are unable to live in your home due to an insured loss. Coverage includes food and shelter for the period that your home is being repaired or replaced. Duration of coverage can be up to two years. 
Personal liability: This coverage provides for your legal obligations if an injury has been incurred or a property has been damaged in your home. 
Medical payments to others: This coverage provides for the medical expenses of injured guests in your home. This coverage does not include payments for injuries that you incur, nor does it cover injuries incurred by other family members who live with you. 

Rental Property Insurance - Some Considerations
When availing of rental property insurance, you should decide whether to insure the place you are renting at the replacement value or at the actual cash value. Insuring at the replacement value pays out the total amount of the property regardless of depreciation. On the other hand, insuring at the actual cash value pays out the amount of your property after depreciation.
Rental property insurance is affordable, considering the amount of coverage you get. However, be clear on the terms of your rental property insurance policy, and know exactly what's included in your coverage.

What Are Home Insurance Benefits?
How much a homeowners insurance policy will benefit someone depends on the person. Many household items are covered and some people don't even realize the extent of coverage they have.

Is Home Insurance for New or Old Homes?

Homeowners Insurance Rate Discounts


Home insurance covers damage and replacement costs to property, structures and possessions. Depending on the amount of property insured, the cost of insuring a house and possessions can become expensive. If an individual is insuring a house that is in a “high risk” area such as an earthquake zone or flood plain, the costs of insuring the home can be even more expensive.
Guidelines for Saving Money on Rates
There are steps homeowners can take to help reduce costs of homeowners insurance rates. Not all of these will be applicable in all states. Home insurance discounts and lower prices can usually be obtained by following a few general guidelines:

Compare prices – Different insurance companies charge different rates. Collecting a few quotes from different companies gives a homeowner the ability to choose the plan that best suits their financial needs. Also, by visiting with agents or calling different companies, homeowners can get a feel for how the company may interact with them should there be a claim. 
Raise the deductible – A higher deductible means lower premiums      to pay. Keep in mind that should disaster hit, an individual should be able to pay the higher deductible if he or she wants to fully repair or restore property damage. Also, depending on the location of the home, the      homeowner may be required to own separate insurance for different types of disasters. These separate policies each have their own deductible which can also be raised to provide lower premiums. 
Purchase multiple insurance policies from the same company – Most      companies will provide discounts on home insurance policies if the homeowner also purchases their auto insurance from the same company. Usually, the more policies purchased from the company, the more each individual policy is discounted. 
Build in protection – Making small and large improvements to a      home in order to make it stronger and less vulnerable to common disasters can lower the home insurance rate. Reinforcing roofs in windstorm-prone areas or retrofitting an older home in an earthquake zone are two examples. 
Insure the house, not the land – The purchase price of a house      includes the land value as well. Since land cannot be stolen and is generally less prone to damage than a house, its value doesn’t need to be included with insurance rebuilding costs. Insure the house, not the land. 
Security systems – Fire alarms and monitored security systems often      provide homeowners a discount through the insurance company. Some locking systems and sprinkler systems for fire also qualify. Since not all security systems and measures qualify for discounts and others are expensive, a homeowner should check with the insurance company to see what      systems qualify for a discount before purchasing or installing the system. 
Ask – Ask the insurance company what kinds of discounts they offer. Different companies offer different discounts and incentives. 
Group insurance coverage – Some homeowners insurance rate      discounts is available through groups such as alumni organizations or professional associations. 
Long-term discounts – Some insurance companies offer discounts to      homeowners who stay with them for long periods. Homeowners should still periodically compare their insurance price with that of other companies. 
Review policies annually – If improvements have been made or      expensive furnishings acquired, then the amount of coverage on a home insurance policy needs to reflect these changes. Furthermore, if certain possessions have lost value or are no longer around, then there is no reason for the insurance policy to protect their value. 
Private vs. Government – Some homeowners in high-risk areas can      purchase insurance through the government. Sometimes homeowners insurance rate discounts can be found by searching out private companies that may be able to sell in the area and comparing prices. 
Calculate insurance before purchasing – by investigating risks      before purchasing a house, a homeowner (or in this case, prospective buyer) can determine the approximate cost of insurance before purchase.

Renters Insurance Quotes


The two of you are living together and engaged to be married. You've entered into the, "What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine" frame of mind. You borrow his bike, his clothes; he plays your CDs and uses your laptop. Sometimes, you leave your engagement ring at home, afraid of losing or damaging or, perish the thought, giving someone the chance to steal it. But you aren't sure if it's covered by your betrothed's home contents insurance. You've only been living together a few months in what used to be exclusively his apartment. Is any of your stuff insured under his policy? It may be time to look up renters insurance quotes.
Now is the time for the two of you to create an actual home inventory, not a guesstimate, of all the personal property in the apartment you'd like to insure against damage or loss. Even though you aren't married yet, some states and insurers will allow you to obtain apartment renters insurance together-one policy, both of your names-while others will make each of you get your own policy.
To create a home inventory, which will help you decide how much home contents insurance you need and make filing a claim easier, add up the cost of everything you would want to replace if it were damaged or stolen. Record model numbers, dates and places of purchase. Take photographs or make a video of these items and place a copy of the inventory in a safe place away from your home.
Bear in mind when you look up renters insurance quotes that most policies have standard coverage limits, i.e., a dollar limit on jewelry that is stolen. Be sure to review these limits and, for expensive jewelry and other valuables you may want to consider buying additional coverage. These additions to your policy provide higher limits and broader coverage.
As for home owners, it isn't difficult for unmarried couples to buy homeowner's insurance together at the same rates offered to the married, as long as both partners own the house. If the title to the property bears only one name, the personal property of the other will not be automatically covered by the policy. The non-owner can perhaps be added as an occupant-check with your insurer about this-or may need to get separate policies when getting renters insurance quotes.
Finally, if you or your mate work out of your home, you may need a special policy to cover expensive equipment, not to mention extra liability coverage if you receive clients in your home. Just one more thing to think about as you merge households and begin to acquire property of real as well as symbolic value.

What To Do If You are Dropped By Homeowners Insurance

What To Do If You are Dropped By Homeowners Insurance


What should you do if you are dropped from your homeowner insurance policy, either because of claims filed, or because the insurance company is no longer offering coverage in your area?
Don't panic. You won't go uninsured. Depending on the state or type of mortgage you might have, 					you simply can't go uninsured. There are options in place to help you get coverage, no matter 					what. If you receive notice that you are being dropped, you have a window of time before that goes 					into effect; just be sure to use that time wisely and shop around.
Your insurance company is required to state the specific reason you are being 					dropped. If the company is moving out of the area (either physical or coverage), then you should 					have little trouble finding another company to cover you. Check with your state insurance 					department for referrals to other companies-keep in mind that this is a great opportunity for you 					to get the exact homeowner insurance and home contents insurance you need. In other words, be sure 					to shop around.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, has recently provided 					supplemental flood insurance to homeowners in some areas.
If the reason listed on the cancellation notice has to do with claims 					previously filed, make whatever efforts necessary to resolve your standing in the eyes of the 					industry. You don't necessarily have to have your roof wholly replaced by the time you start 					shopping for a new policy, but a documented good faith effort to reconcile the reasons against you 					will go far in the eyes of your new insurance provider. Also make sure to take a look at your 					Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) score, which is like a credit score for your 					insurance history, and dispute anything on it you might find falsely claimed.
You might also find yourself impacted by the number of claims you've filed over the years, or because you live in a high-risk area. Again, realize that individual states have agencies in place to help out. Several states participate in a program called FAIR, or Fair Access to Insurance Requirements, to cover those in the high-risk pool. Check with your state insurance regulatory agency to find out whether you live in one of the FAIR states. If your state is not a FAIR state, there may be similar policies that will cover you.

Bank sign indicating the original insurance limit offered by the FDIC of $2,500 in 1934.


The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]

2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

Bank sign indicating the original insurance limit offered by the FDIC of $2,500 in 1934.


The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

Notes[edit]



^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is a United States government corporation providing deposit insurance to depositors in US banks. The FDIC was created by the 1933 Banking Act during the Great Depression to restore trust in the American banking system; more than one-third of banks failed in the years before the FDIC's creation, and bank runs were common.[2] The insurance limit was initially US$2,500 per ownership category. Since the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2011, the FDIC insures deposits in member banks up to US $250,000 per ownership category.[3]
The FDIC and its reserves are not funded by public funds; member banks' insurance dues are the FDIC's primary source of funding.[4] The FDIC also has a US$100 billion line of credit with the United States Department of the Treasury.[5] Only banks are insured by the FDIC; credit unions are insured up to the same insurance limit by the National Credit Union Administration, which is also a government agency.
As of May 1, 2017[update], the FDIC provided deposit insurance at 5,844 institutions.[6] The FDIC also examines and supervises certain financial institutions for safety and soundness, performs certain consumer-protection functions, and manages receiverships of failed banks.

Ownership categories[edit]
Each ownership category of a depositor's money is insured separately up to the insurance limit, and separately at each bank. Thus a depositor with $250,000 in each of three ownership categories at each of two banks would have six different insurance limits of $250,000, for total insurance coverage of 6 × $250,000 = $1,500,000.[7] The distinct ownership categories are[7]

Single accounts (accounts not falling into any other category)
Certain retirement accounts (including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs))
Joint accounts (accounts with more than one owner with equal rights to withdraw)
Revocable trust accounts (containing the words "Payable on death", "In trust for", etc.)
Irrevocable trust accounts
Employee Benefit Plan accounts (deposits of a pension plan)
Corporation/Partnership/Unincorporated Association accounts
Government accounts

All amounts that a particular depositor has in accounts in any particular ownership category at a particular bank are added together and are insured up to $250,000.
For joint accounts, each co-owner is assumed (unless the account specifically states otherwise) to own the same fraction of the account as does each other co-owner (even though each co-owner may be eligible to withdraw all funds from the account). Thus if three people jointly own a $750,000 account, the entire account balance is insured because each depositor's $250,000 share of the account is insured.
The owner of a revocable trust account is generally insured up to $250,000 for each unique beneficiary (subject to special rules if there are more than five of them). Thus if there is a single owner of an account that is specified as in trust for (payable on death to, etc.) three different beneficiaries, the funds in the account are insured up to $750,000.
Board of directors[edit]
The Board of Directors of the FDIC is the governing body of the FDIC. The board is composed of five members, three appointed by the president of the United States with the consent of the United States Senate and two ex officio members. The three appointed members each serve six-year terms. No more than three members of the board may be of the same political affiliation. The president, with the consent of the Senate, also designates one of the appointed members as chairman of the board, to serve a five-year term, and one of the appointed members as vice chairman of the board, to also serve a five-year term. The two ex officio members are the Comptroller of the Currency and the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
As of January 1, 2016, the members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were:

Martin J. Gruenberg – Chairman of the Board
Thomas M. Hoenig – Vice Chairman
Thomas J. Curry – Comptroller of the Currency
Richard Cordray – Director, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau[8]

History[edit]
Panics of 1893 and 1907 and the Great Depression: 1893-1933[edit]
Further information: Panic of 1907 and Great Depression
During the Panics of 1893 and 1907, many banks[note 1] filed bankruptcy due to bank runs caused by contagion. Both of the panics renewed discussion on deposit insurance. In 1893, William Jennings Bryan presented a bill to Congress proposing a national deposit insurance fund. No action was taken, as the legislature paid more attention to the agricultural depression at the time.[9]
After 1907, eight states established deposit insurance funds.[10] Due to the lax regulation of banks and the widespread inability of banks to branch; small, local unit banks—often with poor financial health—grew in numbers, especially in the western and southern states.[11] In 1921, there were about 31,000 banks in the US.[12] The Federal Reserve Act initially included a provision for nationwide deposit insurance, but it was removed from the bill by the House of Representatives. From 1893 to the FDIC's creation in 1933, 150 bills were submitted in Congress proposing deposit insurance.[13]
The Great Depression devastated the American banking system. There was widespread panic over the American banking system; in the years before the FDIC's creation, more than one-third of all banks failed due to bank runs.[2] Small banks in rural areas were especially affected. Reassurances and regulations by the government failed to assuage depositors' fears. Many depositors withdrew their assets in failed or nearly-insolvent banks.
Establishment of the FDIC: 1933[edit]
President Franklin D. Roosevelt himself was dubious about insuring bank deposits, saying, "We do not wish to make the United States Government liable for the mistakes and errors of individual banks, and put a premium on unsound banking in the future." But public support was overwhelmingly in favor, and the number of bank failures dropped to near zero.[14] On 16 June 1933, Roosevelt signed the 1933 Banking Act into law, creating the FDIC. The initial plan set by Congress in 1934 was to insure deposits up to $2,500 ($44,757 today)[15] adopting of a more generous, long-term plan after six months.[note 2] However, the latter plan was abandoned for an increase of the insurance limit to $5,000 ($89,515 today).[15][16]




President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signs the Banking Act of 1935.


The 1933 Banking Act:

Established the FDIC as a temporary government corporation. The Banking Act of 1935 made the FDIC a permanent agency of the government and provided permanent deposit insurance maintained at the $5,000 level.
Gave the FDIC authority to provide deposit insurance to banks
Gave the FDIC the authority to regulate and supervise state non-member banks
Funded the FDIC with initial loans of $289 million through the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which were later paid back with interest
Extended federal oversight to all commercial banks for the first time
Separated commercial and investment banking (Glass–Steagall Act)
Prohibited banks from paying interest on checking accounts
Allowed national banks to branch statewide, if allowed by state law.

Historical insurance limits[edit]

1934 – $2,500
1935 – $5,000
1950 – $10,000
1966 – $15,000
1969 – $20,000
1974 – $40,000
1980 – $100,000
2008 – $250,000

Congress approved a temporary increase in the deposit insurance limit from $100,000 to $250,000, which was effective from October 3, 2008, through December 31, 2010. On May 20, 2009, the temporary increase was extended through December 31, 2013. However, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L.111-203), which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, made the $250,000 insurance limit permanent.[17] In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (P.L.109-171) allows for the boards of the FDIC and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to consider inflation and other factors every five years beginning in 2010 and, if warranted, to adjust the amounts under a specified formula.[18][19]
S&L and bank crisis of the 1980s[edit]
Main article: Savings and loan crisis
Federal deposit insurance received its first large-scale test since the Great Depression in the late 1980s and early 1990s during the savings and loan crisis (which also affected commercial banks and savings banks).
The brunt of the crisis fell upon a parallel deposit insurer, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), created to insure savings and loan (S&L) institutions (S&Ls, also called thrifts). Because of a confluence of events, much of the S&L industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. The FSLIC became insolvent and was abolished in August 1989. It was replaced by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision. (Credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration.) The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.
Final combined total for all direct and indirect losses of FSLIC and RTC resolutions was an estimated $152.9 billion. Of this total amount, U.S. taxpayer losses amounted to approximately $123.8 billion (81% of the total costs.)[20]
No taxpayer money was used to resolve FDIC-insured institutions.
2008–2010 Financial crisis[edit]
Further information: 2007–2012 global financial crisis
2008[edit]
In 2008, twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were closed by their respective chartering authority.[21] However, during that year, the largest bank failure in terms of dollar value occurred on September 26, 2008, when Washington Mutual, with $307 billion in assets, experienced a 10-day bank run on its deposits.[22][23]
The FDIC created the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks, thrifts, and certain holding companies, and by providing full coverage of non-interest bearing deposit transaction accounts, regardless of dollar amount.
The deposit insurance limit was temporarily raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
2009[edit]
On August 14, 2009, Bloomberg reported that more than 150 publicly traded U.S. lenders had nonperforming loans above 5% of their total holdings. This is important because former regulators say that this is the level that can wipe out a bank's equity and threaten its survival. While this ratio does not always lead to bank failures if the banks in question have raised additional capital and have properly established reserves for the bad debt, it is an important indicator for future FDIC activity.[24]
On August 21, 2009, Guaranty Bank, in Texas, became insolvent and was taken over by BBVA Compass, the U.S. division of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, the second-largest bank in Spain. This was the first foreign company to buy a failed bank during the credit crisis of 2008 and 2009. In addition, the FDIC agreed to share losses with BBVA on about $11 billion of Guaranty Bank's loans and other assets.[25] This transaction alone cost the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund $3 billion.
On August 27, 2009, the FDIC increased the number of troubled banks to 416 in the second quarter. That number compares to 305 just three months earlier.[26] At the end of the third quarter, that number jumped to 552.[27]
At the close of 2009, a total of 140 banks had become insolvent.[28] This is the largest number of bank failures in a year since 1992, when 179 institutions failed.[29]
2010[edit]
On February 23, 2010, FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warned that the number of failures in 2010 could surpass the 140 banks that were seized in 2009. Commercial real estate overexposure was deemed the most serious threat to banks in 2010.[28]
On April 30, 2010, the FDIC was appointed as receiver for three banks in Puerto Rico at a cost of $5.3 billion.[30]
In 2010, 157 banks with approximately $92 billion in total assets failed.[31]
In 2010, a new division within the FDIC, the Office of Complex Financial Institutions, was created to focus on the expanded responsibilities of the FDIC by the Dodd-Frank Act for the assessment of risk in the largest, systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs.[32][33][34] Its current director is James Wigand. In June 2013, Wigand announced that he will be stepping down as director.[35]
Funds[edit]
Former funds[edit]
Between 1989 and 2006, there were two separate FDIC funds – the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF). The latter was established after the savings and loans crisis of the 1980s. The existence of two separate funds for the same purpose led to banks' attempting to shift from one fund to another, depending on the benefits each could provide. In the 1990s, SAIF premiums were, at one point, five times higher than BIF premiums; several banks attempted to qualify for the BIF, with some merging with institutions qualified for the BIF to avoid the higher premiums of the SAIF. This drove up the BIF premiums as well, resulting in a situation where both funds were charging higher premiums than necessary.[36]
Then Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan was a critic of the system, saying, "We are, in effect, attempting to use government to enforce two different prices for the same item – namely, government-mandated deposit insurance. Such price differences only create efforts by market participants to arbitrage the difference." Greenspan proposed "to end this game and merge SAIF and BIF".[37]
Deposit Insurance Fund[edit]
In February 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (FDIRA) and a related conforming amendments act. The FDIRA contains technical and conforming changes to implement deposit insurance reform, as well as a number of study and survey requirements. Among the highlights of this law was merging the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) and the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF) into a new fund, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). This change was made effective March 31, 2006. The FDIC maintains the DIF by assessing depository institutions an insurance premium. The amount each institution is assessed is based both on the balance of insured deposits as well as on the degree of risk the institution poses to the insurance fund.
Bank failures typically represent a cost to the DIF because the FDIC, as receiver of the failed institution, must liquidate assets that have declined substantially in value while, at the same time, making good on the institution's deposit obligations.
Bond interest payments of the Financing Corporation, the funding vehicle for the "Resolution Fund" of the now defunct Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), are funded by DIF premiums.
A March 2008 memorandum to the FDIC board of directors shows a 2007 year-end Deposit Insurance Fund balance of about $52.4 billion, which represented a reserve ratio of 1.22% of its exposure to insured deposits, totaling about $4.29 trillion. The 2008 year-end insured deposits were projected to reach about $4.42 trillion with the reserve growing to $55.2 billion, a ratio of 1.25%.[38] As of June 2008, the DIF had a balance of $45.2 billion.[39] However, 9 months later, in March, 2009, the DIF fell to $13 billion.[40] That was the lowest total since September, 1993[40] and represented a reserve ratio of 0.27% of its exposure to insured deposits totaling about $4.83 trillion.[41] In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed an emergency fee aimed at raising $5.6 billion to replenish the DIF.[42] However, Saxo Bank Research reported that, after Aug 7, further bank failures had reduced the DIF balance to $648.1 million.[43] FDIC-estimated costs of assuming additional failed banks on Aug 14 exceeded that amount.[citation needed] The FDIC announced its intent, on September 29, 2009, to assess the banks, in advance, for three years' of premiums in an effort to avoid DIF insolvency. The FDIC revised its estimated costs of bank failures to about $100 billion over the next four years, an increase of $30 billion from the $70 billion estimate of earlier in 2009. The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time of the assessment.[44] The fund is mandated by law to keep a balance equivalent to 1.15 percent of insured deposits.[44] As of June 30, 2008, the insured banks held approximately $7,025 billion in total deposits, though not all of those are insured.[45] As of September 30, 2012, total deposits at FDIC-insured institutions totaled roughly $10.54 trillion, although not all deposits are insured.[46]
The DIF's reserves are not the only cash resources available to the FDIC. In addition to $67.3 billion of cash and U.S. Treasury securities held as of March 2016,[47] the FDIC has the ability to borrow up to $100 billion from the Treasury. The FDIC can also demand special assessments from banks as it did in the second quarter of 2009.[48][49]
"Full Faith and Credit"[edit]
In light of apparent systemic risks facing the banking system, the adequacy of FDIC's financial backing has come into question. According to the FDIC.gov website (as of March 2013), "FDIC deposit insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. This means that the resources of the United States government stand behind FDIC-insured depositors."[50] The statutory basis for this assertion is unclear, however. Congress, in 1987, passed a "Sense of Congress" to that effect,[51] but such enactments do not carry the force of law.[52]
Insurance requirements[edit]
To receive this benefit, member banks must follow certain liquidity and reserve requirements. Banks are classified in five groups according to their risk-based capital ratio:

Well capitalized: 10% or higher
Adequately capitalized: 8% or higher
Undercapitalized: less than 8%
Significantly undercapitalized: less than 6%
Critically undercapitalized: less than 2%

When a bank becomes undercapitalized, the institution's primary regulator issues a warning to the bank. When the number drops below 6%, the primary regulator can change management and force the bank to take other corrective action. When the bank becomes critically undercapitalized the chartering authority closes the institution and appoints the FDIC as receiver of the bank.
At Q4 2010 884 banks had very low capital cushions against risk and were on the FDIC's "problem list". This was nearly 12 percent of all federally insured banks, the highest level in 18 years.[53][needs update]
Resolution of insolvent banks[edit]
A bank's chartering authority—either an individual state banking department or the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency—closes a bank and appoints the FDIC as receiver. In its role as a receiver the FDIC is tasked with protecting the depositors and maximizing the recoveries for the creditors of the failed institution. The FDIC does not close banks.
The FDIC as receiver is functionally and legally separate from the FDIC acting in its corporate role as deposit insurer, and the FDIC as receiver has separate rights, duties, and obligations from those of the FDIC as insurer. Courts have long recognized these dual and separate capacities.
In 1991, to comply with legislation, the FDIC amended its failure resolution procedures to decrease the costs to the deposit insurance funds. The procedures require the FDIC to choose the resolution alternative that is least costly to the deposit insurance fund of all possible methods for resolving the failed institution. Bids are submitted to the FDIC where they are reviewed and the least cost determination is made.
A receivership is designed to market the assets of a failed institution, liquidate them, and distribute the proceeds to the institution's creditors. The FDIC as receiver succeeds to the rights, powers, and privileges of the institution and its stockholders, officers, and directors. The FDIC may collect all obligations and money due to the institution, preserve or liquidate its assets and property, and perform any other function of the institution consistent with its appointment.
A receiver also has the power to merge a failed institution with another insured depository institution and to transfer its assets and liabilities without the consent or approval of any other agency, court, or party with contractual rights. Furthermore, a receiver may form a new institution, such as a bridge bank, to take over the assets and liabilities of the failed institution, or it may sell or pledge the assets of the failed institution to the FDIC in its corporate capacity.
The two most common ways for the FDIC to resolve a closed institution and fulfill its role as a receiver are:

Purchase and Assumption Agreement (P&A), in which deposits (liabilities) are assumed by an open bank, which also purchases some or all of the failed bank's loans (assets). The bank's assets[54] that convey to the FDIC as receiver are sold and auctioned through various methods, including online, and using contractors.
Deposit Payoff, as soon as the appropriate chartering authority closes the bank or thrift, the FDIC is appointed receiver. The FDIC as insurer pays all of the failed institution's depositors[55] with insured funds the full amount of their insured deposits. Depositors with uninsured funds and other general creditors (such as suppliers and service providers) of the failed institution do not receive either immediate or full reimbursement; instead, the FDIC as receiver issues them receivership certificates. A receivership certificate entitles its holder to a portion of the receiver's collections on the failed institution's assets.

Covered Insured Depository Institutions Resolution Plans[edit]
To assist the FDIC in resolving an insolvent bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In addition to the Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d),[56] the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured Depository Institution ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., "material entities"), as well as one or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.[57]
On December 17, the FDIC issued guidance for the 2015 resolution plans of CIDIs of large bank holding companies (BHCs).[58] The guidance provides clarity on the assumptions that are to be made in the CIDI resolution plans and what must be addressed and analyzed in the 2015 CIDI resolution plans including:[57]

The assumption that the CIDI must fail.
The cause of CIDI failure must be a core business loss or impairment.
At least one "multiple acquirer strategy" is required in the plan.
A deep level of granularity is expected in the plan.
Sales strategies must be feasible and supported by considerable acquirer detail.
A detailed financial and liquidity analysis is needed.
Key legal issues must be considered.
Resolution obstacles must be addressed.
The CIDI must be insolvent at the start of resolution.

Insured products[edit]




Example of FDIC insurance coverage


FDIC deposit insurance covers deposit accounts, which, by the FDIC definition, include:

demand deposits (checking accounts of a type that formerly could not legally pay interest), and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts (NOW accounts, i.e., savings accounts that have check-writing privileges)
savings accounts and money market deposit accounts (MMDAs, i.e., higher-interest savings accounts subject to check-writing restrictions)
time deposits including certificates of deposit (CDs)
outstanding cashier's checks, interest checks, and other negotiable instruments drawn on the accounts of the bank.
accounts denominated in foreign currencies[59]

Accounts at different banks are insured separately. All branches of a bank are considered to form a single bank. Also, an Internet bank that is part of a brick and mortar bank is not considered to be a separate bank, even if the name differs. Non-US citizens are also covered by FDIC insurance as long as their deposits are in a domestic office of an FDIC-insured bank.[59]
The FDIC publishes a guide entitled "Your Insured Deposits",[60] which sets forth the general characteristics of FDIC deposit insurance, and addresses common questions asked by bank customers about deposit insurance.[61]
Items not insured[edit]
Only the above types of accounts are insured. Some types of uninsured products, even if purchased through a covered financial institution, are:[61]

Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds including money funds

The Securities Investor Protection Corporation, a separate institution chartered by Congress, provides protection against the loss of many types of such securities in the event of a brokerage failure, but not against losses on the investments.
Further, as of September 19, 2008, the United States Treasury is offering an optional insurance program for money market funds, which guarantees the value of the assets.[62]
Exceptions have occurred, such as the FDIC bailout of bondholders of Continental Illinois.


Investments backed by the U.S. government, such as Treasury securities
The contents of safe deposit boxes.

Even though the word deposit appears in the name, under federal law a safe deposit box is not a deposit account – it is merely a secured storage space rented by an institution to a customer.


Losses due to theft or fraud at the institution.

These situations are often covered by special insurance policies that banking institutions buy from private insurance companies.


Accounting errors.

In these situations, there may be remedies for consumers under state contract law, the Uniform Commercial Code, and some federal regulations, depending on the type of transaction.


Insurance and annuity products, such as life, auto and homeowner's insurance.

^ Around 491 commercial banks failed in 1893, and 243 between 1907-8.[9]
^ The latter plan was to insure all deposits up to $10,000 ($179,030), 75 percent of all deposits over $10,000 to $50,000 ($895,149), and 50 percent of anything over $50,000. Brackets indicate amount taking into account consumer price inflation from 1934.[15]
