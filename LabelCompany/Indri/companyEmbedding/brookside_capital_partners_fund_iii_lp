PRESS RELEASE
Brookside Mezzanine Partners is pleased to announce the closing of its third fund, Brookside Mezzanine Fund III, L.P. (“Fund III”), at $250 million, well in excess of its $225 million target.  Fund III will continue the same investment strategy of its two predecessor funds by providing subordinated debt, unitranche and minority equity capital in support of leveraged buyouts, strategic acquisitions, recapitalizations and growth initiatives for leading small and mid-sized companies throughout the United States.  
“We are very pleased with the strong support our existing investor base and new limited partners have shown Fund III,” said David Buttolph, Founder and Co-Manager of Brookside Mezzanine Partners.  “With this latest fund, Brookside Mezzanine Partners now has in excess of $500 million in assets under management.  We look forward to continuing our strategy of investing capital in the lower-middle market where we believe we can continue to achieve the strongest returns for our limited partners.”  The investor base of Fund III consists of family offices, entrepreneurs and institutional investors. 
Corey Sclar, Co-Manager of Brookside Mezzanine Partners added, “Since our founding in 2001, we have strived to be a value-added, solutions-based partner in every transaction.  Our investment team’s extensive and complementary experience lending and investing in the middle market across various market cycles allows us to find the right capital solution for our partners.”
Brookside Mezzanine Partners’ investments are diversified by both industry and geography and  the Firm has over a decade of experience within the manufacturing, business services, restaurant/retail and healthcare sectors.  We take a long-term, partnership-based approach to our mezzanine investments and will invest up to $20 million per transaction, with the resources to complete larger transactions as well.
