It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

        Here's Why Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Stock Fell Today

What happenedShares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: INO), a clinical-stage biotech with a focus on cancer and infectious diseases, fell 13.4% during Wednesday's session. An announcement on Tuesday that outlined an upcoming share offering didn't sit well with the market.So what 
Without any approved drugs to sell, Inovio needs to fund its operations with debt or equity. Although there wasn't any long-term debt on the company's balance sheet, it decided to visit the equity tap once again. The company intends to raise a combined $88.25 million from the public and the offering's underwriters, which at today's closing price, would raise its outstanding share count roughly 17% higher.Image source: Getty Images.Raising equity to fund new drug development is standard practice in this industry, but Inovio has been doing it for a long time. Inovio's share count has risen about 580% over the past decade, which means long-term shareholders' slice of any future profits has been reduced to a tiny sliver.Now whatInovio sparked a rally in May after announcing positive early-stage results for its experimental HIV vaccine. More recently, news that the FDA would allow the company's only late-stage clinical trial to continue lifted the stock a bit further.
Beyond these two, the company has more candidates in clinical-stage development than most biotechs several times its size, which isn't cheap. Inovio recorded research and development expenses of $24.5 million during the first three months of the year alone.The company received about $10.4 million in the form of grants and collaboration revenue, but it still burned through $23.1 million during the first quarter. Adding the likely proceeds of this upcoming share offering to whatever remains of the $100.7 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet at the end of March will lengthen its runway somewhat. Until Inovio has an application ready to submit to the FDA, though, investors should remain braced for more share offerings ahead.

Expert Comments:










DNA-Based Compound Shuts Down Seasonal Flu in Preclinical Study
				(7/19/17)

			    		A U.S. biotech developing vaccines to fight a number of infectious diseases has generated promising preclinical results with a platform therapy targeting influenza, and expects to enter the clinic with a similar platform compound targeting Ebola in 2018.

      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(7/7/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the publication of data from a preclinical study of the company's plasmid DNA-encoded monoclonal antibody (dMAb) to protect against influenza infections. Results showed that a single dose of two dMAb products targeting influenza A and B provided complete protection in mice from a lethal challenge with multiple viruses. . .These dMab products are in contrast to DNA vaccines, which would incite the production of antibodies through the immune system. . .while a dMAb product could provide immediate and short-term protection, a DNA vaccine may provide long-term immune memory and protection; thus, these two categories of approaches may complement each other."
		
		
















Phase 3 Trial for Inovio's VGX-3100 in Cervical Dysplasia Gets FDA Go-Ahead
				(6/14/17)

			    		Now that the FDA has lifted its clinical hold on Phase 3 study of Inovio Pharmaceutical's immunotherapy for cervical dysplasia, three analysts are making note of what the progress means for both the company and investors.

      Charles Duncan, Piper Jaffray & Co.
  

(6/8/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the clinical hold has been lifted on its VGX-3100 cervical dysplasia program and it will now begin enrolling patients in the Phase III REVEAL studies. . .the late-stage progress in cervical dysplasia also prompts us to take a "glass half full" approach to valuing the deeper pipeline, as we have confidence early-stage efforts can eventually move into later-stage, value-creating trials as well. We are moving to Overweight and taking our PT up to $14. . .we are supportive of this update, as we think it should diversify risk without adding to the time or capital requirements."

		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(6/8/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that the FDA has removed the clinical hold regarding the company�s Cellectra�  5PSP delivery device, and the company has started the Phase 3 pivotal study of VGX-3100. . .we note that VGX-3100 is the first candidate within the company's extensive pipeline to enter a pivotal study, and is the first immunotherapy and non-surgical treatment for high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. In the wake of this update, we reiterate our Buy rating."
		
		












  
      Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group
  

(6/8/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that the clinical hold on the Phase III program evaluating VGX-3100 for the treatment of cervical dysplasia has been lifted and the company will immediately begin
enrolling patients. . .while Inovio has continued to advance multiple earlier-stage DNA-based immunotherapies forward, providing incremental catalysts for the stock, our focus has remained on the start of the Phase III program for VGX-3100 in high-grade cervical dysplasia. . .VGX-3100 is the key driver of Inovio. With the clinical hold now lifted, Inovio has transformed into a pivotal
company."
		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(6/2/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced the second collaboration study involving the company�s INO-5401 T-cell activating immunotherapy. . .Genentech, a member of Roche Holding AG, will supply Tecentriq to be used in combination with INO-5401 and INO-9012 in an open-label Phase 1b/2 trial in patients with advanced bladder cancer. . .Inovio's immunotherapy may provide a viable option to those who have failed chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. . .we believe both studies with INO-5401 could report results in 2018. In the wake of this update, we reiterate our Buy rating and $13 price target."
		
		












  
      Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group
  

(6/1/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced a collaboration with Roche to evaluate their DNA-based immunotherapies INO-5401 (multiple cancer
antigens) and INO-9012 (IL-12 immune stimulator) with Tecentriq (PD-L1 checkpoint) in advanced bladder cancer. The P1b/2 study will enroll 80 patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma), including many patients that have previously failed checkpoint monotherapy. . .Inovio's DNA-based
immunotherapies have demonstrated robust multi-layered immune responses across multiple indications. As such we see Inovio playing a significant role in advancing the utility of checkpoints across larger cancer populations."

				(5/17/17)

			    		Inovio Pharmaceuticals' pipeline of vaccine and immunotherapeutic products is advancing steadily through the phases of development, with a host of milestones anticipated in 2017, including the start of a Phase 3 trial in cervical dysplasia and the initiation of trials with partners in brain cancer and cancers caused by human papillomavirus.

More Expert Comments




  Zacks Equity Research 

(5/26/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. shares have rallied 12% since the company announced that its HIV vaccine evoked almost 100% immune response rates in a clinical study. . .Inovio�s share price has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry in the past one year. . . .94% evaluated participants demonstrated an env specific antibody response. These responses were not observed in any of the participants treated with a placebo. . .the government-sponsored study conducted by Inovio and its collaborators was funded through a $25 million NIAID contract awarded in 2009 with an additional grant of $16 million in 2015 for the development of a HIV vaccine."
		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(5/25/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals announced that its HIV vaccine,
PENNVAX-GP, had produced an antibody (humoral) immune response
as well as a T cell (cellular) immune response in a Phase 1 trial in healthy and uninfected adults. . .these early results are very encouraging but not surprising, as they are in line with results from the company's trials of other DNA vaccines, including Ebola, Zika and MERS. . .we believe further studies would be conducted
to determine whether PENNVAX-GP can safely and effectively prevent
HIV infection.
		
		









  The Motley Fool 

(5/24/17)

		
		"Shares of Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. gained as much as 38% today due to a positive early-stage readout for its experimental HIV vaccine called Pennvax-GP. . .this experimental HIV vaccine just produced some of the strongest immune responses ever observed in a human clinical trial. . .if Inovio can capture even a sliver of this multi-billion-dollar market, it would be a ginormous win for shareholders, especially in light of the company's present market cap of only $657 million. . .Inovio may be able to monetize this promising clinical asset sooner, rather than later. Stay tuned."
		
		












  
      Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group
  

(5/24/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that PENNVAX-GP, a DNA-based HIV vaccine, demonstrated 100% immune response rates in healthy subjects, including both T cell and B cell (antibody) responses. . .the immune responses demonstrated by PENNVAX-GP are
among the highest responses shown for an HIV vaccine. . .Inovio now has a more clear path forward in the HIV space and the stage is set for a larger clinical program. . . we are focused on the VGX-3100 program and the start of the P3 program in cervical dysplasia, which we expect in mid-2017."
		
		












  
      Charles Duncan, Piper Jaffray & Co.
  

(5/18/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s INO-3112 can induce a T-cell response in a small group of HPV-associated H&N cancers. We see this as positive proof-of-concept data for the mechanistic rationale underlying Inovio's platform technology, but we appear a long way from late-stage clinical efficacy data in this and other tumor types. . .we expect Medimmune to begin an open-label Phase II study of �0457 + durvalumab in 2Q17."

		
		












  
      Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group
  

(5/11/17)

		
		"The key driver for Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc., in our view, remains VGX-3100. . .the company announced that Medimmune has initiated a combination study of MEDIO457 (VGX-3100 + IL-12) and durvalumab (PD-L1) in metastatic head and neck cancer. Inovio also initiated a P2 program of VGX-3100 in vulvar precancer. . .Inovio continues to advance multiple immunotherapy studies forward, which should provide incremental catalysts for the stock as data emerges."
		
		









  Zacks Equity Research 

(5/11/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s VGX-3100, an HPV immunotherapy, is the most advanced candidate in the company�s pipeline that is being developed for the treatment of HPV-16/18-related high-grade cervical dysplasia. . .in Apr 2017, Inovio has submitted a complete response to the FDA for the initiation of phase III study on VGX-3100 for HPV-related high grade cervical dysplasia, which was placed on clinical hold in Oct 2016. . .the company started a phase II study to evaluate the efficacy of VGX-3100 in women with HPV-related vulvar neoplasia. This is an indication with orphan status potential."
		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.
  

(5/11/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. has submitted a complete response to the FDA, which includes extensive testing and validation data of its Cellectra 5PSP delivery device developed for the Phase 3 study and future commercial use. If the FDA finds the information in this submission satisfactory to lift the clinical hold, Inovio could start the Phase 3 pivotal study of VGX-3100 for the treatment of HPV-16/18-related high grade cervical dysplasia in this quarter. . .VGX-3100 would be the first candidate within the company�s extensive pipeline to  enter a pivotal study."
		
		












  
      Charles Duncan, Piper Jaffray & Co.
  

(5/11/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported 1Q17 financial results, ending the quarter with $90M in cash. We believe current cash funds the pipeline to mid�18, and see the main value-creating events as initiation of the Phase III in cervical dysplasia and data in HIV and Zika later this year."
		
		









  Zacks Equity Research 

(4/12/17)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. recently reported positive preliminary results from the expanded stage of its phase I study, EBOV-001. The study was conducted to evaluate the company's Ebola DNA vaccine, INO-4212. The company has enrolled an additional 125 patients in the study. . .the EBOV-001 study demonstrated robust immune responses with favorable safety profile in expanded clinical study. It showed that 95% of the subjects generated an Ebola-specific antibody immune response with the mean antibody titer superior to those reported from viral vector-based Ebola vaccines. . .the company was awarded a $45 million grant by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in 2015 to lead a collaborative team for the development of multiple treatment and prevention approaches for Ebola."
		
		












  
      Ram Selvaraju, H.C. Wainwright & Co.

		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. is basically dominating the human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven cancer and cervical dysplasia space. We expect Inovio's DNA-based immunotherapy VGX-3100 will enter a Phase 3 trial by mid-2016 for cervical dysplasia, a precancerous condition detected by Pap smear. . .VGX-3100 vaccine therapy has been able to reverse cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in women with CIN-2 and CIN-3. The Phase 2 trial that we got the readout on in July 2014 showed that VGX-3100 can revert the condition to CIN-1 or no disease at all, and clear the virus from the tissues. We saw Phase 2 proof of concept that this condition can be reversed. . .Inovio is also using VGX-3100 with an immune activator called interleukin-12 (IL-12). This candidate is called INO-3112 (VGX-3100 + DNA-based IL-12 cytokine), and was partnered to Medimmune (a division of AstraZeneca) back in the summer in a deal that could be worth over $700M, plus double-digit royalties. This deal includes an upfront payment of $27.5M. INO-3112 is now in Phase 1 studies, and we've seen some compelling data in cervical cancer, as well as in head-and-neck cancer. Inovio has established a relationship to develop INO-3112 with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, which is the biggest cancer organization in Europe. . ."

The trial is expected to initiate by 2015E. . .this vaccine development update once again reflects the capital efficient approach of Inovio to move its multiple pipeline projects forward."
		
		












  
      Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group
  

(11/9/15)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported Q3/15 with revenues of $24M, which includes $15M of the upfront payment ($27M total) from MedImmune. The company reported EPS of $0.08 and ended the period with $171M in cash, which should be sufficient to fund operations into 2018."

(9/23/15)

		
		"We remodeled VGX-3100, Inovio's DNA immunotherapy for HPV-driven cancers and pre-cancers (cervical dysplasia), which includes INO-3112. INO-3112, a combination of VGX-3100 and DNA-based IL-12 is now partnered to MedImmune. Our model reflects all the milestones, the payments associated with those milestones, and the royalty structure that could be achieved in the market for human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven head-and-neck cancers. We have seen such compelling data from VGX-3100 in cervical dysplasia caused by HPV that we felt comfortable reducing the discount rate used to model free cash flow. We have seen robust immune responses that include histological regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-2/3 back to CIN-1 or better�essentially healthy cells with no dysplasia. That also made us comfortable walking down the discount rate. These factors could potentially drive the stock price higher. . .we believe that Inovio is going to start its Phase 3 trial with VGX-3100 in cervical dysplasia. INO-3112 will also get going. In addition, we expect data from the company's Ebola consortium and the Phase 1 trial in healthy volunteers, as well as data on other pipeline projects. . ."

		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. recently announced the publication of Phase 2b trial results of VGX-3100 in treating women with high grade cervical neoplasia against the human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 in a peer-reviewed article in The Lancet. Inovio's VGX-3100 is the first therapy to demonstrate that activated killer T cells induced in the body have the power to clear neoplastic lesions as well as the virus. It could present a safe and non-surgical therapeutic option for CIN2/3."

		"DARPA exercised its option to provide an additional $24M (of the $45M total award value) to the Invoio Pharmaceuticals Inc.-led international consortium to develop novel therapeutics for Ebola. . .bottom line. Inovio continues to bring in additional nondilutive funding, which offsets operating expenses. While the company is developing multiple DNA-based vaccines for infectious diseases and oncology, it is also developing a portfolio of dMAbs against infectious diseases including ebola, dengue, influenza and drug-resistant bacteria."
		
		












  
      Charles Duncan, Piper Jaffray & Co.
  

(9/21/15)

		
		"DARPA has opted to provide $24M in additional ongoing reimbursement as part of its three-year, $45M Ebola grant announced in April. The $24M was contingent on progress in Invoio Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Ebola program, which includes a therapeutic DNA mAb and DNA-based vaccine (INO-4212). Inovio has completed enrollment of the Phase 1 INO-4212 trial in 75 healthy volunteers, with interim safety and immunogenicity expected in Q4/15, and has completed monkey studies demonstrating full protection from Ebola challenge. We believe the option exercise provides validation for this early program and key funding, and we note positive progress on DNA mAb technology in Ebola may facilitate progress on a broader set of indications. . .we reiterate our Overweight rating and $31/share target."

(8/10/15)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced Q2/15 financials and a partnership with AstraZeneca worth up to $700M ($27.5M upfront plus potential development, regulatory and commercialization milestones) plus tiered double-digit royalties on sales. The partnership covers the development and commercialization of the company's human papillomavirus (HPV) immunotherapy INO-3112 (VGX-3100 plus IL-12 DNA) for cancer indications, while Inovio retains full rights for pre-cancer development. . .this further enhances our confidence in Inovio's DNA immunotherapy, and we reiterate our Overweight rating and $31 price target."
		
		









  Thomas Shrader, Stifel Nicolaus 

(8/10/15)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced a broad partnership with MedImmune to develop INO-3112 in combination with MedImmune's collection of immune-oncology molecules. . .MedImmune will fund development, allowing Inovio to leverage its cash to pursue its broad vaccine portfolio, which still includes VGX-3100 in pre-cancer. The company also reported a Q2/15 cash balance of $154M that does not include the $27.5M upfront payment as part of the MedImmune deal. We believe Inovio's potential reach into oncology based on DNA-based vaccines coupled with delivery of IL-12 is nearly unlimited. . .this deal with reasonable economics and a partner with very broad experience in the vaccine space makes sense."
		
		









  Jason McCarthy, Maxim Group 

(8/10/15)

		
		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. ended Q2/15 with $155M cash and is funded through 2018. Concurrent with reported earnings was the announcement of a partnership with MedImmune (division of AstraZeneca) for INO-3112 for the treatment of human papillomavirus(HPV)-driven cancers. MedImmune will make a $27.5M upfront payment, and Inovio could receive up to $700M in milestones as well as double-digit royalties. . .the partnership with MedImmune is the second big pharmaceutical deal for the company and is further validation of the potential of DNA-based vaccines and thus VGX-3100 to target HPV-related diseases. The VGX-3100 platform is turning into an HPV franchise for Inovio."

		"Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced that animals injected with DNA-based monoclonal antibody (dMAb) targeting dengue virus (causes hemorrhagic fever) had 100% survival following lethal challenge. While this is only preclinical data, combined with DARPA support for dMAbs targeting multiple infectious diseases (including Ebola), it changes how we can think about MAbs. . .DMAbs could be a disruptive technology for antibody-based therapeutics, a $50B market today, which includes blockbuster traditional MAbs like Keytruda, Yervoy, Humira and Remicade, to name a few."

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

PhRMA’s member companies are on the leading edge of personalized medicine development– an area that is transforming health care, improving patient outcomes and creating health system efficiencies. In a new video, Dr. Bernie Zeiher, president of development of Astellas, discusses his excitement around the promise of personalized medicine, which uses diagnostic tools to help assess the medical treatments and procedures that may be best for each patient.
“I am very optimistic about the future because the promise of personalized medicine has begun to be seen,” Dr. Zeiher says in the video. “Now, with more personalized-type therapies, you can test the tumor or test the blood to determine that in fact the person has a particular mutation, and then that will guide which therapy you would choose and it also increases the likelihood that the patient will respond.”
Dr. Zeiher’s enthusiasm reflects the commitment of America’s biopharmaceutical companies to the development of these targeted treatments. Although there were only 13 FDA-approved personalized medicines in 2006, today there are more than 140. Additionally, personalized medicines accounted for more than 25 percent of FDA approvals last year, marking a record year for these innovative therapies.
Cancer is an area where personalized medicines are having a particularly big impact, driving tremendous advances for patients with highly aggressive cancers, like non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In fact, research has shown nearly two-thirds of NSLCs have a genetic mutation that can be more effectively targeted with a personalized medicine.
Thanks to the hard work of biopharmaceutical researchers, like Dr. Zeiher, 42 percent of medications currently in the pipeline have the potential to be personalized. While the science has never been more complex, the future of research is bright with personalized medicine becoming a reality.

Finding lifesaving medicines is a life's work – the work of 140,000 researchers who never say never. As well as the millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like advancements in personalized medicine and immunotherapy – and it's coming faster than we can imagine.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
