CFP® 
The CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™, CFP® and federally registered CFP (with flame design) marks (collectively, the "CFP® marks") are professional certification marks granted in the United States by Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. ("CFP Board").

The CFP® certification is a voluntary certification; no federal or state law or regulation requires financial planners to hold CFP® certification.  It is recognized in the United States and a number of other countries for its (1) high standard of professional education; (2) stringent code of conduct and standards of practice and (3) ethical requirements that govern professional engagements with clients.  Currently, more than 62,000 individuals have obtained CFP® certification in the United States.
 
To attain the right to use the CFP® marks, an individual must satisfactorily fulfill the following requirements:     •Education – Complete an advanced college-level course of study addressing the financial planning subject areas that CFP Board’s studies have determined as necessary for the competent and professional delivery of financial planning services, and attain a Bachelor’s Degree from a regionally accredited United States college or university (or its equivalent from a foreign university).  CFP Board’s financial planning subject areas include insurance planning and risk management, employee benefits planning, investment planning, income tax planning, retirement planning and estate planning.
      •Examination – Pass the comprehensive CFP® Certification Examination.  The examination, administered in 10 hours over a two-day period, includes case studies and client scenarios designed to test one’s ability to correctly diagnose financial planning issues and apply one’s knowledge of financial planning to real world circumstances.
     •Experience – Complete at least three years of full-time financial planning-related experience (or the equivalent, measured as 2,000 hours per year).     •Ethics – Agree to be bound by CFP Board’s Standards of Professional Conduct, a set of documents outlining the ethical and practice standards for CFP® professionals.
 
Individuals who become certified must complete the following ongoing education and ethics requirements in order to maintain the right to continue to use the CFP® marks:         •Continuing Education – Complete 30 hours of continuing education hours every two years, including two hours on the Code of Ethics and other parts of the Standards of Professional Conduct, to maintain competence and keep up with developments in the financial planning field.     •Ethics – Renew an agreement to be bound by the Standards of Professional Conduct.  The Standards prominently require that CFP® professionals provide financial planning services at a fiduciary standard of care.  This means CFP® professionals must provide financial planning services in the best interests of their clients.  CFP® professionals who fail to comply with the above standards and requirements may be subject to CFP Board’s enforcement process, which could result in suspension or permanent revocation of their CFP® certification.

Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. owns the certification marks CFP®, CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ and federally registered CFP (with flame design) in the U.S., which it awards to individuals who successfully complete CFP Board’s initial and ongoing certification requirements.

Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and "best-efforts" basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.04. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. We reserve the right to change the use of
proceeds, provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies that
are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that event are
indicated in an amended prospectus reflecting the same. There is no assurance
that we will raise the full $80,000 as anticipated.

Gross proceeds                  $40,000 (50%)       $60,000 (75%)      $80,000 (100%)

Net proceeds                   $        32,000     $        52,000     $        72,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Olaf Robak, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the
proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business
plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Robak will not be paid any compensation or
anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Robak. Mr. Robak will be repaid from
revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


The level of competition in office chair products distribution business is
extremely high. Many of our established competitors have developed a brand
following which would make our potential customers prefer their office chair
products over ours. Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our
competitors would make it difficult for us to continue to enter the market.
Economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors
to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of office chair products which
would leave us at a disadvantage. The principal competitive factors in our
industry are pricing and quality of goods. We will be in a market where we
compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar
products. We will be in direct competition with them. Many large companies will
be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers. Many of
these companies may have a greater, more established customer base than us. We
will likely lose business to such companies. Also, many of these companies will
be able to afford to offer better price for similar product than us which may
also cause us to lose business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from
new market entrants. We may be unable to continue to compete effectively with
these existing or new competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.

Asset Solutions Inc. has entered the market and have one customer who has placed
two orders for our products. Since we have entered the market, we are one of
many participants in the business of distributing office chair products. Many
established, yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of
distribution such products. Nearly all Asset Solutions Inc.'s competitors have
significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial
capabilities than Asset Solutions Inc. We are, consequently, at a significant
competitive disadvantage in the market.


Company Description
Asset Solutions Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 26, 2015
and established a fiscal year end of May 31. We do have initial revenues, have
hard assets (office in Poland) and have incurred net profits since inception. We
are a development-stage company formed to continue


 operations in the
distribution of office chair products. We have recently started our operation.
As of today, we have developed our business plan, purchased our office in
Poland, and executed a Marketing and Sales Distribution Agreement with our
suppliers: Guangzhou Yuhan Office Supplies Co., Ltd., HAOCHENG CO., LTD.,
Wenzhou LINGFENG ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGY Co., Ltd. and YICHUANG INDUSTRY LIMITED,
dated March 27th, April 2nd, April 13th. 
 
We plan to expand our marketing and distribution of an assortment of office
chair products. Our products are offered at prices marked-up from 15% to 20% of
our cost. Our customers are asked to pay us 100% in advance. We fill placed
orders and supply the products within a period of thirty days (30) days or less
following receipt of any written order. We do not currently offer any credit
terms relating to order payments. Our customers are asked to pay us 100% in
advance. Customers have two options to pay for products: by wire transfer or by
sending a check/money order. If customer decides to pay by check/money order,
then we apply a certain amount of days before shipping to have the check/money
order cleared. Customers are responsible to cover the shipping costs.  Since we
generally have a 30-day period to process/fill orders, we do not purchase
inventory in advance, but rather ship directly from supplier to customer. We do
not store inventory for any period of time. The orders are shipped to the
customers upon customers' requests. Customers are responsible for the custom
duties, taxes, insurance or any other additional charges that are incurred.

Welcome
Today, automobiles, cell phones, computers, televisions, along 
			with most other everyday electronic devices contain chips manufactured from 
			semiconductor wafers. After the devices in a semiconductor wafer 
			have been fabricated, they must be connected together to perform 
			circuit functions. This connection process is called metallization 
			and is commonly performed utilizing Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) 
			equipment. During the course of the metallization process, PVD equipment 
			components are consumed and must be refurbished, or replaced to insure 
			optimum equipment performance. 
ASSET Solutions supports semiconductor device manufacturers with second source 
			spare parts and services having a primary focus on PVD equipment. Our 
			customers rely on our products and services to reduce equipment cost of ownership 
			and achieve optimum equipment performance.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 02/17/2006
            

                BBB has determined that Total Asset Solutions, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
