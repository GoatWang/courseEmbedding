 Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption.

Negative exposures may represent short positions through derivatives.The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell a security. Large concentrations can increase share price volatility.Source: Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The S&P 500� Index is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. The index includes 500 leading companies and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization.Price/earnings for a stock is the ratio of the company's most recent month-end share price to the company's estimated earnings per share (EPS) for the current fiscal year. If a third-party estimate for the current year EPS is not available, Morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported EPS and average historical earnings growth rates. Price/ earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the Morningstar Style Box. For portfolios, this historical P/E data point is calculated by taking an asset-weighted average of the earnings yields (E/P) of all the stocks in the portfolio and then taking the reciprocal of the result.

An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark. In order to compare funds across general asset classes, Morningstar calculates R-squared values relative to a "standard" broad-based market index. For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index. Thus, the "standard" broad-based market index used by Morningstar may differ from the fund's actual benchmark stated in this factsheet.

Dreyfus, established in 1951 and headquartered in New York City, is an American investment manager of investment products and strategies. The company merged with Mellon Financial in 1994, and then became a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon when Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York merged in 2007.
As a BNY Mellon company, Dreyfus provides access to its global network of asset managers, delivering investment insight and products — equity, fixed income, global/international and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies, asset allocation solutions and brokerage services. Dreyfus products are delivered through a variety of distribution channels: intermediary (advisor-sold), institutional, and retail direct.
History[edit]
The firm's origin dates back to 1947, when investor Jack Dreyfus founded a brokerage house in New York City named Dreyfus & Co.[2][3]
In 1951, attracted by the concept of mutual funds, Dreyfus & Co. purchased a small management company named John G. Nesbett & Co., Inc. with a small common stock fund called The Nesbett Fund Incorporated. Nesbett & Co. was renamed The Dreyfus Corporation, and The Nesbett Fund became The Dreyfus Fund Incorporated.[2][3]
Going public in 1965, Dreyfus was among the first money management firms to tap into the stock market for additional capital.[2][3]
In 1976, Dreyfus was among the first fund companies to introduce an incorporated tax-exempt municipal bond fund.[2][3]
In 1994, Dreyfus completed its landmark merger with Mellon Bank Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger, a milestone in the history of financial services in the United States, was at the time the largest-ever combination of a bank and mutual fund company.[4][2][3]
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation merged to form a new company The Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's largest global asset management and serving company. The reach of Dreyfus' distribution capabilities now extends to the resources of BNY Mellon and its exclusive network of institutional asset managers.[2][3]

Dreyfus, established in 1951 and headquartered in New York City, is an American investment manager of investment products and strategies. The company merged with Mellon Financial in 1994, and then became a subsidiary of Bank of New York Mellon when Mellon Financial and The Bank of New York merged in 2007.
As a BNY Mellon company, Dreyfus provides access to its global network of asset managers, delivering investment insight and products — equity, fixed income, global/international and money market mutual funds, separately managed accounts, retirement and cash management strategies, asset allocation solutions and brokerage services. Dreyfus products are delivered through a variety of distribution channels: intermediary (advisor-sold), institutional, and retail direct.
History[edit]
The firm's origin dates back to 1947, when investor Jack Dreyfus founded a brokerage house in New York City named Dreyfus & Co.[2][3]
In 1951, attracted by the concept of mutual funds, Dreyfus & Co. purchased a small management company named John G. Nesbett & Co., Inc. with a small common stock fund called The Nesbett Fund Incorporated. Nesbett & Co. was renamed The Dreyfus Corporation, and The Nesbett Fund became The Dreyfus Fund Incorporated.[2][3]
Going public in 1965, Dreyfus was among the first money management firms to tap into the stock market for additional capital.[2][3]
In 1976, Dreyfus was among the first fund companies to introduce an incorporated tax-exempt municipal bond fund.[2][3]
In 1994, Dreyfus completed its landmark merger with Mellon Bank Corporation, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation. The merger, a milestone in the history of financial services in the United States, was at the time the largest-ever combination of a bank and mutual fund company.[4][2][3]
On July 1, 2007, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. and Mellon Financial Corporation merged to form a new company The Bank of New York Mellon, one of the world's largest global asset management and serving company. The reach of Dreyfus' distribution capabilities now extends to the resources of BNY Mellon and its exclusive network of institutional asset managers.[2][3]
