Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals Inc., a drug development company formerly called Star Scientific Inc., has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation rather than try to reorganize its finances.
The Sarasota, Fla.-based company, which had moved its headquarters in June 2014 from Henrico County, reported total assets of $35,139 and total liabilities of $21.31 million, according to its voluntary petition filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware on Tuesday.
Its two wholly owned subsidiaries - RCP Development Inc. and Star Tobacco Inc. - also filed for Chapter 7.
RCP Development reported total assets of $31,308 and total liabilities of $51.957 million, while Star Tobacco reported total assets of $482,289 and total liabilities of $12.254 million.
Shares in the publicly traded company had been trading at a penny for much of the past three months until the filing this week.
The company's founder and former CEO, Jonnie R. Williams Sr., was involved in a gifts corruption scandal that resulted in the convictions of former Gov. Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen. The case against the former governor was overturned, and charges for both of them have been dropped.
Williams stepped down as an executive with Star Scientific in late 2013 and voluntarily resigned as an employee effective Aug. 15, 2014.
In June 2014, Star Scientific changed its name to Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals, replaced most of its board of directors and top management, and moved its headquarters.
Two months later, the company suspended sales of its supplement Anatabloc after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had warned that it was marketing the supplement in violation of federal regulations. Rock Creek also suspended sales of its other dietary supplement, called CigRx.
Rock Creek had been selling Anatabloc on its website since August 2011 and at retailer GNC since early 2012.
The company had promoted Anatabloc as having anti-inflammatory properties and obtained endorsements from professional athletes who said the product helped them with muscle soreness.
The company also suggested that the active ingredient in Anatabloc - a compound called anatabine that can be derived from tobacco - might help in recovery from traumatic brain injury.
It said the product may help reduce inflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease, reduce the severity of ulcerative colitis, and could be effective in treatment of multiple sclerosis.
