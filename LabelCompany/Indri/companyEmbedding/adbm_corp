Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

About ADBM
Advanced DB Master is a database management product which combines ease of use with power and speed. This product was originally written for the Apple II in 1979 and was migrated to DOS platforms in 1983. After many successful years under DOS we are now shipping the 32 bit windows product for use with Windows 2000, or Windows XP, Vista 
    32 and 64 bit, Windows 7 32 and 64 bit.  Go to the ADBM Downloads page for info on the demo version.

System Requirements: 256-512 megabytes ram.

For further information check the topics below.

Information for users of the DOS product

Specifications
This version of Advanced DB Master is ODBC compatible. That means you can share information between databases created with Advanced DB Master and databases created with other ODBC compatible products like Microsoft Access. You can even attach tables from other products to your ADBM database. And Advanced DB Master's storage limitations are much more generous than most other popular database products, for example each record in a table can be up to 32 kilobytes in size. Take a look at the other specifications below:

Advanced DB Master 7 Database and Table Limits


250 tables in a Database 
	
4,000 fields in a Table 
	
10 fields in a Primary Key 
	
10 fields in a Secondary Key

250 Secondary Key indexes

Features
Advanced DB Master is packed with powerful features that make highly customizeable and and easily adaptable to specialized database needs. One good example is the image handling capability. Images can be stored internally in the database or externally as image files, and can be viewed and manipulated as part of a view or in a separate image editor window. Advanced DB Master also has built in features that help automate the process of including large amounts of images in a database. Here's a picture of an image as part of a view and also in the image editor window.


Advanced DB Master is a relational database management tool, and one feature which helps you capitalize on this is the view on a view. Any view can contain other views and the contained view can display any relational link between the two tables. For example in the view below the two files are linked on the invoice number.


Organization
Advanced DB Master for windows is even easier to navigate than the DOS version, because w've put a lot of effort into making the product easy and intuitive to use. Your main tool for organizing databases will be the Database Manager window. It provides a well organized display of all tables, views, macros and reports. From the Database Manager window you can add, delete, use or design all database components. Here's what it looks like:



This is just one example of how we've tried to pack in lots of functionality while keeping Advanced DB Master quick and easy to use. This product is full of Managers and Wizards which help you customize every aspect of your database. A good example is the View Creation Wizard whose 3 pages give you a good starting point for a new view:




We're sure that you'll love these features along with all the others we've included to make Advanced DB Master easy to use and navigate.


Information For DOS Users
Terminology Changes
For those of you already familiar with Advanced DB Master for DOS the information given here about the windows product might not make sense until you understand a couple of changes. Don't worry, not too much has changed, but we've had to update some terminology to fit with changes in the product and to keep up with the ever progressing data management industry. Hopefully this chart will make things clear.

Printing from DOS ADBM

        The following steps are required to enable printing from DOS ADVANCED DB MASTER
        under the XP operating system.


1.
        The printer must be the "DEFAULT" printer.
        From the "Start" button, run "Printers and Faxes", then
        set your printer to be the DEFAULT printer.



2.
        Copy the following three lines into a text file called
        NETUSE.BAT, in any directory you like. You can use any
        word processor or the windows programs NOTEPAD or WORDPAD.

        NET USE LPT1: /DELETE
        NET USE LPT1: \\JP32\hp5610 /persistent:yes
        REM NET USE LPT1: \\COMPUTERNAME\PRINTERNAME /persistent:yes

        Change the second line to correctly show
        your own COMPUTERNAME (instead of JP32) and
        the correct PRINTERNAME (instead of hp5610), then save the changes.

        COMPUTERNAME is located by bringing up the "My Computer" properties
        and selecting the "Computer Name" tab. Use the value given
        for "Full Computer Name".

        PRINTERNAME is located by clicking the "Start" button,
        run "Printers and Faxes", then bring up properties for
        your printer. Select the "Share" tab and use the "Share name".



3.
        Run this BAT file from a dos window. To bring up a dos
        window: from the START button, choose the "RUN" button then type
        in CMD and press OK. When the DOS window comes up, you will have
        to change the directory to the directory that contains your
        NETUSE.BAT file and then run this batch file.
        After running the batch file, your dos window should display
        the message:
        "The command completed successfully"

        Example dos commands to do this:
        C:\
        CD\mydir\xdir
        NETUSE

        These commands assume the NETUSE.BAT file is located in
        directoryC:\mydir\xdir.

        You should now be able to print from DOS ADBM.
