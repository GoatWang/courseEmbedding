                                Report abuseTranscript of Bauer HockeyBauer HockeyBauer's codesBAU.TOsic code: 509111naics code: 423910Social Responsibilities Bauer is the clear-cut leader in the hockey equipment industry. Like any other big company, they must maintain a good reputation and do so by improving their image to the public. They do little things like fundraisers and donations to keep their image and remain a leader in the industry. For example, Bauer donated equipment to youth hockey programs in Philadelphia and Boston. The marketing strategy behind this shows that they care about the game of hockey and are trying to get more kids to have the opportunity to play. Although it is seen by the public as a generous donation, Bauer really does this to get the support of future customers who think Bauer really cares about the community. Another example of this is how Bauer is campaigning to expand hockey in Canada over the next 10 years. President of Bauer hockey, Kevin Davis, quotes "As the industry leader, we feel it is our responsibility to invest the resources necessary to help propel our game to new levels". He claims that Bauer sincerely wants to grow the game of hockey so everyone has the chance to play the great sport. However, Bauer’s “social responsibility” is really driven by potential customers and keeping a good public image rather than pure generosity.Board of Director's Management TeamBauer's management team consists of two chief officer's and six vice president's of specific operations such as: Human resources, global marketing, lacrosse, and etc. Amir Rosenthal has been the Chief Financial Officer for Bauer since 2008. He has worked at many large companies such as: Katy industries, Timex Group Limited, and Sturm, Ruger & Co Inc. Rosenthal has a Bachelor of Arts from Dartmouth College, a Doctorate of Jurisprudence from New York University School of Law, and a Master of Science in Finance from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.Jake FloroMGT 101Bauer's board for directors is comprised of 9 people, all in which are currently or have been CEO's, chairman's, or on the board of other companies as well. Kevin Davis is the president, Chief Executive Officer and Director for Bauer hockey. He joined Bauer in 2002 and has increased positions over time to finally become president. Davis has Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Massachusetts and earned Certified Public Accountant and Certified Management Accountant designations.Org ChartProduct ListJob OpeningMarketingFinancesApx2 hockey stickTotal One NXG hockey stickNexus 1000 hockey stickApx2 ice skatesTotal One NXG ice skatesNexus 1000 ice skatesTotal One NXG shoulder padsApx2 hockey glovesApparel: jersey's, clothes, hats, etc.There is one job opening for Bauer in Exeter, New Hampshire for a senior business analyst. The requirements are as follows:Requirements:• Bachelor’s Degree with 5-7 years of experience in the consumer goods, wholesale industry (preferably apparel/footwear) with a minimum of 6 years of project management or 4 years of business analysis experience.  Prior consulting experience is a plus.• Prior experience evaluating business needs and translating those needs into effective business processes required.• Proven experience eliciting high-level business requirements and identifying, documenting and clearly articulating those requirements.• CCBA or CBAP certification preferred but not required in lieu of adequate experience. As you can see, this job requires a lot of education and experience in the work place. The senior business analyst is expected to set goals for the future of the company and create a plan on how to get there through their resources and other business partners.One way Bauer hockey promotes their products is through an event called BauerWorld. Basically, it goes on for a couple of days to showcase their new products and give seminars on retailer education. Throughout this event, Bauer displays their technological advancements on products through demonstration. In 2012, they had people from 23 countries attend this event. I think this is a good way to market their products because it informs the retailers everything they need to know on the product and why it is different and better from other brands products and even from older Bauer products. Marketers need to know their product in order to sell it and this is a great way to help them learn hands on.

Trusted and Guaranteed Since 1920. - JAKE NORTON
 ALPINE CLIMBING -...




































































































































TEAMS














JAKENORTONALPINE CLIMBING - GUIDEPhoto by Jeremiah WattHigh-altitude guide, U.N. ambassador, and Renaissance man devoted to the mountain causeJake Norton has a rare talent for putting a passion for the mountains and their people into powerful words and images. As a guide and respected high-altitude mountaineer, his skills are highly respected, but it’s his ability to communicate the essence of his climbing experiences that makes him one of the most inspiring climbers on our team. Climber, photographer, filmmaker, philanthropist, and inspirational speaker, this renaissance man of the mountains clearly makes a difference through his words, images, and actions.Norton has worked as a professional guide since 1993. He was part of the team that discovered the body of George Mallory on Everest in 1999, and the first person to visit and document all of the pre-World War II camps on Everest. Norton has climbed extensively throughout the Himalayas and Andes, and also retraced Sir Ernest Shackleton’s 1917 crossing of the island of South Georgia. He has summited the world’s tallest peak three times and served as the team leader for the Eddie Bauer return to the West Ridge of Mount Everest in 2012, an effort that he helped turn into the film High and Hallowed. He has participated in 30 expeditions—to Nepal, Tibet, and India—summited Denali, Kilimanjaro, Vinson, and Aconcagua, as well as made 93 trips up Mt. Rainier.His most current philanthropic mission is telling the story of mountains and their critical link to clean water, our world’s most precious resource. To that end, he co-created the 2012 award-winning film The Water Tower, has raised over $325,000 for global water and sanitation causes, and is currently co-directing and producing a film on the Ganges River in India—a source-to-sea passion project first profiled on the Live Your Adventure blog. Norton was Director of the American Mountaineering Museum in Golden, CO, serves on the International Advisory Board for The Mountain Institute, and is an Ambassador for the United Nations Mountain Partnership. He has covered assignments for Discovery Channel, PBS/NOVA, BBC, National Geographic, and Forbes. He is a proud Colorado resident.ACHIEVEMENTSDiscovered George Mallory’s body on Mt.

About-Us















H&B Packing Co., Inc. Call us: 254-752-25061HomeAbout UsContact UsProducts and DocumentsDesigned using Homestead website templates. Create a website today.H&B Packing Co., Inc. was founded in 1953 in Waco, Texas, by Henry Heyman and his son-in-law, Jake Bauer. Henry had began making sausage products several years before that in a makeshift smokehouse he had built behind his residence, and began marketing his product in the square in Downtown Waco. It wasn't long before Henry's sausage had become a favorite among local Wacoans, and he visualized being able to supply Central Texas and beyond with his products. The site chosen for this venture was just North of the Brazos River, and a very short distance from the famous Waco Suspension bridge, the crossing point of cattle and ranchers following the Chisholm Trail.  Henry and Jake's initial goal was to build a sustainable business that would be able to provide its customers with a quality product. Over 60 years later, the business model, consumer-driven goals, and our core values remain the same, and we are proud to be one of the first family-owned beef processors to still be operating in the state of Texas today.   Today, Jake Bauer and his wife Simone, are still actively involved in the day to day operations at the facility serving as President and Treasurer respectively. Their two sons, Richard and Benjy Bauer oversee the plant operations on a daily basis. Richard is the establishment's Vice President of Production, and works directly with the procurement of cattle and raw materials, while Benjy serves as the Vice President of Operations and directly manages the facility and staff with a hands on approach.    Benjy's children, Kam and Kalize Bauer are also both key pieces within the Company's infrastructure. Kam serves at the Plant Manager of the facility, while Kalize represents the family and company serving as Sales Manager.   From our family to your fork, our goal is to provide our customers and consumer base with the best that beef has to offer. We have a variety of options to choose from when it comes to our products, and you can be sure that we strive everyday to produce a safe and wholesome product for all to enjoy.                                                                                                                       Above: Henry Heyman looks over beef products, as Jake Bauer (Left center) supervises the practices and employees in the processing department.Interested in learning more about us?About H&B Packing Co., Inc.Committed to Customer Service and Producing Safe, Wholesome Products for our Consumers
