VCA Honored with Corporate Excellence Award by Western University of Health Sciences By Pet Product News Staff
 


Published: 2016.12.13 05:00 AM



VCA co-founders Robert Antin and his brother, chief operating officer, Arthur J. Antin 
Los Angeles-based VCA Inc., the largest family of animal care providers nationwide, was presented with the Western University of Health Sciences Corporate Excellence Award in Health Care at the school’s annual gala fundraiser, A Tribute to Caring. Held in Anaheim, Calif., the event attracted nearly 700 guests and raised more than $400,000 to benefit university scholarships.
WesternU honored longtime friend and partner, VCA, with the award, which was accepted by VCA co-founders Robert Antin and his brother, chief operating officer, Arthur J. Antin.
The Antin brothers and Neil Tauber, who is now senior vice president, started VCA around the time WesternU Founding President Philip Pumerantz, Ph.D. was exploring the possibility of opening of a veterinary college.
VCA supported Dr. Pumerantz as he opened the College of Veterinary Medicine, and contributed to the One Health concept, which is the integrative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment.
“The role of veterinarians in public health, as well as medicine, has gained in significance, going beyond the diseases that affect both animals and man,” said WesternU Senior Vice President Thomas G. Fox, Ph.D. “The concept of One Health and its public health significance contributes to and mandates a healthy environment, healthy animals and healthy people. Robert has always had VCA in the forefront of efforts to improve the understanding of the importance of One Health.”
WesternU College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) alumna Jaimie Siegel, DVM ’07, grew up with Antin as a neighbor. She babysat his children and, when he found out she wanted to become a veterinarian, he helped her get a job at age 16 as a kennel assistant at a VCA hospital. That early experience helped her gain a realistic view of her future profession.
Siegel continued to work for VCA while attending WesternU and completed an emergency critical care and surgery internship at VCA after earning her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. She worked at VCA for nine years before starting her own concierge practice in Hermosa Beach.
“VCA is very accepting of who you are as a person. They think about the individual more than a lot of other companies,” Siegel said. “I’m a supporter of the company—the work they do, their mission statement. VCA is about individualism. It’s about the individual client and the individual animal.”
Every CVM student takes the diagnostic, laboratory and pathology course at VCA’s Antech diagnostics laboratory in Orange County, Calif., and many VCA practices provide training opportunities to CVM students.
VCA is one of the many clinical partners in the community that supports WesternU by providing students the opportunity to work extensively with animals alongside veterinarians in the local area. After completing the four-year doctor of veterinary medicine program, students are well prepared to enter a rewarding career caring for animals as veterinarians.
