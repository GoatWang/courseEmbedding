ArtVentive Launches U.S. Commercialization

							ArtVentive Launches U.S. commercialization by Showcasing its EOS™ Device to over 800 of the Leading Vascular Surgeons and Interventional Radiologists at the 2016 Global Embolization Symposium and Technology Conference (GEST) in New York.

			Carlsbad, CA, 
			May 12, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc. commenced the launch of its flagship occlusion device product, the ArtVentive Endoluminal Occlusion System (EOS™) at the Global Embolization Symposium and Technologies (GEST) in New York, NY on May 5-8.  The introduction in the United States follows the initial commercialization in the E.U. last year.
Dr. Jafar Golzarian, MD, GEST co-founder and Director of Interventional Radiology and Vascular Imaging at the University of Minnesota presented the ArtVentive EOS™ device to a standing room only audience of over 200 vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in a session titled the “New World of Micro Plugs.”
Dr. Marc Sapoval, GEST co-chairman and Professor of Clinical Radiology and Chair of the Cardiovascular Radiology Department Georges Pompidou Hospital, Paris, France deployed the device during the demonstration at the “Master class and Materials: Coils and Plugs”.

Dr. Moelker explained that he and his team "repeatedly used ArtVentive EOS™ at Erasmus University Medical Center in our practice of embolization procedures. The ArtVentive EOS™ device has a unique ability to act immediately, instantly occluding targeted vessels. EOS™ reduces procedure time substantially compared to conventional coil insertion, decreasing the amount of radiation received by both medical personnel and patient. EOS™ has great impact on our everyday practice, significantly reducing expenses and the negative effects of use of radiation during the procedure."

Dr. Adriaan Moelker, MD, PhD, Head Section Interventional Radiology at the Department of Radiology, Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the largest interventional radiology practice in the Netherlands, described his experience as an early adapter of EOS™. His pioneering usage of the vascular occlusion device was demonstrated in multiple case studies conducted at his hospital and he reported his clinical experience and resultant benefits of using the ArtVentive EOS™ device in multiple arterial and venous applications.

Leon Rudakov, PhD, President and Chief Technology Officer of ArtVentive, commented, “This year, ArtVentive has established two Centers in the United States at George Washington University and TUFTS with interventional radiologists that are committed to assisting us in introducing our product to other professionals and hospitals. EOS™ is CE-marked and recently received FDA 510(k) approval in Q4 2015 and we are now strategically expanding our European and US operations through selecting distributors and proctoring centers.” 
“GEST 2016 provided an ideal platform for us to launch our U.S. commercialization efforts with our exposure to the top professionals in the world and the opportunity to proctor over 50 physicians with hands-on training on the use of EOS™.  ArtVentive demonstrated how EOS™ provides immediate and permanent occlusion, with key competitive advantages and clinical benefits over traditional methods and devices.  We are off to a great start in 2016 and look forward to continuing our product launch in the U.S. and expanding our EOS™ technology platform beyond peripheral vascular to other critical treatments in the rapidly growing field of interventional radiology, vascular surgery and beyond.”

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains forward-looking statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. Certain statements made in this discussion are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are projections in respect of future events or financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential," or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements made in a quarterly report on Form 10-Q may include statements about our:  �  ability to obtain sufficient capital or strategic business arrangements to fund our operations and realize our business plan;  �  belief as to whether a meaningful and profitable global market can be established for the ArtVentive Endoluminal Occlusion Devices (ArtVentive EOS(TM)) as a minimally invasive occlusion device;  �  belief that our medical device seems superior to other options;  �  expectations regarding our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our technology;  �  ability to commercialize products in light of the intellectual property rights of others;  �  ability to obtain funding for operations, inventory and scale-up of our medical devices;  �  future agreements with third parties in connection with the commercialization of our technologies;  �  size and growth potential of the markets for our product candidates, and our ability to serve those markets;  �  regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;  �  ability to contract with third-party suppliers and manufacturers and their ability to perform adequately;  �  success as it is compared to competing therapies that are or may become available;  �  ability to attract and retain key scientific or management personnel and to expand our management team;  �  accuracy of estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements, profitability, and needs for additional financing;  �  need to raise additional funds on an immediate basis which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all;  �  expenditures not resulting in commercially successful revenues; and  �  extensive industry regulation, and how that will continue to have a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.  These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the risks in the section entitled "Risk Factors" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, any one of which may cause our company's or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks may cause the Company's or its industry's actual results, levels of activity or performance to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity or performance. Moreover, neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements. The Company is under no duty to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results.  As used in this quarterly report and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "we," "us," "our," "Artventive Medical Group" or the "Company" refer to Artventive Medical Group, Inc. and its wholly-owned Subsidiary, ArtVentive Medical Group, Canada Inc., ("AMG Canada"). Unless otherwise specified, all dollar amounts are expressed in United States dollars.  Corporate Overview  ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc. is a medical device corporation focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing a family of endoluminal occlusion devices, known as the ArtVentive Endoluminal Occlusion System ("ArtVentive EOS(TM)" or "EOS(TM)"). Through our patented technology, we have developed minimally invasive occlusion devices and procedures capable of achieving immediate, complete and permanent occlusion of peripheral vasculature. We believe EOS(TM) represents a paradigm shift in the vessel occlusion marketplace, through our use of a unique technology platform that, when deployed, immediately occludes a vessel and does not depend on waiting for blood or fluids to clot around the device. We believe that this new, novel technology significantly reduces risks to both patients and doctors, is more cost effective than currently available products, and has the potential to become the standard of care in the vessel occlusion market.  The ArtVentive EOS(TM) is our proprietary technology platform which we plan to expand from peripheral vascular to neurological vascular disorders, women's contraceptive health, varicose veins, interventional oncology and cardiology procedures.  We were incorporated on January 23, 2007 in the State of Nevada as Big Bear Resources, Inc. We changed our name to Uranium Plus Resource Corporation on March 21, 2008. On January 9, 2010, we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of ArtVentive Medical Inc., a California company, and changed our name, on January 26, 2010, to ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc. to concentrate on developing, manufacturing and marketing the ArtVentive EOS(TM) family of devices.  Based on the work of Dr. Leon Rudakov, Ph.D. and Dr. Philippe Gauilloud, MD, we developed our first prototype of the ArtVentive EOS(TM) in 2010. Since inception, our activities have been focused on our corporate operations, research and development, EOS(TM) device design and testing, implementation of quality controls and protocols, animal studies, and regulatory strategy for FDA and European submissions and approvals. In December 2010, the Company formally froze the EOS(TM) device design for the peripheral category of indications in preparation for the regulatory phase and prior to commercialization in Europe, followed by the United States. We protect our technology with 10 approved patents and 27 patents pending.  We outsource certain operations to assist us in the implementation of our strategic plan to develop, manufacture and commercialize our products. These companies provided the following services:  �  Medical Murray Inc. is our manufacturer and a leader in the field of medical device development and manufacturing that is ISO certified and FDA registered.  �  Alvamed, Inc. (formerly Northwest Clinical Research Group, Inc.) develops our regulatory and clinical strategy, provides a platform of quality control and communicates with the FDA and the European Notified Body.  In September of 2010, we implemented our Quality Management System (QMS), based on the requirements of the following regulations and international standards:  �  US FDA Quality System Regulation, 21 CFR 820  �  EU Medical Device Directive (MDD), EEC 93/42  �  Canada Medical Devices Regulations (CMDR), SOR/98-282  �  ISO 13485:2003 Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems - Requirements Regulatory Purposes  We completed a comprehensive ISO Certification audit performed by BSI Product Services ("BSI"). BSI is an international ISO 9000/ISO Registrar and CE Mark notified body required for the European regulatory approval and subsequent CE Mark certification. The audit confirmed that the Company's document and quality control systems were up to ISO standards and in compliance with international requirements for the maintaining quality of the products without non-conformities.  Our common stock is currently listed on the OTC Market, Pink tier, under the symbol "AVTD".  Our Product  EOS(TM) is a minimally invasive occlusion device and procedure capable of achieving immediate, complete and permanent occlusion of peripheral vasculature. EOS(TM) is designed to be deployed into an artery, vein or tube using our patented catheter and placed precisely in the correct location to cut off blood or fluid supply immediately, completely and permanently. The EOS(TM) delivery catheter is designed to permit fast and controlled deployment, with instantaneous occlusion of the treated vessel, making it safer and more effective than other treatment modalities.  The major advantage of the ArtVentive EOS(TM) is its immediate action of occluding target sites. Most of all devices require much more time and radiation to perform the same type of procedure.  We received our CE Mark certification for EOS(TM) on May 30, 2013, and implemented the planned EOS(TM) peripheral device transfer from research and development to commercialization, marketing, and exploratory distribution throughout Europe, simultaneous to making our U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") application. The FDA granted us 510(k) clearance for the following sizes of EOS(TM) as a therapy in patients with peripheral vasculature requiring occlusion:   FDA 510(k) Clearance Granted Product/Size Commercial Introduction December 9, 2014 5mm, 8mm EOS? and Guide Catheter February 2015  In 2015, we commenced limited commercialization of our product targeting key hospitals in Europe as proctoring centers. We plan to expand our efforts in Europe and the United States in 2016 as well as expand the sizes of EOS(TM) to perform occlusions in a wider variety of vascular applications.  Recent Corporate Developments  Since the commencement of the year through September 30, 2016, we have experienced the following corporate developments:  Resignation of Directors  On April 25, 2016, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of H. James Graham as Executive Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors, effective May 31, 2016.  On July 11, 2016, the Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Christopher Thorson as a member of the Board of Directors, effective July 11, 2016.  On May 17, 2016, the Board of Directors appointed Tom Brauser a member of the Board of Directors, effective June 1, 2016. Subsequent to that on August 5, 2016, the Board of Directors accepted Mr. Brauser's resignation from the Board of Directors of the Company.  Results of Operations  Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  Revenue  We recognize revenue via the sale of the EOS(TM) device to the Company's distributors in Europe and through direct sales in the U.S. We invoice customers when products are shipped. For the three months ended September 30,  2016, our total revenues were $111,947, as compared to $49,991 for the same period in 2015, an increase of 124%. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increased sales focus of the EOS(TM) device in the US which began just prior to the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Expenses Our expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015: Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenues $ 111,947 $ 49,991 Cost of sales 53,850 49,991 Gross profit 58,097 - Research and development 70,075 599,641 Selling, general and administration 290,468 330,695 Depreciation expense 1,227 1,112 Financial expenses (income), net - (2) Net loss $ (303,673) $ (931,446)  Research and Development Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Salaries and related expenses $ 47,437 66,574 Other research and development expenses 22,638 533,067  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit was $58,097 based on both domestic and international sales, including the cost of free demos. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our gross profit was zero since the volume of unit production was not enough to achieve profitable per unit costs of sales. We expect manufacturing costs to decrease over the next twelve months with increased sales volume and the successful negotiation of a unit price cost from our manufacturing partner. Research and development costs decreased by $529,566 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from the comparative period of 2015. The decrease is due to our transitioning from the research and development stage of our product to the commercial stage. We expect research and development costs to be ongoing due to the enhancement of current products and the development of new devices.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Salaries and related expenses $ 35,186 $ 64,860 Stock-based compensation 97,500 71,835 Professional fees 54,447 107,207 Rent and related expenses 3,041 4,312 Business development 753 66,308 Other general and administrative expenses 99,541 16,173 Total $ 290,468 $ 330,695  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $40,227 from the comparative period in 2015. This was due in part to an effort by management to reduce certain general and administrative expenses and business development expenses. Professional fees decreased by $52,760 due primarily to efforts to reduce legal fees. We anticipate continued professional fees, mainly from regulatory, legal and  accounting, due to ongoing public company reporting requirements. Business development expense decreased by $65,555 due to the Company's efforts to reduce expenses and conserve cash, including decreased participation in industry shows and conferences. Other general and administrative expenses increased by $108,368 due primarily to increased use of outside services and consultants.  Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  Revenue  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total revenues were $177,066, as compared to $208,176 for the same period in 2015, a decrease of 15%. The decrease in revenue is attributable primarily to decreased sales of the EOS(TM) device to European distributors that was mainly due to a realignment of the Company's sales strategy in the European market.  Expenses Our expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Revenues $ 177,066 $ 208,176 Cost of sales 118,969 208,176 Gross profit 58,097 - Research and development 534,198 1,225,703 Selling, general and administration 972,931 1,555,793 Depreciation expense 3,681 3,337 Financial expenses (income), net - (4) Loss before income taxes $ (1,452,713) $ (2,784,829)  Research and Development Expenses Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Salaries and related expenses $ 145,428 217,327 Other research and development expenses 388,770 1,008,376  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our gross profit was $58,097 based on both domestic and international sales, including the cost of free demos. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our gross profit was zero since the volume of unit production was not enough to achieve profitable per unit costs of sales. We expect manufacturing costs to decrease over the next twelve months with increased sales volume and the successful negotiation of a unit price cost from our manufacturing partner. Research and development costs decreased by $691,505 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from the comparative period of 2015. The decrease is due to our transitioning from the research and development stage of our product to the commercial stage. We expect research and development costs to be ongoing due to the enhancement of current products and the development of new devices.  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Salaries and related expenses $ 76,175 $ 342,445 Stock-based compensation 116,500 71,835   Professional fees 270,352 354,089 Rent and related expenses 9,495 10,757 Business development 70,974 209,684 Other general and administrative expenses 429,435 566,983 Total $ 972,931 $ 1,555,793  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $582,862 from the comparative period in 2015. This was due in part to an effort by management to reduce certain general and administrative expenses and business development expenses. Salaries and related expenses decreased by $266,270 due to the reduced use of sales personnel and the realignment of the Company's sales strategy in the European market during the first quarter of 2016. We expect wages and salaries to increase substantially in the next twelve months as we expand our management, support staff and the sales team. Any increases are expected to be due to the initialization and transfer of the EOS(TM) device from research and ongoing development to commercialization. Professional fees decrease by $83,737 due primarily to efforts to reduce legal fees. Business development expense decreased by $138,710 due to the Company's efforts to reduce expenses and conserve cash, including decreased participation in industry shows and conferences. We anticipate continued professional fees, mainly from regulatory, legal and accounting, due to ongoing public company reporting requirements.  Liquidity and Financial Condition Working Capital Deficiency September 30, December 31, 2016 2015 Current assets $ 145,718 $ 354,598 Current liabilities 1,876,760 924,089 Working capital deficiency $ (1,731,042) $ (569,491)  The increase in current liabilities is mainly due to an increase in accounts payable.  Cash Flows Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 2015 Net loss $ (1,452,713) $ (2,784,829) Net cash used in operating activities (81,599) (2,745,176) Net cash used in investing activities - (5,849) Net cash provided by financing activities 90,000 2,700,000 Increase (decrease) in cash $ 8,401 $ (51,025)  As of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $30,182.  Net cash used in operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $81,599, mainly due to the net loss of $1,402,713 that was incurred during the period.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $90,000, due to sales of common stock for cash.  Private Placement Offering  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold 90,000 common shares to private investors for proceeds of $90,000.  Going Concern  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on Form 10-Q have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. Since inception, the Company has financed its operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of common stock. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $19,515,558.  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.  Future Financing  We need to raise additional operating capital on an immediate basis. There is no historical financial information about the Company on which to base an evaluation of our performance. We have generated minimal revenues from operations. Management cannot guarantee that it will be successful in its business operations. The business is subject to risks inherent in the medical device business enterprise in a highly competitive industry, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.  The Company believes it does not have enough cash on hand or will be able to generate enough income from operations to pay operating costs for the next twelve months. In order to carry out the business plan, including the expansion of the product line and manufacturing of the EOS medical devices, the Company will be required to seek equity or debt financing. If management is unable to raise sufficient funds to increase its manufacturing and deliver products, as well as enhance and develop new innovative devices, the Company will have to curtail its operations until such funds are received. There is no guarantee . . .  Nov 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

CARLSBAD, Calif., May 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc. commenced the launch of its flagship occlusion device product, the ArtVentive Endoluminal Occlusion System (EOS) at the Global Embolization Symposium and Technologies (GEST) in New York, NY on May 5-8.  The introduction in the United States follows the initial commercialization in the E.U. last year.Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160512/367025LOGODr. Jafar Golzarian, MD, GEST co-founder and Director of Interventional Radiology and Vascular Imaging at the University of Minnesota presented the ArtVentive EOS device to a standing room only audience of over 200 vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in a session titled the "New World of Micro Plugs."Dr. Marc Sapoval, GEST co-chairman and Professor of Clinical Radiology and Chair of the Cardiovascular Radiology Department Georges Pompidou Hospital, Paris, France deployed the device during the demonstration at the "Master class and Materials: Coils and Plugs".Dr. Adriaan Moelker, MD, PhD, Head Section Interventional Radiology at the Department of Radiology, Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the largest interventional radiology practice in the Netherlands, described his experience as an early adapter of EOS. His pioneering usage of the vascular occlusion device was demonstrated in multiple case studies conducted at his hospital and he reported his clinical experience and resultant benefits of using the ArtVentive EOS device in multiple arterial and venous applications.Dr. Moelker explained that he and his team "repeatedly used ArtVentive EOS at Erasmus University Medical Center in our practice of embolization procedures. The ArtVentive EOS device has a unique ability to act immediately, instantly occluding targeted vessels. EOS reduces procedure time substantially compared to conventional coil insertion, decreasing the amount of radiation received by both medical personnel and patient. EOS has great impact on our everyday practice, significantly reducing expenses and the negative effects of use of radiation during the procedure." Leon Rudakov, PhD, President and Chief Technology Officer of ArtVentive, commented, "This year, ArtVentive has established two Centers in the United States at George Washington University and TUFTS with interventional radiologists that are committed to assisting us in introducing our product to other professionals and hospitals. EOS is CE-marked and recently received FDA 510(k) approval in Q4 2015 and we are now strategically expanding our European and US operations through selecting distributors and proctoring centers." "GEST 2016 provided an ideal platform for us to launch our U.S. commercialization efforts with our exposure to the top professionals in the world and the opportunity to proctor over 50 physicians with hands-on training on the use of EOS.  ArtVentive demonstrated how EOS provides immediate and permanent occlusion, with key competitive advantages and clinical benefits over traditional methods and devices.  We are off to a great start in 2016 and look forward to continuing our product launch in the U.S. and expanding our EOS technology platform beyond peripheral vascular to other critical treatments in the rapidly growing field of interventional radiology, vascular surgery and beyond."About ArtVentiveMedical Group, Inc.ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc., with corporate headquarters in Carlsbad, California, is an innovative, multi-faceted medical device company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing globally a family of devices featuring the ArtVentive EOS.The ArtVentive EOS is a catheter­based, self­expandable device, which facilitates permanent and immediate occlusion of peripheral vessels.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ArtVentive Medical Group, Inc. (the "Company"), is a Nevada Corporation traded on the OTCQB (symbol AVTD). On January 9, 2010, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the assets of ArtVentive Medical Inc., a California company.  The Company remains focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing a family of Endoluminal Occlusion devices (EOS(TM)). The Company, through its proprietary technology has developed minimally invasive occlusion devices and procedures, allowing for the current interventional, image guided techniques to resolve potentially significant and unaddressed health issues. The ArtVentive EOS(TM) Peripheral device was developed by the Company to target the arterial and venous embolization peripheral vasculature markets. The  Company is currently expanding its EOS(TM) development to encompass several additional major clinical areas, including, but not limited to neurological vascular disorders, interventional oncology, women's health and interventional cardiology procedures.  The Company is expanding its product portfolio to include a proprietary Catheter-Assisted Endovascular Tumor Treatment (CAETT(TM)) system to deliver drugs and agents for minimally invasive, controlled and localized treatment of tumors as the Company enters the interventional oncology arena.  The Company is also continuing its ongoing expansion of the ArtVentive EOS(TM) peripheral device by developing a second generation of the device in enhancing the profile reductions from the current 6fr to a 4fr catheter, while expanding the opportunity to advance into new areas in treating a larger range of vessel sizes, expanding clinical applications and market opportunities. The Generation II EOS(TM) technology will add additional sizes to its current EOS(TM) portfolio of 5mm, 8mm and 11 mm to include an 18mm device with the ability of treating vessels in the range of 2-22mm, while achieving a lower profile for the device.  The Company has contracted, and expects to continue contracting with specific American and European corporations and consulting groups to assist in the implementation of an ongoing strategic plan for the successful international market development, commercialization and manufacturing of the Company's products. The Company entered into an agreement with Chicago, Illinois based Medical Murray Inc., a leader in the field of medical device development and manufacturing. Medical Murray Inc. is recognized as being ISO certified and FDA registered.  The Company entered into an agreement with the Northwest Clinical Research Group, Inc. (NCRG), located in Seattle, Washington. NCRG has played an intricate role in building the complex infrastructure and support necessary for outlining the regulatory and clinical strategy, in addition to providing a platform of quality controls parallel and synergistic to what Medical Murray is providing. Their responsibility also extends to encompass communication with the FDA and the European Notified Body (FDA counterpart).  The Company implemented its Quality Management System (QMS), based on the requirements of, and is intended to comply with, the following regulations and international standards:  ·  US FDA Quality System Regulation, 21 CFR 820  ·  EU Medical Device Directive (MDD), EEC 93/42  ·  Canada Medical Devices Regulations (CMDR), SOR/98-282  ·  ISO 13485:2003 Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems - Requirements Regulatory Purposes  A Document Control System and Design History File for the EOS project are in a continuous process of implementation. The secured system utilizes Egnyte software and is hosted on the NCRG's server.  The Company completed a comprehensive ISO Certification audit performed by BSI Product Services. BSI is an international ISO 9000/ISO Registrar and CE Mark Notified Body required for the European Regulatory approval and subsequent CE Mark certification. The audit confirmed that the Company's Document and Quality control systems were up to ISO standards and in compliance with international requirements for the maintaining quality of the products without non-conformities.  The Company received its CE Mark certification for the ArtVentive EOS(TM) Peripheral device on May 30, 2013, and implemented the planned EOS(TM) peripheral device transfer from Research and Development to commercialization, marketing, and distribution throughout Europe, simultaneous to making its FDA application.  The Company filed additional patent applications expanding its patent reach of the ArtVentive EOS(TM) device to 25 patents or patent applications.  The Company launched a Post Market Human Surveillance initiative throughout Europe, Australia and New Zealand. This clinical program is progressing well and designed to collect confirmatory data in support of the safety and performance of the ArtVentive Medical Group Endoluminal Occlusion System - EOS(TM). Additional post market studies will commence in the US following FDA approval and commercialization.  The Company currently has agreements encompassing twenty European countries.  On August 3, 2011, the Company incorporated the ArtVentive Women's Health Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Management reported that Mr. van der Laak join the Company in September 2014 as the Director of Sales for Europe. Mr. Harsa was added to the Company's sales organization as Regional Sales Director for the Eastern Region of the U.S. effective January 1, 2015.  The Company has developed a customized, comprehensive technology platform that will support management, distribution, sales and marketing globally by implementing a far-reaching Customer Relation Management (CRM) System.  This state of the art integrated Sales and Management Platform is comprised of three modules, each designed to be complimentary to the others, cloud-based and provides the highest level of controlled information and intelligence to advance the Company's information platform, marketing, sales and services to the interventional markets.  Management also reported that it had contracted with SalesForce.com, a global leader in CRM solutions and Financial Force, a leading provider of accounting, supply chain, human capital management and other solutions. This cloud-based platform eliminates the need for the Company to make a significant investment in hardware, software and personnel to manage customer information. The Company's management can access the customized applications via their laptop, iPad or iPhone.  Management showcased the ArtVentive EOS(TM) through its distribution partners when it attended the 17th European Vascular Conference in Maastricht, the Netherlands during March 2014, and the Charing Cross International Symposium (CX) in London during April 2014. The Company continued its directive to expand its reach as it prepares to launch into the US and global markets following regulatory approval by participating in the US Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) conference in San Diego, California in March 2014 and the CIRSE conference in Glasgow, Scotland during September 2014.  Results of Operations  During the year ended December 31, 2014, Management amended Research and Development expenditures in line with its final phase of development and regulatory submission of the ArtVentive EOS(TM) Peripheral device. The Company has continued its focus on the European launch of the EOS(TM) device and raising additional financing for the next phase of its planned business development, including reimbursement, sales, marketing, branding, distribution, clinical studies, commercialization and FDA submission and USA launch.  The following summary are the results of operations, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements contained herein.  Financial results for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:   Year ended December 31, 2014 2013 Operating revenues $ 111,732 $ NIL Cost of goods sold (111,732) NIL Operating expenses 6,273,666 3,497,077 Operating income (loss) (6,273,666) (3,497,077) Other income (expense) 699 786 Provision for income tax - - Net Income (Loss) $ (6,272,967) $ (3,496,291)  Revenue  Revenue commenced during first quarter 2014 and is derived solely from the sales of EOS devices.

Cost of goods sold increased by $111,732 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2014.  Expenses The Company's total operating expenses for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are outlined in the table below: For the three months For the twelve months ended December 31, ended December 31, 2014 2013 2014 2013 Research and development $ 356,885 $ 729,707 $ 3,127,850 $ 2,046,796 Salaries and wages 127,903 - 280,403 - Professional fees 141,239 248,629 498,581 755,428 General and administrative 687,038 266,469 2,363,668 693,393 Depreciation expense 850 (287) 3,164 1,460 Total $ 1,313,915 $ 1,244,518 $ 6,273,666 $ 3,497,077  Research and development costs increased by $1,081,054 for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2014 from the comparative period of 2013. Management expects research and development costs to be ongoing due to the enhancement of current products and the development of new devices. Management expects wages and salaries to increase substantially in the next twelve months as it expands its management, support staff and sales team. The increase was due to the initialization and transfer of the EOS device from research and ongoing development to commercialization. Management projects manufacturing costs to decrease over the next twelve months with the successful negotiation of a unit price cost from its manufacturing partner. The Company anticipates continued professional fees, mainly from regulatory, legal and accounting, due to ongoing SEC reporting requirements. General and administrative fees are for ongoing office expenses and other operating costs not directly related to the manufacturing costs. Such fees increased by $1,670,275 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 from the comparative period 2013.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  General  As of December 31, 2014, the Company had $104,030 in cash and cash equivalents.  North American markets, in addition to the continued development of its EOS devices and increased manufacturing projections.  Liquidity and Financial Condition Working Capital At At December 31, December 31, Increase/ 2014 2013 (Decrease) Current Assets $ 151,478 $ 1,662,522 $ (1,511,044) Current Liabilities $ 1,264,697 $ 858,309 $ (406,388) Working Capital/( Deficit) $ (1,113,219) $ 804,213 $ (1,917,432) Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (6,220,918) $ (3,237,676) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities $ (1,573) $ (11,634) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities $ 4,700,000 $ 4,358,000 Net Increase (decrease) in Cash During the Period $ (1,522,491) $ 1,108,690  The Company has no known demands or commitments and is not aware of any events or uncertainties as of December 31, 2014, that will result in or that are reasonably likely to materially increase or decrease our current liquidity.  Limited Operating History  There is no historical financial information about the Company on which to base an evaluation of our performance. The Company is a development stage corporation and has generated minimal revenues from operations. Management cannot guarantee that it will be successful in its business operations. The business is subject to risks inherent in the medical device business enterprise in a highly competitive industry, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns due to the price and cost increases in supplies and services.  The Company believes it does not have enough cash on hand or will be able to generate enough income from operations to pay operating costs for the next twelve months. In order to carry out the business plan, including the expansion of the product line, manufacturing of the EOS medical devices, the Company will be required to seek equity or debt financing. If management is unable to raise sufficient funds to increase its manufacturing and deliver products, as well as enhance and develop new innovative devices, the Company will have to curtail its operations until such funds are received. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in raising such funds.  Mar 31, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
