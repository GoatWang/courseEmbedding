REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon (Reuters)            Reuters  REUTERS Friday, July 21, 2017, 3:43 AM    By Julie  Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - Baidu Inc and JD.com will join other big Chinese technology firms, including Tencent Holdings, to jointly invest about $12 billion into state-owned mobile carrier China Unicom, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The move is part of efforts by China's government to rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital. Beijing added China Unicom last year to a first batch of state-owned enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform. Reuters reported last month that Alibaba Group Holdings and Tencent would be among new investors putting a total of about $10 billion into China United Network Communications Ltd, China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit. With the addition of money from Baidu, China's biggest internet search provider, and second-largest e-commerce company JD.com, the total investment into that unit is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan ($11.8 billion), the people said. Baidu would invest about 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion) and JD.com about 5 billion yuan, respectively, one of the people said. Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not public.  Baidu and JD.com declined to comment, and China Unicom, Alibaba and Tencent didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), which oversees state enterprises, also did not respond to requests for comment.

              By Julie  Zhu
              HONG KONG, July 21 (Reuters) - Baidu Inc and JD.com
will join other big Chinese technology firms to jointly
invest about $12 billion in the Shanghai-listed unit of China
Unicom, the weakest of three big state-owned telecoms firms, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
              The move is part of the Chinese government's drive to
rejuvenate state behemoths with private capital. Beijing added
China Unicom last year to a first batch of state-owned
enterprises to see mixed-ownership reform.
              China Unicom, formally known as China United Network
Communications Group Co Ltd, is one of the world's largest
mobile carriers by user numbers, but its recent earnings have
struggled in a fiercely competitive market.
              The carrier is widely seen as over-staffed, inefficient and
slow to develop key technologies. It already lags state-owned
China Mobile and China Telecom, and private
firms have moved ahead in developing cloud and big data
services, and mobile software.
              Reuters reported last month that Alibaba Group Holdings
and Tencent Holdings would be among new
investors putting a total of about $10 billion into China United
Network Communications Ltd, China Unicom's
Shanghai-listed unit.
              That total is likely to rise to about 80 billion yuan ($11.8
billion), with Baidu, China's biggest internet search provider,
investing about 10 billion yuan ($1.48 billion), and JD.com, the
country's second-largest e-commerce company, putting in about 5
billion yuan, one of the people said.
              The China Unicom unit is likely to raise 15 billion yuan
from Tencent and 7 billion yuan from Alibaba, while China Life
Investment Holding Co Ltd would be the biggest new investor,
with a 20 billion yuan commitment, that person added.
              Overall, it would be the largest capital raising in the
Asia-Pacific region since insurer AIA Group's 2010
initial public offering, according to Thomson Reuters data.
              The majority of the capital would be raised through new
share issues, while China Unicom would also sell part of its
stake in the Shanghai unit, the two people said.
              Both sources declined to be identified as the talks are not
public.
              Baidu and JD.com declined to comment, and China Unicom,
Alibaba and Tencent didn't respond to Reuters requests for
comment. China Life Investment Holding could not immediately be
reached for comment.
              China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration
Commission (SASAC), which oversees state enterprises, also did
not respond to requests for comment.
              
              5G PUSH
              After the share sale, China Unicom's stake in the
Shanghai-listed business would fall to just above 40 percent,
from 63 percent currently, one of the sources said, and top
investors, including China Life Investment and Tencent, would
likely have seats on the firm's board to engage in its
operations and improve its management.
              Both sources said teaming up with China's big tech
companies, particularly Tencent and Alibaba, would help revive
China Unicom by lowering the cost of attracting new users and
shifting its focus from traditional telecoms services to digital
information services.
              The share sale also comes at a time when Beijing is pushing
to build the world's largest fifth-generation (5G) mobile
network - bringing a significant speed upgrade from today's 4G
network.
              China's 5G market could be worth 1.1 trillion yuan, or 3.2
percent of GDP, by 2025, according to a recent research paper
from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
              The capital raising would give China Unicom the firepower to
boost its spending on 5G.
              Share trading in China Unicom's Shanghai-listed unit has
been halted since it said in early April it would be part of the
government's mixed-ownership pilot. It gave no further details
at that time. Prior to that suspension, the unit's market value
topped $23 billion.
              A week ago, the unit said it was waiting for regulatory
approvals over details of the mixed-ownership plans, and trading
in its shares would remain suspended for another month.
              The sources said the share sale plan is likely to be
finalized by late August.
