Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits
Prior to the Share Exchange, we were a "shell company" (as such term is defined
in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act")).  As a result of the Share Exchange, we have ceased to be a
shell company.  The information contained in this document constitutes the
current "Form 10 information" necessary to satisfy the conditions contained in
Rule 144(i)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act").


                                       4


Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement



The information contained in Item 2.01 below relating to the various agreements
described therein is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.01  Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets



                          THE SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT



The Registrant was incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003
under the name of Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation and
subsequently changed its name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. on May 18, 2015.
The Registrant commenced operations in the beauty supply industry as of January
1, 2004. On November 30, 2007, the Registrant's Board of Directors approved a
plan to dispose of its wholesale and retail beauty supply business. Since
January 1, 2009, the Registrant has had no operations and has been a shell
company.
 Further to our investigation of business opportunities, we have agreed to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of OXYS Corporation, a Nevada
corporation (OXYS).  The principal place of business of OXYS is 705 Cambridge
St., Cambridge, MA 02142.  Their contact number is (617) 500-5101. We have
entered into a securities exchange agreement with the shareholders of OXYS to
acquire 100% of the issued voting shares of OXYS in exchange for 34,687,244 of
the Registrant's common shares. The 34,687,244 common shares to be issued
consist wholly of securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933. The share consideration to be paid by the Registrant to the OXYS
shareholders will represent 90.2% of our issued voting equity on a fully diluted
basis following closing. Our acquisition of OXYS is an arm's length transaction.
No transactions, corporate events, negotiations, contacts, or conflicts of
interest occurred between the Registrant and OXYS outside of this agreement
during the past two years.  There are no legal proceedings related to the
agreement, and there are no further regulatory requirements connected to the
agreement.
OXYS is a development stage technology company that is engaged in the following
business areas:



1)


Providing engineering consulting services on a time and materials basis to
various companies engaged in advanced manufacturing technology as well as
implementing new technology in the Industrial Internet of Things - IIoT;
2)
Working with companies, OXYS provides custom engineered solutions for IIoT
implementations that involve the deployment of sensors, other hardware, and the
development of software that analyzes the data;
In support of these activities, there are several specific tasks that OXYS
executes on behalf of its clients:
1)
Development of Statements of Work for specific consulting services to be
provided;
2)
Execution of these technical consulting services on a time and materials
contract (i.e. actual billable hours plus material and other incidental costs
incurred);
3)
Development of technical specifications for products;
4)
Building prototypes of IIoT products for clients and as determined by OXYS
technical personnel to meet general industry needs;
5)
Working with outside manufacturers to product aforementioned products in larger
quantities as required



                                       5



The different sources of revenue that will result from these operations fall
into the following categories.  As of the date of this filing, OXYS does not
have reportable revenue for 2017.
1)
Consulting income based on time and materials contracts
2)
Product revenue resulting from sale of product
3)
Software licensing revenue resulting from recurring licenses of software
OXYS is in the process of quoting work for several clients.  This work consists
both of consulting revenues (Time and Material) as well as product revenues
(sales of products).   Non-disclosures prevent mentioning specific client names,
but they fall into the following categories:


1)

Large aerospace company

2)

Large overseas automotive manufacturer with extensive plants across North
America


3)

State Government



Part of the OXYS technology development and product development strategy is to
license technology from universities and research centers such as National Labs.
 At the present time, OXYS has negotiated a technology licensing option
agreement with MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for technology, means
and methods for the monitoring of current, voltage and power as it relates to
IIoT.  This agreement was executed on May 17, 2017.  Additionally OXYS will
generate revenue through partnerships with other companies.  At the present
time, OXYS has one joint technology development agreement - that was executed on
June 13 2017.  The client in Sigma Labs Inc. based in Santa Fe, NM.  Under this
agreement OXYS will provide time and materials consulting services to Sigma Labs
Inc. and will investigate the potential for future joint product development
opportunities.



Regulatory Approvals



There are no federal or state regulatory requirements that must be complied with
or from whom approval must be obtained in connection with the transaction.
Change of Control
 At the closing of the Securities Exchange Agreement, the OXYS Stockholders will
transfer all of their OXYS common shares to the Registrant in exchange for an
aggregate of 34,687,244 newly issued Registrant common shares. Also at closing
of the Securities Exchange Agreement, Carmine Catizone and Pasquale Catizone
will transfer to the Registrant an aggregate of 1,500,000 common shares for
cancellation such that neither of Messrs. Catizone shall retain 5% or more of
our voting securities. Pasquale Catizone has entered into a consulting agreement
with OXYS to provide consulting services during the transition.  Upon closing of
these transactions, the Registrant will have 38,453,319 common shares issued and
outstanding. The 34,687,244 common shares issued to the OXYS Stockholders at
closing will represent 90.2% of our voting securities.
 As a result of the transactions to be effected by the Securities Exchange
Agreement, (i) the new officers and directors will own 7,736,843 of our common
shares, representing 20.1% of our voting securities, (ii) the only other 5% or
more shareholder will own 3,000,000 of our common shares, representing 7.8% of
our voting securities (iii) Carmine Catizone and Daniel Generelli will each
resign as officers and directors, and (iv) Giro DiBiase will be appointed as
Chief Executive Officer and Director, Vidyadhar Mitta will be appointed as a
Director and Nevan C. Hanumara will be appointed as Secretary and a Director.
We continue to be a "smaller reporting company," as defined under the Exchange
Act, following the Share Exchange. We believe that as a result of the Share
Exchange we have ceased to be a "shell company" (as such term is defined in Rule
12b-2 under the Exchange Act).

Government Regulations



There is no need for any government approval for any of our products, and there
are no currently existing or probable governmental regulations that will
negatively affect OXYS' business plan.



                                       7



Markets


OXYS has entered into discussion with several potential early adopter customers
in the machine tool industry and general industrial product markets.  OXYS would
provide industrial monitoring tools and would install devices that allow older
industrial machines to connect with the IIOT.
OXYS intends to sell to a large variety of customers, and is not dependent upon
any single customer, nor is the work seasonal.
Competition
Due to the nature of OXYS' business strategy, it is competing with many other
companies involved in the IIOT, such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Oracle, and SAP,
as well as middleware software manufacturers such as MachineShop and Waygum.
 These companies all work with software, hardware, and cloud storage.  OXYS
intends to compete with these companies by providing local data storage for
industrial IIOT applications and network security.
Employees
As of June 16, 2017, there are no full or part time employees of OXYS.  All work
is done through independent contractors.



                           DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTIES



Our offices are located at 705 Cambridge St., Cambridge, MA 02142.  The offices
occupy approximately 1,000 sq ft, and have been provided for OXYS' use rent free
by Giro DiBiase.  Starting July, 2017, OXYS will start paying $1,500 a month for
rent.  There is no lease agreement, and we are currently operating the offices
on a month to month basis.



                                  RISK FACTORS



Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.



   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
                                   OPERATIONS


Forward-Looking Statements


Statements in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations contain certain forward looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be
covered by the safe harbors created thereby.  To the extent that such statements
are not recitations of historical fact, such statements constitute forward
looking statements which, by definition involve risks and uncertainties. Where
in any forward looking statements, OXYS expresses an expectation or belief as to
future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith
and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the
statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished.
The following are factors that could cause actual results or events to differ
materially from those anticipated, and include but are not limited to: general
economic, financial and business conditions; changes in and compliance with
governmental regulations; changes in tax laws; and the cost and effects of legal
proceedings.





                                       8



You should not rely on forward looking statements in this document.  This
management's discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks
and uncertainties.  We use words such as "anticipates," "believes," "plans,"
"expects," "future," "intends," and similar expressions to identify these
forward-looking statements.  Prospective investors should not place undue
reliance on these forward looking statements, which apply only as of the date of
this document.  Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
Critical Accounting Policies
The following discussions are based upon our audited financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. These financial statements and accompanying notes have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies.
OXYS continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare
the financial statements. OXYS bases its estimates on historical experiences and
assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances.
Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.
Trends and Uncertainties
There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time. There
are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected
to have a material impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes
for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of
OXYS' financial statements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
At March 31, 2017, OXYS had cash and cash equivalents of $573,759.  Its working
capital balance at March 31, 2017 was $646,195.  Management believes that OXYS
will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it
can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever.  Management plans to
seek additional debt and/or equity financing for OXYS, but cannot assure that
such financing will be available on acceptable terms.
OXYS did not pursue any investing activities for the period from inception
(August 4, 2016) to March 31, 2017.
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, OXYS had an increase in deferred
security exchange agreement expenses of $7,108, and received $141,500 from the
issuance of common stock.  As a result, OXYS had net cash provided by financing
activities of $134,392 for the period.
OXYS is a development stage company and has not yet begun generating revenues.
Management believes we will be able to pursue our business plan once the stock
exchange has been completed.
Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016
OXYS did not generate any revenues. We paid bank service charges of $82, office
supply costs of $100, and organization costs of $1,000. We paid professional
fees of $7,162 and travel expenses of $282. As a result, we recorded a net loss
of $8,626 for the period from inception (August 4, 2016) to December 31, 2016.




                                       9


Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017
OXYS did not generate any revenues.  We paid bank service charges of $80, office
expenses of $828, and organization costs of $2,275.  We paid professional fees
of $26,820 and travel expenses of $1,729.  As a result, we recorded a net loss
of $31,732 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Plan of Operation
OXYS is in the development stage and has not conducted any material operations
to date or received any significant operating revenues.  OXYS may experience
problems, delays, expenses and difficulties sometimes encountered by an
enterprise in OXYS' stage of development, many of which are beyond OXYS'
control.  These include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating
to the employee costs, marketing problems, additional costs and expenses that
may exceed current estimates and competition.
OXYS needs to achieve the following milestones during the next twelve months.

available, such financing will be on acceptable terms to enable OXYS to complete
its business plan.

Directors are elected to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and
until their successors are elected and qualified.  Directors are elected by a
plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting of stockholders and hold
office until the expiration of the term for which he or she was elected and
until a successor has been elected and qualified.
A majority of the authorized number of directors constitutes a quorum of the
Board of Directors for the transaction of business. The directors must be
present at the meeting to constitute a quorum. However, any action required or
permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors may be taken without a meeting
if all members of the Board of Directors individually or collectively consent in
writing to the action.

Director Independence



We are not currently subject to listing requirements of any national securities
exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority
of the board of directors be "independent" and, as a result, we are not at this

"independent directors."

	1.




	THE COMPANY






	Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the Company) was incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003.  It was formed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of Creative Beauty Supply, Inc., (CBS) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company, a publicly traded New Jersey corporation.  On January 1, 2004, the assets and liabilities of CBS were contributed at book value to the Company, and this subsidiary was then spun-off by CBS to its stockholders.  





	The Companys current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company.  In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather than merge.





	No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company.  The Company provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be qualified for trading in the United States secondary market.





	The Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend their Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares to 200,000,000 (See note 3), to amend Articles of Incorporation to change the Companys name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc., and to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares. The corporations actions became effective as of May 18, 2015.





	On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Gotham Capital, Inc. and certain Gotham Capital, Inc. shareholders which would have resulted in a change of control of the Company upon execution of the agreement. On July 22, 2016, both parties signed a mutual release which agrees to settle disputes and differences that have arisen between the two parties and cancelled the SPA. The Company has received a reimbursement of $20,000 for professional fees related to the agreement which has been recorded as miscellaneous income in the statement of operations  (See note 4).

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Interim Financial Statement Presentation



	The December 31, 2015 balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, its results of operations for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.





	The statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.





	While the Company believes that the disclosures presented are adequate to make the information not misleading, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Companys annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.






	Loss Per Share



	The Company computes loss per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock options and warrants.  There were no dilutive common stock equivalents for all periods presented.






	Going Concern



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.





	As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred continuing operating losses and has an accumulated deficit of $774,149 at September 30, 2016. The Company has no revenue generating operations and has limited cash resources. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.









	8









	Management believes that it will be able to achieve a satisfactory level of liquidity to meet the Companys obligations through September 30, 2017 by obtaining additional financing from key officers, directors and certain investors. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.






	Recently Issued Accounting Standards



	Management does not believe that any recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.






	3.




	STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY






	Effective May 18, 2015, the Company increased the authorized shares to 200,000,000, 190,000,000 shares shall be designated common stock and have a par value of $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares shall be designated preferred stock and have a par value of $.001 per share. The Company also recorded a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares.





	Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata in all assets  remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Companys common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.






	4.




	MISCELLANEOUS INCOME






	On August 22, 2016 the Company received $20,000 as a reimbursement for professional fees paid in 2015.  The reimbursement has been classified as miscellaneous income in the Statement of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 (See note 1).

	Item 2.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations






	Forward-Looking Statements



	This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following:  Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates.  These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.  





	Gotham Capital Holding, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the Company) undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.






	Critical Accounting Policies



	The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amounts based on managements best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors they believe are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.






	Trends and Uncertainties



	There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time.  There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of the Companys financial statements.









	11










	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	At September 30, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $40,317, which represents a $11,462 increase from the $28,855 balance at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily the result of a cash expense reimbursement received net of cash used to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.  The Companys working capital balance at September 30, 2016 was $12,492, as compared to a December 31, 2015 balance of $8,621.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had net income of $3,871. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: we had an increase of $14,166 due to accounts payable and a decrease of $6,575 due to accrued expenses. As a result, we had a net cash provided by in operating activities of $11,462 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $23,340. We had the following adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities: we had a decrease of $10,813 due to accounts payable and a decrease of $9,075 due to accrued expenses. As a result, we had a net cash used in operating activities of $43,228 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.





	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no investing or financing activities.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred losses of from operations of $16,146 and $23,405 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has an accumulated deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	Management believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on accepted terms.





	The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a going concern qualification in their auditors report dated April 1, 2016. Such a going concern qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.









	12









	The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve the Companys operating results.






	Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015.






	For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $14,730 and miscellaneous expenses of $1,416. We earned interest income of $17 and received a $20,000 expense reimbursement for professional fees. As a result we had $3,871 income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.





	Comparatively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $22,323 and miscellaneous expenses of $1,082. We earned interest income of $65. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $23,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.





	The Company had $3,871 in net income in the current period versus a net loss of $23,340 in the prior year. Operating expenses were incurred primarily to enable the Company to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.





	During the current and prior period, the Company did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Companys ability to utilize the deferred tax assets.






	Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015.






	For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $4,654 and miscellaneous expense of $168. We earned interest income of $5 and received a $20,000 expense reimbursement for professional fees. As a result we had income of $15,183 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.





	Comparatively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, we did not earn any revenues. We incurred professional fees of $12,358 and miscellaneous expenses of $-0-. We earned interest income of $16. As a result, we incurred a net loss of $12,342 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.








	Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk





	Not applicable for a smaller reporting company.

	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.






	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.  Based on the existence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting discussed in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide such reasonable assurances.





	We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud.  Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any.  The design of disclosure controls and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.






	Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses






	At such time that it is economically feasible, we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we can maintain adequate segregation of duties and be able to ensure that all necessary disclosures are reported in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Although we believe that this corrective step will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is hired and trained, we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient.  We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess, and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control.









	14










	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS  Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the Company) was incorporated in the state of New Jersey on October 1, 2003. It was formed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of Creative Beauty Supply, Inc., as a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company, a publicly traded New Jersey corporation.   Corporate Operations On January 1, 2004, the Company commenced operations in the beauty supply industry at both the wholesale and retail levels. On November 30, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan to dispose of its wholesale and retail beauty supply business.  As of January 1, 2009, the Company has had no operations and is a shell company.   The Companys business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company.  In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or may wish to contribute or sell assets to the Company rather than to merge.  No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company.  The Company seeks to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting or public company whose securities are qualified for trading in the United States secondary markets.  A business combination with a target company normally will involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, or, if the Company does enter into such a business combination, no assurances can be given as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.  The current and proposed business activities described herein classify the Company as a blank check company.  The Securities and Exchange Commission and many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies.  Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in the Companys securities until such time as the Company has successfully implemented its business plan described herein.  In 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend their Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares to 200,000,000, to amend Articles of Incorporation to change the Companys name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc., and to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares. The corporation actions became effective as of May 18, 2015.   4    On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Gotham Capital, Inc. and certain Gotham Capital, Inc. shareholders which will result in a change of control of the Company upon execution of the agreement. After the change of control, the Company will pursue new lines of business.  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS  Not applicable to a smaller reporting company.   ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS  Not applicable.   ITEM 2. PROPERTIES  The Company has no properties and at this time, has no arrangements to acquire any properties.  The Company currently uses for its principal place of business the home office of Pasquale Catizone, a principal shareholder of the Company, at no cost.  Management expects this arrangement to continue until the Company completes an acquisition or merger.   ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  There is no litigation pending or threatened by or against the Company.   ITEM 4.   MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES  Not applicable   5   PART II  ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES  (a)  Market Information.  The Company began trading publicly on the NASD Over the Counter Bulletin Board on May 12, 2006.  We now trade under the symbol GTHM.  The following table sets forth the range of high and low bid quotations for our common stock.  The quotations represent inter-dealer prices without retail markup, markdown or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.           Quarter Ended     High Bid     Low Bid   3/31/14     0.2     0.2   6/30/14     0.2     0.2   9/30/14     0.2     0.2   12/31/14     0.2     0.2                   3/31/15     0.2     0.2   6/30/15     2.0     0.2   9/30/15     1.5     0.8   12/31/15     1.5     1.5   Holders.  There were approximately 90 record holders of the Companys common stock as of April 1, 2016.  The issued and outstanding shares of the Companys common stock were issued in accordance with the exemptions from registration afforded by Sections 3(b) and 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  Dividends.  Holders of the registrant's common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by its board of directors.  No dividends on the registrants common stock have ever been paid, and the registrant does not anticipate that dividends will be paid on its common stock in the foreseeable future.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  Not applicable to a smaller reporting company.   ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Forward-Looking Statements Statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, as well as in certain other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the Company) that look forward in time, are forward- looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, expectations, predictions, and assumptions and other statements which are other than statements of historical facts. Although the Company believes such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that any forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to, and are qualified by, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. These risk, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to the Companys ability to estimate the impact of competition and of industry consolidation and risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth in the Companys filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-K.  Critical Accounting Policies The following discussions as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this Form 10-K are based upon our audited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.   7   The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.  Trends and Uncertainties There are no material commitments for capital expenditure at this time.  There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of the Companys financial statements.  Liquidity and Capital Resources At December 31, 2015, the Company had a cash balance of $28,855, which represents a $59,224 decrease from the $88,079 balance at December 31, 2014. This decrease was primarily the result of cash used to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company and the cost associated with increasing its authorized shares and effectuating a reverse stock split. The Companys working capital balance at December 31, 2015 was $8,621, as compared to a December 31, 2014 balance of $60,213.  The registrant did not pursue any investing or financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The Company is undergoing a merger with Gotham Capital, Inc. Under this plan of merger, the Company will be acquiring Gotham Capital, Inc. in a reverse acquisition transaction and will be the surviving entity, and the shareholders of Gotham Capital, Inc. will own a controlling interest in the surviving entity. The Company changed its name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. The Company also underwent a 1-for-2 reverse split of its common shares. Management has considered these actions to be in the best interest of the shareholders, and will improve the marketability of the Companys common stock. These corporate actions noted above became effective as of May 18, 2015.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, The Company has incurred losses of $51,592 and $29,752 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and has an accumulated deficit, which raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.  Management believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms.  8    The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required.  Our auditors have included a going concern qualification in their auditors report dated April 1, 2016. Such a going concern qualification may make it more difficult for us to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve the Companys operating results.  Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014.  The Company had a net loss of $51,592 in 2015 versus net loss of $29,752 in 2014. The $21,840 difference between the year ended 2015 and the year ended 2014 is a result of an increase in professional fees of $21,427, an increase in other general expenses of $339 and a decrease in interest income of $74. Operating expenses were incurred primarily to enable the Company to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company, increasing its authorized shares, effectuating a reverse stock split, and potential merger. For the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 professional fees were $50,538 and $29,111, respectively.  During the current and prior year the Company did not record an income tax benefit due to the uncertainty associated with the Companys ability to merge with an operating company, which might permit the Company to avail itself of those advantages and the Companys ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited by a potential merger.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.

(F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation)  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation)  (the Company) as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows for the years then ended. The financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company's recurring losses from operations, accumulated deficit and working capital deficiency, and lack of revenue generating operations, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 2. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  /s/ ROTENBERG MERIL SOLOMON BERTIGER & GUTTILLA, P.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014  1. THE COMPANY  Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc. (F/K/A Creative Beauty Supply of New Jersey Corporation) (the Company) was incorporated in the State of New Jersey on October 1, 2003.  It was formed pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of Creative Beauty Supply, Inc., as a wholly-owned subsidiary of that company, a publicly traded New Jersey corporation.    The Companys current business plan is to attempt to identify and negotiate with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company.  In certain instances, a target company may wish to become a subsidiary of the Company or wish to contribute assets to the Company rather than merge.  No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in identifying or negotiating with any target company.  The Company provides a means for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting (public) company whose securities would be qualified for trading in the United States secondary market.  The Board of Directors of the Company adopted resolutions to amend their Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized shares to 200,000,000 (See note 5), to amend Articles of Incorporation to change the Companys name to Gotham Capital Holdings, Inc., and to authorize a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares.  The corporation actions became effective as of May 18, 2015  On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Gotham Capital, Inc. and certain Gotham Capital, Inc. shareholders which will result in a change of control of the Company upon execution of the agreement. After the change of control, the Company will pursue new lines of business.  2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  Financial Statement Presentation The Companys financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.   17   Use of Estimates The preparation of these financial statements require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. The Company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the financial statements. The Company bases its estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.  Cash Equivalents Short-term investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less and highly liquid investments are considered cash and cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents consist of a money market account.  Income Taxes The Company utilizes Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC 740), Income Tax (ASC 740). ASC 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been include in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacting tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  The Company has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10-05, Accounting for Uncertainties in Income Taxes. The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.  Loss Per Share The Company computes loss per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding, which includes convertible debentures, stock options and warrants. There were no dilutive common stock equivalents for all periods presented.   18   Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Companys recurring losses from operations and lack of revenue generating operations and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.  Management believes the Company will continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations until it can achieve profitability and positive cash flows, if ever. Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations, and obtain additional financing as may be required. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.  The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its business plan or that the successful implementation of such business plan will actually improve the Companys operating results.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.  3. CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  The Company maintains its cash balance with a major bank. The balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 per depositor. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 all cash balances were fully insured.   19    4. INCOME TAXES  The deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:            2015  2014   Net operating loss carry forwards  $213,900  $196,500   Less: Valuation allowance  (213,900)  (196,500)   Total  $               -  $                -  A 100% valuation allowance was provided at December 31, 2015 and 2014 as it is uncertain if the deferred tax assets would be utilized and the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to potential change of control.  The increase in the valuation allowance was a result from the current year net operating loss.  At December 31, 2015, the Company has unused federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $601,900 expiring between 2024 and 2035 and unused New Jersey net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $187,500 expiring between  2029 and 2035.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits, and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required. The Company does not expect that its unrecognized tax benefits will materially increase within the next twelve months. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2015 and 2014.  The Company files its federal and New Jersey income tax returns under varying statutes of limitations. The 2012 through 2015 tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and New Jersey tax authorities.  5.  STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY  Effective May 18, 2015, the Company increased the authorized shares to 200,000,000. 190,000,000 shares shall be designated common stock and have a par value of $0.001 per share and 10,000,000 shares shall be designed preferred stock and have a par value of $0.001 per share. The Company also recorded a 1-for-2 reverse split of all outstanding common shares.  Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to share ratable in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors in its discretion from funds legally available therefore. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of   20   the Company, the holders of common stock are entitled to share pro rata in all assets remaining after payment in full of all liabilities. All of the outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and non-assessable. Holders of common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the Companys common stock. There are no conversion or redemption rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.  6.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of this filing.   21   ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES None.   ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2015.  We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control.  Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible.  However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.  Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures to be not effective as of December 31, 2015 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Our internal control over financial reporting is the process designed by and under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or the persons performing similar functions, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These officers have evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Guidance for Smaller Public Companies.  Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and concluded that it was not effective because of the material weakness described below:   22   Due to resource constraints, material weaknesses continue to be evident to management regarding our inability to generate all the necessary disclosure for inclusion in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission due to the lack of resources and segregation of duties.  A material weakness is a significant deficiency in one or more of the internal control components that alone or in the aggregate precludes our internal controls from reducing to an appropriately low level the risk that material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  This annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Managements report was not subject to attestation by the registrants registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the registrant to provide only managements report in this annual report.  Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have evaluated changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.  Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or those persons performing similar functions, did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses  At such time that it is economically feasible, we will aggressively recruit experienced professionals to ensure that we maintain adequate segregation of duties and have controls in place to ensure proper disclosures are in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although we believe that these corrective steps will enable management to conclude that the internal controls over our financial reporting are effective when the staff is trained, we cannot assure you these steps will be sufficient. We may be required to expend additional resources to identify, assess and correct any additional weaknesses in internal control.  Important Considerations  The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.

OTHER INFORMATION None.  23    PART III  ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, PROMOTERS, CONTROL PERSONS AND CORPORATE GOVERANCE  (a) Identity of Officers and Directors  Set forth below are the names of the directors and officers of the Company, all positions and offices with the Company held, the period during which he has served as such, and his business experience during at least the last five (5) years:             Name     Age     Position and Offices Held     Director Since   Carmine Catizone     71     President, Director     October 1, 2003 to present                         Daniel Generelli     53     Secretary, Treasurer, Vice-President, Director     October 1, 2003 to present   Carmine Catizone.  Mr. Catizone has been President and a director of the Company since its incorporation on October 1, 2003.  From June 1988 to July 1994, Mr. Catizone was president and a director of J&E Beauty Supply, Inc., a retail and wholesale beauty supply distributor. Mr. Catizone served as president and a director of C&C Investments, Inc., a blank check company (now known as T.O.P.S.

Medical Corp.  From June 1980 to December 1985, Mr. Catizone had been district sales manager (engaged in sales of cosmetics) for Chattem Labs. Mr. Catizone received his Bachelor of Science degree from Fairleigh Dickerson University in 1972.  Daniel Generelli. Mr. Generelli has been secretary-treasurer and a director of the Company since its incorporation on October 1, 2003. From December 1989 to July 1995, Mr. Generelli was secretary/treasurer and a director of J&E Beauty Supply, Inc., a retail and wholesale beauty supply distributor.  From December 1984 to December 1989, Mr. Generelli was employed as a distribution supervisor with Tags Beauty Supply, a retail and wholesale beauty supply distributor in Fairfield, NJ. Mr. Generelli graduated from Ramapo College of New Jersey with a Bachelor of Science degree in June of 1984.  Other than Mr. Catizone and Mr. Generelli, the Company did not have any significant employees as of the date of this Report.  There were no family relationships between any of the officers or directors of the Company.  During the fiscal year covered by this Report, there were no changes to the procedures by which security holders could recommend nominees to the Companys board of directors.   24   At this time, the Company does not have an audit committee because the Company has not engaged in any business operations for at least the last two years.  The Companys board of directors acts as its audit committee. Similarly, the Companys board of directors has determined that it does not have an audit committee financial expert as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission rules.  Current Blank Check Companies  Daniel Generelli, an officer and director of the Company, is an officer and director of Baynon International Corp., a blank check company.  Carmine Catizone, the president and director of the Company, is a shareholder of Baynon International Corp., a blank check company.  Other than disclosed above, no directors or officers of the Company are presently officers, directors or shareholders in any blank check companies except for the Company.  However, one or both of the officers/directors may, in the future, become involved with additional blank check companies.  (b) Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the Companys officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten (10%) percent of a class of equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the principal exchange upon which such securities are traded or quoted. Reporting Persons are also required to furnish copies of such reports filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with the Company.  Based solely on review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company, the Companys two (2) directors did not file their reports on a timely basis.  Code of Ethics  The Company has not yet adopted a code of ethics.  The board of directors anticipates that it will adopt a code of ethics upon identifying and negotiating with a business target for the merger of that entity with and into the Company, although there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to enter into such a transaction.  Corporate Governance  We have no change in any state law or other procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our board of directors. In addition to having no nominating committee for this purpose, we currently have no specific audit committee and no audit committee financial expert. Based on the fact that our current business affairs are simple, any such committees are excessive and beyond the scope of our business and needs.   25   ITEM 11.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  The following table sets forth, as of April 1, 2016, certain information regarding the ownership of the common stock by (i) each person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than five (5%) percent of Common Stock, (ii) each of the Companys Directors and Named Executive Officers, as such term is defined under Item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act, and (iii) all of the Companys Executive Officers and Directors as a group.  Beneficial ownership has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under Rule 13d-3 certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (such as where persons share voting power or investment power).  In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon the exercise of an option) within sixty (60) days of the date as of which the information is provided.  In computing the ownership percentage of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights.  As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the person's actual ownership or voting power at any particular date.  This table has been prepared based on 5,266,075 shares outstanding as of April 1, 2016.

ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  None.  Director Independence  The Companys board of directors consists of Carmine Catizone and Daniel Generelli. Neither of them is independent as such term is defined by a national securities exchange or an inter-dealer quotation system.    ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES  Audit Fees  The aggregate fees billed and estimated to be billed for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 for professional services rendered by Rotenberg, Meril, Solomon, Bertiger & Guttilla, P.C. (RMSB&G) for the audit of the registrant's annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included in the registrant's Form 10-Q or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $13,400 and $13,400 respectively.  Audit related fees  We did not incur any aggregate audit related fees from RMSB&G for the 2015 and 2014 fiscal years for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the registrants financial statements.  Tax Fees  We did not incur any aggregate tax fees and expenses from RMSB&G for the 2015 and 2014 fiscal years for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.   28   All Other Fees  We did not incur any other fees from RMSB&G for the 2015 and 2014 fiscal years.  The board of directors, acting as the Audit Committee considered whether, and determined that, the auditor's provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence. All of the services described above for fiscal year 2015 were approved by the board of directors pursuant to its policies and procedures. We intend to continue using RMSB&G solely for audit and audit-related services and, as needed, for due diligence in acquisitions.   29   Part IV  ITEM 15.
