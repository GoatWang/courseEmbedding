5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

Jeff

Today is September 1, my payments are due on the 1st. Why is it that when I pull up my unit it to pay my bill it shows past due. That is causes me to get angry, it is a stupid policy and it is totally unprofessional to say I am past due when I pay on the due date! There is nothing that says I am required to pay before my due date nor is it a smart marketing plan. Why would I pay before my due date? Offer me $10 off for paying early and I will consider it, but I am NOT past due if I pay at 8am on the 1st day of the month, when the payment and contract say I am due to make a payment. If it is due on the first, I will pay on the 1st and therefore it is paid on time, correct? It seems like a simple programing item to show people past due on the 2nd of the month, doesn't it? Finally, my unit is supposed to be 10x10 and it is 10x8.5!

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

Jeff

Today is September 1, my payments are due on the 1st. Why is it that when I pull up my unit it to pay my bill it shows past due. That is causes me to get angry, it is a stupid policy and it is totally unprofessional to say I am past due when I pay on the due date! There is nothing that says I am required to pay before my due date nor is it a smart marketing plan. Why would I pay before my due date? Offer me $10 off for paying early and I will consider it, but I am NOT past due if I pay at 8am on the 1st day of the month, when the payment and contract say I am due to make a payment. If it is due on the first, I will pay on the 1st and therefore it is paid on time, correct? It seems like a simple programing item to show people past due on the 2nd of the month, doesn't it? Finally, my unit is supposed to be 10x10 and it is 10x8.5!

Renting a storage unit

More about self storage basics




What is a roll-up door?

							Roll-up doors are the most common door in self-storage. They are accessed by sliding a latch and lifting the door upward, similar to the motion of a garage door. Roll-up doors allow you to maximize the usage of your space.
						


Difference between indoor and outdoor unit?

							An outdoor unit is most often a drive-up unit, located on the first floor of a facility, that gives you the ability to load your belongings directly from a vehicle or truck. An inside unit is within the property and will require you to go inside to access your unit which may be on the first floor or may require you to use an elevator to go to another floor of the facility.

Storage Lease







How far in advance can I book a reservation?

							We give you the flexibility to book a reservation up to 14 days in advance to help you plan ahead.
						


How long of a lease am I required to sign?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis which allows customers flexibility to rent for whatever time period is needed. Customers with long term needs may prepay on a yearly basis (12 months) and get a 13th month free.
						


What documentation is needed to rent?

							You will need to bring a government issued ID to complete your storage unit rental. The easiest and most convenient method to pay your monthly storage unit fee is through easy pay. You will need a credit card to take advantage of this service.
						


What are my payment options/terms?

							Extra Space Storage strives to make your storage experience as convenient as possible, including paying your bill. Monthly payment can be made in-store, online, by phone (888-STORAGE), or by mailing us a check. In-store payments can be made with cash, check or credit card. We can help you set up automatically withdrawn payments each month from your credit card or checking account. Payments can be made online in the "My Account" section here at extraspace.com.
						


Do you offer the convenience of long-term lease?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis which allows customers flexibility to rent for whatever time period is needed. Customers with long-term needs may prepay on a yearly basis (12 months) and get a 13th month free.
						


What are the lease terms?

							Our units are rented on a month-to-month basis. Your rental with us can be long or short – depending on your needs. Monthly rent is due each month on the anniversary of your rental start date. For your convenience we offer many payment options including the option to pre-pay for up to twelve months of rent. When you are ready to vacate we require two days verbal OR 15 days written notice before vacating. If you advise the rental office of your intention to vacate before paying your final month, we will prorate your last month of rent so you pay only for what you use.
						


Is my price guaranteed for as long as I rent?

							Extra Space Storage works hard to provide a value to our customers through competitive pricing and by maintaining clean, safe, and secure facilities with the best customer service in the self-storage industry. Please keep in mind that your original monthly rate is not guaranteed for the life of your rental with Extra Space Storage. From time to time, we find it necessary to make adjustments to our customers’ rental rates in order to keep up with the rising costs associated with providing top-notch service and a clean, secure facility.
						


What do I need to have on move-in day?

							If you’ve decided to insure your items outside of the insurance policies offered by Extra Space Storage, you will need to have a copy of your insurance policy, declaration or the like when you move-in. You are also required to provide your own lock for your storage unit. If you forget to bring a lock or need items such as boxes, packing tape, or move-in kits on move-in day, all of those and more are available for purchase at each of our storage facilities.
						


Can I change to a different size after I've already moved in?

							If the unit size you want is available at your facility, then yes you can move into another unit. Your local facility manager will be able to assist you in that transition.
						


What if I'm late making a payment?

							Your monthly rent is due on the same day each month (the anniversary date of the rental). Extra Space Storage provides a five day grace period before charging a late fee on the 6th day past a payment due date. The late fee assessed varies by state according to local self-storage law; the grace period for a past-due payment can also vary by state. For further details, please refer to your lease or contact your storage facility. Late fees cannot be waived and the full balance must be paid immediately to avoid foreclosure. No partial payments are accepted. Please also note that until your account is paid in full, access to your unit may be denied, your gate code access is removed and your unit will be over-locked. The late fees assessed vary according to state laws.
						


How long after my account is deliquent will stuff go to auction?

							The length of time for a past-due account to be placed in auction varies by state law. We recommend that you contact the Store Manager to discuss your account as soon as possible if your payment is late. Extra Space Storage will provide written notice to your email address or physical address listed on your account, again depending on state law. Additionally, Store Managers frequently try to contact any customer in default by phone prior to an auction process. As a customer, it is your responsibility to make sure we have accurate, up-to-date contact information associated with your account, and to pay your bill on time.
						


What happens if my belongings go to auction?

							Once the unit is sold the proceeds are applied to your outstanding balance. If the proceeds are higher than the amount due, a check for the difference will be sent to the original person leasing the storage unit. If the proceeds are lower than the outstanding balance the account will be sent to collections.

Difference between office and access and gate hours?

							The office hours are the hours of operation for the property. During these hours the Store Manager will be available to assist you with your storage needs or moving and packing supplies. The gate hours are the hours of the property, and when your unit can be accessed. If you require access outside of our standard gate hours ask your Store Manager for information about 24-hour access.

Extra Space Storage LP Key Developments

Extra Space Storage Inc. and Extra Space Storage LP Enters into a Note Purchase Agreement
Jun 30 17
On June 29, 2017, Extra Space Storage Inc. and Extra Space Storage LP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with the various purchasers
named therein. The Note Purchase Agreement provides for the private placement by the Operating Partnership of $300 million of 3.95% Senior Notes, due August 24, 2027 (the Notes"). The Notes are expected to be issued on August 24, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, at which time the Purchasers will disburse the funds to the Operating Partnership. Upon issuance, the Notes will pay interest semiannually on the 1st day of March and September in each year until their maturity. The Operating Partnership may prepay at any time all, or from time to time any part of, the Notes, in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100% of the principal amount so prepaid plus a Make-Whole Amount. The Note Purchase Agreement contains a number of customary financial covenants, including, without limitation, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum secured debt ratio and maximum unencumbered leverage ratio. The financial covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement are substantially similar to the financial covenants in the Operating Partnership's existing Credit Agreement, dated October 16, 2016, by and among the Operating Partnership, the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as administrative agent, certain other financial institutions acting as syndication agents, documentation agents, senior management agents and lead arrangers and book runners, and certain lenders party thereto. Subject to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement and the Notes, upon certain events of default, including, but not limited to, (i) a default in the payment of any principal, Make-Whole Amount or interest under the Notes, (ii) a default in the performance of covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement, the Notes and the related guaranty, (iii) a default in the payment of certain other indebtedness of the Operating Partnership, the Company or their subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, and (iv) bankruptcy events related to the Operating Partnership, the Company and their subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Credit Agreement, the principal and accrued and unpaid interest and the Make-Whole Amount on the outstanding Notes will become due and payable at the option of the Purchasers.


Extra Space Storage LP Announces Pricing of Private Offering of $500 Million of 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes Due 2035
Sep 15 15
Extra Space Storage Inc. announced that its operating partnership subsidiary, Extra Space Storage LP, priced a private placement of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.125% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2035 (the "Notes"). Up to an additional $75.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes may be issued upon exercise by the initial purchasers, within thirty (30) days of the date of pricing of the Notes, of their over-allotment option to purchase additional Notes. The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. The Operating Partnership intends to use the net proceeds from the private offering to fund potential acquisitions, including its previously announced acquisition of SmartStop Self Storage Inc., to retire outstanding indebtedness and for other general corporate and working capital purposes. Concurrently with the offering, the Operating Partnership has agreed to repurchase approximately $164.6 million of the Operating Partnership's outstanding 2.375% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2033 for approximately $228.1 million. During certain periods and subject to certain conditions, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holder into cash and, at the Operating Partnership's option, shares of common stock of the Company at an initial exchange rate of 10.4827 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The initial exchange price of approximately $95.40 represents an approximate 27.5% premium over the last reported sale price per share of the Company's common stock on September 15, 2015, which was $74.82 per share. The initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The Notes will mature on October 1, 2035, unless earlier exchanged, redeemed or repurchased. Prior to October 5, 2020, the Operating Partnership may not redeem the Notes except to preserve the Company's status as a real estate investment trust. On or after October 5, 2020, subject to certain conditions, the Operating Partnership may redeem all or a portion of the Notes for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus unpaid interest, if any, accrued to, but excluding, the redemption date. Unless the Operating Partnership has called the Notes for redemption, the holders of the Notes may require the Operating Partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes on October 1, 2020, October 1, 2025 and October 1, 2030 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus unpaid interest, if any, accrued to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

MANAGER'S  SUGGESTION




                If you have any questions about the items you wish to store, consult the manager of the self-storage facility before you pack and arrive at the site.

SAFE STORAGE TIPS - SOME CONTENTS NOT SUITABLE FOR STORAGE UNITS.


        When making business or personal storage plans, consider that all storage facilities have restrictions on what they will allow you to store. This is for your own protection as well as that of the facility staff and other self-storage customers. As a general rule, any item or material that is considered "inherently dangerous" will not be allowed inside your storage rental. We've gathered below the most common items our customers ask us about. If you're not sure if an item is allowed, ask your store manager before you move into your storage unit.
    



Combustible, Flammable, Hazardous or Toxic Materials
Tires and Vehicles
Medical/Pharmaceutical Supplies and Equipment
Construction Equipment
Perishable Foods and Animal Products
MiscellaneousProhibited Items





Combustible, Flammable, Hazardous or Toxic Materials

                    Considered “inherently dangerous,” these include gasoline, compressed gas, propane tanks, kerosene, lamp and motor oil, acid, 
                    grease, corrosives, fertilizers, paint, cleaners, chemicals, narcotics, or hazardous, toxic or biological waste. 
                    Asbestos or products containing asbestos are not allowed. You also cannot store fireworks or explosives.
                








Combustible, Flammable, Hazardous or Toxic Materials

                Considered “inherently dangerous,” these include gasoline, compressed gas, propane tanks, kerosene, lamp and motor oil, acid, 
                grease, corrosives, fertilizers, paint, cleaners, chemicals, narcotics, or hazardous, toxic or biological waste. 
                Asbestos or products containing asbestos are not allowed. You also cannot store fireworks or explosives.
            





Tires and Vehicles

                Storing vehicles is generally acceptable, as long as they are registered, insured and in operational condition. 
                Most facilities will not let you store more than four tires in your self-storage unit because of the cost to dispose of them.
            





Medical/Pharmaceutical Supplies and Equipment

                If you are a sales representative, you may find a self-storage unit a convenient place to manage medical supplies and pharmaceutical samples. 
                It is a useful way to keep your products organized and easily accessible without cluttering up your office or filling your car trunk. While most supplies are acceptable, radioactive equipment – or anything that contains radioactive materials – cannot legally be stored.
            





Construction Equipment

                If you work in construction, it’s convenient to stop by your storage unit on the way to the site and pick up necessary equipment. 
                However, please check with the self-storage facility before planning to store any construction equipment. Some construction equipment is prohibited.
            





Perishable Food and Animal Products

                Canned foods may be stored in storage units, but perishable food products such as pet food, produce or meats are not allowed. These may spoil or attract pests.
            





Miscellaneous Prohibited Items

                Any animals or plants – alive or dead – cannot be stored. Nor can any stolen items. 
                People are not allowed to plug in or use refrigerators, freezers, generators, space heaters or live in storage units.

Holiday Storage Tips and Tricks
The key to putting away and storing holiday decorations is to take the decorations down in reverse order. The things you took out and put up last should be put away first – and vice versa...




Beating the Winter Blues
Are you one of those people who made a New Year's resolution to organize and declutter? If you did, the seemingly endless winter evenings of February are a great time to go through your family photos, choosing which ones could be stored in a storage unit or closet and which you would like to display in a family photo album or digital picture slide show...



Spring Cleaning
Why do people always assume that spring is the best time for cleaning? The reason is simple – storage rotation. In many parts of the world, the seasons are about to change dramatically – and that means pulling stuff out of storage – everything from seasonal wardrobes to seasonal tools such as lawnmowers and gardening tools.

"This service is a dream! They pack it up, store it and if you need your stuff, they bring it to you. No schlepping to a storage unit. No lugging boxes to my small car or renting a truck. They do everything! I cannot believe how amazing this service is!"




















- E.P. on Yelp








"I just used Clutter today and boy did it make all the difference during a stressful situation. They showed up early, were super professional, and fast. A really cool concept for short-term storage and moving. I've used movers/storage facilities in multiple states including a different one in LA and this was by far my best experience!"

5x5 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  5'x5' storage unit is about the size of a walk-in closet. This size is ideal for holding a small mattress set, a chair or dresser, sports equipment, or a few extra boxes. Renting a storage unit this size could help you free up a cluttered spare room or store seasonal items.
READ MORE












5x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 5'x10'  storage unit can hold a queen-size bed, a few chairs and a dresser, and extra storage boxes. Drop off a TV or other large appliances, or park your bike inside a safe, clean spot for the winter. You can even store a desk or extra office equipment. Most units have eight foot ceilings, so a little space goes a long way.  If your home or apartment is getting a little too cozy, a five by ten unit from Extra Space Storage could be the answer for you.
READ MORE












10x10 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x10' unit can hold about as much as an entire family room, or two extra bedrooms. Load in a mattress set, bookcases, tables and dressers. Or pack away that old couch, or set aside old books or appliances you're no longer using. This space is a great way to keep your things safe, secure, and clean.  A ten by ten unit can also hold the contents of an entire office, including desks, chairs, files, and storage boxes.
READ MORE












10x15 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A  10'x15' storage unit provides plenty of room to store larger items such as pianos, couches, tables, or big screen TVs. Most units have eight foot ceilings, giving you plenty of room to stack things up. A ten by fifteen unit gives you a secure, tidy spot to safeguard all your goods. It's like having three spare bedrooms that are available whenever you need them.
READ MORE












10x20 STORAGE UNIT GUIDE
A 10'x20' gives you two hundred square feet of room - that's enough to store the contents of a five-bedroom house. Large appliances are no problem for a ten by twenty unit. Drop off your refrigerator, washer and dryer, or dining room set. Roll in a pool table, or box up all your office paperwork and tax files for secure storage.  With eight foot ceilings these large spaces will give you plenty of room for storage - whether you need to stack things up or organize for easy access.

September 1, 2016

Jeff

Today is September 1, my payments are due on the 1st. Why is it that when I pull up my unit it to pay my bill it shows past due. That is causes me to get angry, it is a stupid policy and it is totally unprofessional to say I am past due when I pay on the due date! There is nothing that says I am required to pay before my due date nor is it a smart marketing plan. Why would I pay before my due date? Offer me $10 off for paying early and I will consider it, but I am NOT past due if I pay at 8am on the 1st day of the month, when the payment and contract say I am due to make a payment. If it is due on the first, I will pay on the 1st and therefore it is paid on time, correct? It seems like a simple programing item to show people past due on the 2nd of the month, doesn't it? Finally, my unit is supposed to be 10x10 and it is 10x8.5!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
