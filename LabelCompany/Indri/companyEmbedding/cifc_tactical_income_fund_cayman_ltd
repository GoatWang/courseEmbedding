CDs offer FDIC insurance,3 providing a guarantee of the invested principal up to certain limits.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.
Research investment grade bond funds



Municipal

Invest in bonds issued by state governments and municipalities. While they tend to offer lower yields, the income they generate is generally free from federal income taxes.* Learn more about types of municipal bond funds.
Research municipal bond funds



High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

Invest in a mix of taxable bonds, including both high yield and investment grade securities issued by the U.S. and by foreign governments, as well as domestic and foreign corporations, giving investors the ability to create a diversified fixed income portfolio through a single fund. Learn more about multisector bond funds.
Research multisector bond funds



International & global

International bond funds invest in a range of taxable bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. Global bond funds invest in bonds from around the world, including bonds issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. Learn more about types of international and global bond funds.

Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

			A money market fund is a type of fixed income mutual fund that invests in debt securities that are characterized by their short maturities and minimal credit risk.

These may include short-term U.S. Treasury securities, federal agency notes, Eurodollar deposits, repurchase agreements, certificates of deposit, corporate commercial paper; or obligations of states, cities, or other types of municipal agencies.

Fidelity Fund News & Analysis




Fidelity fund prices & documents



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.


          1.
	
	
	       
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.


          2.
	
	
	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

CIFC LLC Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year of 2015 Results and a $0.34 Distribution




















March 21, 2016 17:00 ET

 | Source: CIFC Corp.






NEW YORK, March  21, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CIFC LLC (NASDAQ:CIFC) (“CIFC” or the “Company”) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2015.  Highlights The Company successfully completed its reorganization to a publicly traded limited liability company ("Reorganization Transaction"). Fee Earning Assets Under Management ("Fee Earning AUM" or "AUM") was $14.1 billion as of December 31, 2015 as compared to $14.2 billion as of September 30, 2015 and $13.7 billion as of December 31, 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company sponsored the issuance of one new CLO, was appointed the sub-adviser to two new loan funds (one each in Asia and Europe) and increased subscriptions to existing funds for an aggregate of $0.6 billion of new AUM. During 2015, the Company sponsored the issuance of five new CLOs, launched four new funds and increased subscriptions to existing funds for an aggregate of $3.0 billion of new AUM.  Management fees increased 10% quarter over quarter from $14.8 million to $16.3 million and 9% year over year from $57.3 million to $62.5 million. Economic Net Income ("ENI," a non-GAAP measure) for the quarter and full year was $4.3 million and $31.4 million, respectively, as compared to $3.3 million and $36.1 million for the same periods in the prior year. GAAP net income (loss) for the quarter and full year was $(7.7) million and $0.3 million, respectively, as compared to $0.8 million and $8.4 million for the same periods in the prior year. CIFC's board of directors declared an aggregate cash distribution of $0.34 per share; composed of a quarterly cash distribution of $0.10 per share and a special distribution of $0.24 per share issued in relation to the Reorganization Transaction. The distribution will be paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 1, 2016.  Executive Overview  The past year proved to be the most challenging for the leveraged credit market since the end of the financial crisis. Commodity prices came under pressure over the summer and risk assets sold off starting in August. The U.S. High Yield Market was down 5% and the U.S. Corporate Loan market recorded its first negative total return since 2008. Our balance sheet investments in CIFC-managed funds outperformed their respective benchmarks. Both the Senior Secured Corporate Loan Fund and the Tactical Income Fund produced positive returns vis-à-vis losses in both the CS Loan Index and the LSTA Loan Index. The pronounced weakness in the CLO market led to a decline in mark-to-market valuation of our balance sheet CLO investments. Consequently, net investment income dropped to $1.9 million compared with $14.1 million in 2014. Excluding investment income, we increased ENI EBITDA by $7.2 million or 26% year-over-year. In 2015, we were successful in sponsoring 5 new CLOs for a combined AUM of $2.6 billion. Strong equity sponsorship allowed us to issue all 5 transactions on a non-risk retention compliant basis. We are well capitalized to issue risk retention compliant CLOs. We successfully completed a 10-year $40 million senior unsecured bond offering in the fourth quarter to further bolster our capacity to invest in risk retention compliant CLOs. We have $210.4 million of cash and investments on our balance sheet, most of which will be available for risk retention compliance over the next 3 years. Our total return corporate credit loan business has outperformed the various leveraged loan indices (S&P LSTA, CS LL & JPM LL) since inception, for three consecutive years. We successfully launched three new funds; including our first white-labeled loan funds in Korea and Switzerland. The AUM of our credit fund platform now exceeds $1.0 billion. Our loan portfolios continue to perform well and defaults continue to be substantially lower compared to the loan indices. We have maintained our rigorous underwriting process and actively managed risk across well-diversified portfolios. We first started to cut our energy exposure in late August and early September of 2014 and continue to be defensively positioned. We remain underweight the sector with current exposure below 3%. CLO issuance has been slow during the course of the first two months of 2016. Forecasts from various banks expect market conditions to improve in the second half of the year. We are well positioned to access the market once conditions become more compelling. Loan prepayment rates have slowed significantly. We expect loan prepayment rates to remain lower until CLO new issuance volumes return, increasing the duration of our existing CLO AUM. We are taking advantage of lower loan prices to build par in our 2.0 CLOs. We expect the current investment opportunity to drive improved returns and with that, potentially higher incentive fees on our existing CLOs in the future.

For year ended December 31, 2014, the convertible notes were anti-dilutive and excluded from the numerator in the dilution calculation.(4) GAAP weighted average shares outstanding was used as ENI weighted average shares outstanding.(5) ENI EBITDA is ENI before corporate interest expense and depreciation of fixed assets. See Appendix.(6) ENI EBITDA Margin is ENI EBITDA divided by Total ENI Revenue. ENI Margin is ENI divided by Total ENI Revenue. (7) Amount excludes Fee Earning AUM attributable to non-core products of $592.8 million, $621.9 million and $687.6 million as of December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Fee Earning AUM attributable to non-core products are expected to continue to decline as these funds run-off per their contractual terms.(8) The Company early adopted the amendments of Accounting Standard Update "ASU" 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ("ASU 2015-02"). The adoption was applied on a modified retroactive basis, resulting in the deconsolidation of 30 CLOs and 1 credit fund as of January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we consolidated 2 CLOs and 2 credit funds. As of December 31, 2014, we consolidated 31 CLOs, 1 warehouse, and 2 credit funds.  Year over year, our GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations will not be comparative for certain line items (e.g. Total net revenues). Fourth Quarter Overview CIFC reported ENI of $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to $3.3 million for the same quarter in the prior year. ENI increased quarter over quarter by $1.0 million or 31%. Quarter over quarter, management fees increased from continued AUM growth year over year and incentive fees increased as four CLOs were called during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, Employee Compensation and Benefits decreased as a result of reductions in incentive-based compensation quarter over quarter. Offsetting the increases in ENI were (i) decreases in net investment income primarily related to an increase of $11.1 million in unrealized losses as a result of significant declines in market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year, (ii) increases in corporate interest related to the issuance of $40.0 million unsecured senior notes and (iii) increases in share based compensation related to amortization of equity awards granted since 2014. CIFC reported GAAP net loss attributable to the Company of $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2015, as compared to net income of $0.8 million in the same period of the prior year. GAAP operating results decreased $8.4 million from the same period of the prior year primarily due to (i) a $10.8 million increase in income taxes primarily related to higher taxable income and the Reorganization Transaction, (ii) a $4.2 million increase in compensation expense related to  incentive fee sharing arrangements with former employees for acquired CLOs from Columbus Nova Credit Investments Management, LLC ("CNCIM") and (iii) a $0.8 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the Reorganization Transaction. These decreases were offset by (i) a $1.0 million increase in ENI, as noted above (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP ENI), (ii) a $5.5 million increase in incentive fees earned on certain Legacy CLOs with fee sharing agreements (GAAP represents fees gross of fee sharing) and (iii) decreases in amortization and impairment of intangible assets of $0.4 million related to impairments and write offs in previous years. Fiscal Year Overview CIFC reported ENI of $31.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $36.1 million for the prior year. ENI decreased year over year by $4.7 million or 13%. Year over year ENI decreased primarily because, (i) net investment income decreased by $12.3 million to $1.9 million, primarily related to an increase of $13.5 million in unrealized losses resulting from significant declines in the market value of loans and CLO securities compared to the prior year and (ii) share based compensation increased due to amortization of equity awards granted since 2013. Offsetting these decreases in ENI were increases in management fees from continued AUM growth year over year in credit funds and incentive fees from CLOs called during 2015. CIFC reported GAAP net income attributable to the Company of $0.3 million for year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to $8.4 million in prior year. GAAP operating results decreased by $8.0 million, or 96%, from the same period of the prior year primarily due to (i) a $4.7 million decrease in ENI, as noted above (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures section for a reconciliation between GAAP and Non-GAAP ENI), (ii) a $3.7 million increase in compensation expense related to incentive fee sharing arrangements with former employees for acquired CLOs from CNCIM, (iii) a $2.1 million increase in professional fees primarily related to the Reorganization Transaction and (iv) a $3.1 million increase in income taxes primarily related to higher taxable income and the Reorganization Transaction. These decreases were offset by (i) a $2.8 million increase in incentive fees earned on certain Legacy CLOs with fee sharing agreements (GAAP presents fees gross of fee sharing) and (ii) a $1.9 million reduction in intangible asset amortization compared to the prior year as certain CLO and CDO management contracts were written off in the prior year. Fee Earning AUM Fee Earning AUM or AUM refers to the assets managed by the Company on which we receive management fees and/or incentive based fees. Generally, with respect to CLOs, management fees are paid to the Company based on the aggregate collateral balance at par plus principal cash, and with respect to Non-CLO funds, the value of the assets in such funds. The following table summarizes Fee Earning AUM for the Company's loan-based products:   December 31, 2015 September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014(in thousands, except # of Accounts) (1)(2)   # of Accounts Fee Earning AUM # of Accounts Fee Earning AUM # of Accounts Fee Earning AUMPost 2011 CLOs 18  $9,860,519  17  $9,388,022  13  $7,402,986 Legacy CLOs (3) 10  2,559,066  14  3,253,869  19  4,960,877   Total CLOs 28  12,419,585  31  12,641,891  32  12,363,863 Credit Funds (4) 12  1,062,712  10  941,035  8  593,456 Other Loan-Based Products (4) 2  573,190  2  633,290  2  719,170   Total Non-CLOs (4) 14  $1,635,902  12  $1,574,325  10  $1,312,626 AUM from loan-based products 42  $14,055,487  43  $14,216,216  42  $13,676,489  Explanatory Notes: (1) Table excludes Fee Earning AUM attributable to non-core products of $592.8 million, $621.9 million and $687.6 million as of December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Fee Earning AUM attributable to non-core products is expected to continue to decline as these funds run-off per their contractual terms.(2) Fee Earning AUM is based on the latest available monthly report issued by the trustee or fund administrator prior to the end of the period, and may not tie back to the Consolidated GAAP financial statements.(3) Legacy CLOs represent all managed CLOs issued prior to 2011, including CLOs acquired since 2011 but issued prior to 2011.(4) Management fees for Non-CLO products vary by fund and may not be similar to a CLO. Since 2012, CIFC has raised $11.4 billion of new AUM through organic growth, which has more than offset the run-off from Legacy CLOs (including acquired CLOs). Our Legacy CLO AUM of $2.6 billion is less than a fifth of our total CLO AUM of $12.4 billion and we anticipate it will run off over the next three years.

Balance Sheet Highlights During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $32.6 million of adjusted cash flows from operations. We raised $40.0 million through debt issuance and invested $60.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, we held total cash and investments of $210.4 million comprised of total cash of $58.0 million and investments of $152.4 million with no debt maturing until October 2025.

Gains or losses may be netted against the Company's equity contribution depending on whether warehouse assets are transferred at market value or cost. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2014, most warehouse investments that we manage have been made though the Warehouse Fund, a closed-end structured credit fund.(2) Primarily includes investment in CIFC's Tactical Income Fund, which may be redeemed with 60 days' notice on the last day of each calendar quarter. Appendix Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Company discloses financial measures that are calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“Non-GAAP”) as follows: ENI is a non-GAAP financial measure of profitability which management uses in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC to measure the performance of our core business (excluding non-core products). We believe ENI reflects the nature and substance of the business, the economic results driven by management fee revenues from the management of client funds and earnings on our investments. ENI represents GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC LLC excluding (i) income taxes, (ii) merger and acquisition related items including fee-sharing arrangements, amortization and impairments of intangible assets and gain (loss) on contingent consideration for earn-outs, (iii) non-cash compensation related to profits interests granted by CIFC Parent Holdings LLC in June 2011, (iv) revenues attributable to non-core investment products, (v) advances for fund organizational expenses, and (vi) certain other items as detailed. The Deconsolidated Non-GAAP Statements represent the Consolidated GAAP statements adjusted to eliminate the impact of the Consolidated Entities. On the Statement of Operations, the Company has reclassified the sum of Net results of Consolidated Entities, Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in Consolidated Entities and Net gain (loss) on investments to the Deconsolidated Non-GAAP line items that represent its characteristics: management fees and incentive fees, and interest income. Management uses these Non-GAAP statements in addition to Consolidated GAAP Statements to measure the performance of its core asset management business. ENI EBITDA is also a non-GAAP financial measure that management considers, in addition to GAAP Net income (loss) attributable to CIFC Corp., to evaluate the Company's core performance. ENI EBITDA represents ENI before corporate interest expense and depreciation of fixed assets, a non-cash item. ENI and ENI EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as they are non-GAAP financial measures that are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore may be defined differently by other companies. In addition, ENI and ENI EBITDA should be considered as an addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A detailed calculation of ENI and ENI EBITDA and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure is included in the Appendix.

			Fixed income investments generally pay a return on a fixed schedule, though the amount of the payments can vary. Individual bonds may be the best known type of fixed income security, but the category also includes bond funds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.

														In a study conducted by Corporate Insight, our bond pricing beat markup-based brokers by an average of $13 per trade online. That could add up to a cost savings of hundreds of dollars on a typical bond order.2










Largest selection of bonds and CDs offered at a single firm





Individual Bonds


Bonds make interest payments and repay the principal on a fixed schedule. Interest and principal payments are subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer.






Bond Funds


Bond mutual funds invest primarily in individual bonds. Many make periodic dividend payments based on the interest paid by the bonds held in the fund.






Fixed Income ETFs


Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of investments that trade as a single unit throughout the day.












Certificates of Deposit (CDs)


CDs offer FDIC insurance,3 providing a guarantee of the invested principal up to certain limits.






Money Market Funds


Money market funds are managed to help preserve your principal by investing in lower-risk debt securities with shorter maturities.




Deferred Fixed Annuities4

Deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed5 rate of return over a set time period, with tax deferral.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.
Research investment grade bond funds



Municipal

Invest in bonds issued by state governments and municipalities. While they tend to offer lower yields, the income they generate is generally free from federal income taxes.* Learn more about types of municipal bond funds.
Research municipal bond funds



High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

Invest in a mix of taxable bonds, including both high yield and investment grade securities issued by the U.S. and by foreign governments, as well as domestic and foreign corporations, giving investors the ability to create a diversified fixed income portfolio through a single fund. Learn more about multisector bond funds.
Research multisector bond funds



International & global

International bond funds invest in a range of taxable bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. Global bond funds invest in bonds from around the world, including bonds issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. Learn more about types of international and global bond funds.

This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.

Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.


          2.
	
	
	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
