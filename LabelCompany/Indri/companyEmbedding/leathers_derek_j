Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code).

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Leathers, Ottensmeyer tapped for CEO positions at Werner, Kansas City Southern
Seasoned executives with deep experience in Mexico get the corner offices.
By DC Velocity Staff



 Comment




Two highly regarded transportation-industry executives were elevated to their respective companies' strategic chairs.
Effective immediately, Derek J. Leathers has been named CEO of truckload and logistics giant Werner Enterprises Inc. Leathers, 46, succeeds Clarence L. Werner, the company's founder, who will remain the company's executive chairman. Leathers will continue as president, but relinquish the chief operating officer's role to H. Marty Nordlund, 54, who was promoted to senior vice president and COO, Omaha-based Werner said.
The elder Werner, 78, returned to the company in August as temporary CEO after son Gregory L. Werner decided to retire. At the time of his return, it was telegraphed that Leathers would eventually become the first non-Werner CEO in the company's 60-year history.
Meanwhile, Kansas City Southern (KCS) yesterday tapped Patrick Ottensmeyer, currently president of the Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad concern, to become its CEO, effective July 1. As with Leathers at Werner, Ottensmeyer, 59, will also retain the president's title at KCS. And as with Leathers, Ottensmeyer's ascension was telegraphed as part of KCS' succession plan.
Another parallel between the two men is their deep experience in the Mexican market. After eight years at top posts at rival Schneider National Inc.'s Mexican unit, Leathers joined Werner in 1999 to run its Mexican operations. He became COO in 2008 and president in 2011. Ottensmeyer, who joined KCS in 2006 as executive vice president and CFO, is deeply enmeshed in Mexico because KCS' north-south network has heavy penetration in the country.
In a statement, KCS' board lauded Ottensmeyer for his work over the past year in strengthening the railroad's operations, a critical aspect of KCS' value proposition in serving a country like Mexico whose rail infrastructure is evolving. The board also noted Ottensmeyer's strong personal relationships with customers, investors, other rail executives, and employees on both sides of the border.
At Werner, it is unclear how much input its founder will continue to have in the company's strategic and tactical endeavors. C.L. Werner, who was also the first driver, has long been considered a hands-on chief executive, and his return last August was by no means ceremonial. Leathers, one of the trucking industry's most dynamic executives, is probably the only non-family member to which the elder Werner would entrust the future of the company.
Werner yesterday made another appointment that may actually be the most relevant to its day-to-day operations. Jim S. Schelble, 55, was promoted to executive vice president and chief administrative officer, responsible for driver recruitment; Werner's driver-school network; safety; pricing; human resources; and corporate communications. Schelble will be Werner's point man in the fight to attract and retain qualified commercial truck drivers, a problem that disproportionately affects the industry's largest fleets, including Werner.
Leathers has cited the continuing undersupply of drivers as one of the factors behind his forecast of a considerable tightening of truckload capacity in 2017.

Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
