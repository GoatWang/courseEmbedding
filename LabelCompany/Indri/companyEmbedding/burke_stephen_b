Early life[edit]
Steve Burke is an Irish Catholic. His father, Daniel B. Burke was a former president of Capital Cities Communications, former owner of the ABC network.[3] He graduated from Colgate University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and earned an MBA from the Harvard Business School.
Business[edit]
Burke joined The Walt Disney Company in January 1986, where he helped to develop and found The Disney Stores.[3] In 1992, he moved to Euro Disney S.A., where, as President and CEO, he helped to lead a comprehensive restructuring effort. He later served as President of ABC Broadcasting.
In 1998, Burke joined Comcast as President of Comcast Cable. Since then, Comcast has become the largest cable company, largest residential internet service provider, third largest phone company in America and launched a wireless business. He led Comcast to leadership in multi-platform video entertainment distribution, including the Company's industry changing video on demand platform and online video offerings. He has been praised for leading the highly successful integration of AT&T Broadband with Comcast.[4]
Burke currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of NBCUniversal. He oversees the company's valuable portfolio of news, sports, and entertainment networks, a premier motion picture company, significant television production operations, a leading television stations group, and theme parks. Burke assumed this role in January 2011, upon the closing of Comcast and General Electric’s joint venture merging the assets of NBCUniversal with Comcast's programming assets. He previously served as Chief Operating Officer of Comcast Corporation, where he was a driving force in its growth from a cable industry leader to one of the nation’s leading providers of entertainment, information and communication products and services.

Biography



    Stephen B. Burke has been Chief Executive Officer of NBCUniversal, LLC, and a senior executive of Comcast Corporation, one of the U.S.'s leading providers of entertainment, information and communication products and services, since January 2011. He was Chief Operating Officer of Comcast Corporation from 2004 until 2011, and President of Comcast Cable Communications, Inc. from 1998 until January 2010. Before joining Comcast, Mr. Burke served with The Walt Disney Company as President of ABC Broadcasting. He joined The Walt Disney Company in January 1986, and helped develop and found The Disney Store and lead a comprehensive restructuring of Euro Disney S.A. Mr. Burke's roles at Comcast, ABC, and Euro Disney have given him broad exposure to the challenges associated with managing large and diverse businesses. In those roles he has dealt with a variety of issues including audit and financial reporting, risk management, executive compensation, sales and marketing, and technology and operations. His tenure at Comcast and ABC gave him experience working in regulated industries, and his work at Euro Disney gave him a background in international business. Mr. Burke has been a director of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. since 2009. Mr. Burke graduated from Colgate University and received an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.

Under Steve Burke, Old-Media NBCUniversal Shows Off Some New Tricks

With its movie studio, broadcast television network and theme parks, Comcast-owned NBCUniversal sits squarely in the geriatric old-media camp of Disney, Viacom, CBS, 21st Century Fox and Time Warner, all of which are struggling to varying degrees with the digital revolution and innovative upstarts like Netflix.But Comcast startled investors and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media. Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of so-called cord cutters by adding video subscribers, but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or Google’s parent, Alphabet.Universal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent. Over all, NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent. Comcast doesn’t break out earnings for NBCUniversal, but operating cash flow rose 8.7 percent.Since 2009, when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric (an acquisition completed five years ago), NBCUniversal’s cash flow has doubled. The NBC television network, which had been in fourth place for so long (seven years) that many doubted it could be resurrected, is the leading network for the coveted 18-to-49 age group, powered by high ratings for “Sunday Night Football” and “The Voice.” Strong franchises “NBC Nightly News” and “Today” have recouped the top spots in the ratings that had been threatened by scandal (Brian Williams at “Nightly News”) and a tearful on-air departure (Ann Curry at “Today”).

Universal Studios, ranked fifth out of six Hollywood studios when Comcast bought it, was the top studio last year with record-breaking revenue and three blockbusters — “Jurassic World,” “Furious 7” and “Minions” — that topped $1 billion at the box office. The Universal theme parks, long overshadowed by Disney’s, introduced the hugely popular Harry Potter attraction and have doubled revenue since 2010. Continue reading the main story

I sat down this week with Steve Burke, chief executive of NBCUniversal, in his spacious, light-filled office at NBCUniversal’s headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Despite the pressures of running a media giant with $28.5 billion in revenue, he looks younger than his age of 57 years. In our conversation, one thing stood out about NBCUniversal, which is true of all old-media companies: It’s all about the people. “This isn’t like manufacturing,” Mr. Burke said. “It’s about talent. If you get that wrong, the whole enterprise goes bad very quickly.”Mr. Burke grew up in broadcast television — his father, Dan Burke, was a former president of CapCities ABC, and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast, where he was president of the cable division, under the chairman and chief executive, Brian Roberts.

Today much of Mr. Burke’s time seems to be spent courting, coaxing, stroking, cajoling — and in some cases ejecting — high-paid, high-profile stars and executives, many with outsize egos. In 2011, Mr. Burke had to replace the prominent NBC Sports head, Dick Ebersol, just four weeks before the rights to the Sochi Olympics were auctioned.Last year, when the NBC Nightly news anchor, Brian Williams, acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq, Mr. Burke had to put their close friendship aside and deliver an in-person ultimatum to take a six-month leave without pay. (“Agonizing,” Mr. Burke told me.)He flew to California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno to negotiate the delicate transition to Jimmy Fallon as host of the “Tonight” show a year before Mr. Leno’s contract was set to expire.Still, dealing with stars like Mr. Leno and Mr. Fallon can’t be delegated. It was Mr. Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back to his production roots at Universal Studios. And some deals — NBC’s multibillion-dollar, nine-year extension of “Sunday Night Football,” for example — are so big they require the presence of Mr. Roberts, Mr. Burke’s boss.While Mr. Burke comes across as genial and low-key, he’s a demanding boss. Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr. Burke inherited from G.E., only four remain.

Early in his tenure, he summoned the top 200 managers to Orlando and told them they had to do better. “I had to be stern,” Mr. Burke said. “People thought everything was fine. It wasn’t. I had to paint reality. I ranked our top 10 businesses based on operating cash flow. Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile,” meaning they woefully lagged their competitors. He charged them to act like owners, not renters — which means to invest for the long term, to take responsibility and to fix problems themselves — a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card. It’s also one emphasized by Warren E. Buffett to the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr. Burke serves on the board. (Disclosure: I’m a weekly contributor to CNBC, the NBCUniversal-owned business channel.)Tom Williams, chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks & Resorts, has been at Universal for 46 years. “The previous mentality was, How can we take cash out of the business?” Mr. Williams said. “Comcast encouraged, even mandated, reinvestment. We’ve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers. Steve and Brian have said, ‘Keep reinvesting.’ The returns are stellar.”

Talking of Comcast and Viacom


James B. Stewart, appearing on CNBC, described the situation in Viacom as "King Lear in the board room" and also discussed strong earnings at Comcast.

Universal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan, is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in Beijing.With NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders, Mr. Burke has been able to turn his attention to the digital revolution. He said he was looking to hire digital talent, had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica, also known as Silicon Beach. The company has taken $200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox Media, and has started Seeso, a digital comedy channel.“It’s my biggest challenge,” he said. “Big media made the transition from broadcast to cable. But we were still dealing with channels. Now we have to move to digital. Digital is different. The DNA doesn’t already reside in the company.”

At the same time, new media is moving onto NBCUniversal’s turf. Netflix and Amazon have made big splashes with original programming, and the two emerged this year as the biggest buyers at the Sundance Film Festival. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, donned a tuxedo for the Golden Globes, where Amazon’s “Mozart in the Jungle” won this year for best television series in the musical or comedy category.Investors have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown: Comcast stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18; Netflix’s is 324 and Amazon’s is 425, meaning that investors are anticipating much higher growth at those companies.Still, as old and new media converge, and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance, it may be worth asking how much old-media DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg, Mr. Bezos and Larry Page, their respective chief executives, aren’t primarily known for their people skills, let alone the ability to cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV stars.Mr. Burke typically shuns the spotlight, and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversal’s recent success and momentum. He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclical.Still, it’s obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal. “I’m a product of my dad’s influence at CapCities ABC, my time at Disney, and then at Comcast,” Mr. Burke said. “I developed all these theories about how to run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity to try them.”

 Correction: February 5, 2016  
        An earlier version of this column misstated Mr. Burke’s title at Comcast. He is senior executive vice president, not president.

@YourMamaTweets 










SELLER: Steve BurkeLOCATION: Philadelphia, PAPRICE: $5,200,000SIZE: 8,120 square feet, 5 bedrooms, 6 full and 3 half bathrooms
YOUR MAMAS NOTES: Much to the self-serving chagrin of many, we’re sure, Your Mama unilaterally decided that, today, rather than dis and discuss the real estate affairs of some over-exposed reality television denizen or a misbehaving super star or international film legend, we’d like to discuss powerful and influential entertainment industry executive Steve Burke. Not only did he quietly acquire a nearly nine million dollar house in Los Angeles in December (2012) but he and his missus, Gretchen, also—as we first learned from real estate yenta Yolanda Yakketyyak—own an elegant, mansion-sized row house in downtown Philadelphia that’s currently on the open market with an asking price of $5.2 million.







Mister Burke, formerly the well-compensate COO of the cable t.v. and internet services conglomerate Comcast, became the even better compensated head honcho CEO of NBC Universal in January of 2011 after a much ballyhood merger between the cable and media juggernauts. The veteran executive was launched to the top of the industry gossip pyramid last fall when he and his team botched the unceremonious firing of a long-time NBC Universal executive named Adam Fogelson. Now, before some of y’all get your knickers all up in an indignant twist, Your Mama knows that probably nobody in Peoria, Panama City, or Pawnee gives a shit about the Misters Burke and Fogelson and/or their bad professional blood but, make no mistake, butter beans, in Tinseltown this was a much reported on and tittered about topic at all the best Showbiz power lunch eateries that cater to industry insiders. Still don’t care? Well, too bad. Have a gin and tonic and take a nerve pill and just try to enjoy the photos and the floor plans, okay?
Mister Burke, in his early 50s and still handsome in that clean-cut middle-aged former frat guy sort of way, purchased the historic red brick row house near Philadelphia’s picturesque Rittenhouse Square in August 2010 for $5.85 million. It was, according to local property gossips, the most ever paid for such a property in downtown Philadelphia.
Current digital marketing materials show the five floor Georgian—there are four floors above ground plus a finished basement, all serviced by a wood-paneled elevator—stretches about 26 feet wide and spans 8,120 square feet with five bedrooms, six full and three half bathrooms, and half a dozen fireplaces.

Floor plans included with online listings show a raised stoop entry opens into a large entry with built-in window bench, wood floors, and an impressive staircase with lots of elaborately turned spindles. The street-facing formal living room has a fireplace and the formal dining room—the Burkes appear to have furnished it as a sitting room in listing photos—has an ornamented barrel vaulted ceiling. A full wall of bookcases fitted with leaded glass doors also opens on the back side in the dining area of the expensively outfitted and cook-friendly eat-in kitchen at the rear of the house.







On the lower level, in addition to a (windowless) fitness room, a three-quarter hall bath, and several impressive storage rooms and a walk-in wine storage space, there’s an attached, alley-accessed two-car garage. Think about how desirable an attached two-car garage in the middle of downtown Philadelphia is to a wealthy, city-dwelling Philadelphian who prefers their own Mercedes or Maserati to the SEPTA. Anyways…
A bedroom-sized, bookcase-lined, and all-paneled library plus a larger family room (with fireplace) and a compact half bathroom in the hallway share the roomy row house’s second floor with the master suite. The decent-sized but hardly huge master bedroom has a fireplace and direct access to a private deck. There’s also a fitted walk-in closet/dressing room and a compartmentalized bathroom equipped with two sinks, a free-standing soaking tub, separate glassed-in steam shower and a wee dry sauna.
Each of the three bedrooms on the third floor have private attached bathrooms. The smallest gets no extra special amenities but the medium sized one has a fireplace and a small dressing area and the largest one, which stretches the full width of the house, not only has a fireplace but a fitted walk-in closet. A fourth family/guest bedroom on the fourth floor is identically sized and laid out as the largest bedroom the third floor. Also on the top floor is another pint-sized powder pooper in the hall and, at the back of the house, a wet-bar equipped media alcove and an adjoining sitting room with built-in book cases and French door access to a city view roof deck.
Mister and Missus Burke, who have five children, may have set a record sale price when they purchased their mid-city row house but, with it’s current $5.2 million asking price, the West Coast-bound Burkes stand to loose a good-sized bundle of money, even if they manage to pull in a full price buyer. Indeed, as per Your Mama’s bejeweled abacus, Mister and Missus Burke are looking at a bank account brutalizing $650,000 loss, not counting carrying costs, improvement expenses, and real estate fees.
Money, however, doesn’t seem to be too much of an issue for Mister and Missus Burke, bless their financial hearts. Even though they’re looking at a hefty loss in Philadelphia they still have the wherewithal to keep a huge spread in New York City—more on that later—and spend—as we also first heard from Yolanda Yakettyyak and confirmed with property records—$8,700,000 on a newly built mansion in L.A.’s Brentwood area. Listing details described the white, clapboard-sided house as a “New England Trad” that sits on almost a third of an acre in a discreet but decidedly affluent and—obviously—exceedingly expensive neighborhood and is conveniently located walking distance to The Brentwood Country Mart.

The children will note that listing details (and other reports) show Mister and Missus Burke’s row house in Philly measures 8,120 square feet and listing details Your Mama turned up for their new house in Los Angeles shows it, too, has 8,120 square feet. Spooky or just a cute coinky-dink? You decide.
Listing details Your Mama turned up show the Colonial-esque residence has a total of six bedrooms and 6.5, one of each of which is comprise a staff suite in the finished basement area. The airy interior spaces were finished with furniture grade built-ins, quarter and rift sawn oak floors throughout, and feature vaulted wood ceilings and marble bathrooms.
There are, as is expected in a house of this size and price, a foyer that will impress guests, formal living and dining rooms, and a wood-paneled library. Less formal family quarters include an large eat-in kitchen with breakfast area, separate mud room, and an adjoining family room that opens to the backyard. Downstairs, in the finished basement, along with the staff bedroom and bathroom, there’s a screening room with wet bar, a wine room, a powder room, and a laundry room with dual washers and dryers, probably handy for a family with five children. The landscaped backyard has large terraces and patios, one with a fire pit, a built-in barbecue set up, and a heated swimming pool and spa.
In New York City, Mister and Missus Burke own a large, terraced apartment in the same Arts and Crafts-y Upper West Side building where Madonna lived in a meandering multi-unit combo before she decamped to her triple wide townhouse on the Upper East Side. The Burke’s, higher floor urban aerie is a combination of three apartments that property records and reports from the time show Mister and Missus Burke purchased in separate transaction between early May and late July in 2011.
First they paid $11.75 million for a large and lovely if somewhat quirkily laid out four bedroom and three bathroom apartment with a slender, 65-ish foot long terrace with sweeping views over Central Park to Fifth Avenue. Quick on the heels of that came the $2.95 off-market acquisition of the apartment next door—of unknown size—and shortly after that the space-craving couple coughed up another $1.8 million for a third, contiguous apartment with one bedroom and one bathroom. A few quick tabulations on Your Mama’s bejeweled abacus reveals they spent a cool $16,500,000 to purchase the three apartments and we have to assume (without knowledge or proof) they’ve since spent a small fortune to combine them into one (hopefully cohesive), family-of-seven-sized sprawler. As of today the combo-crib is not listed on the open market but, of course, we don’t have any inside intel on the Burke’s future plans for the place.listing photos and floor plan (Philadelphia): Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Fox & Roachlisting photos (Los Angeles): Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices

I have been inside the Rittenhouse Square and the Harperly Hall townhouse. They are impressive and the view of Central Park and the NYC skyline is great. I would have liked to see the Brentwood one, but that is ok.

East Coast properties are impressive; the West? Not so much… a pale, awkward bulk.
Our Dear Rebbe’s take is spot on; funny how some commenters never actually comment on the topic, but rather just the other commenters?
What’s that about? Nothing else to say?

personally i like philly the few times ive been there. A manageable city with great squares, cultural opportunity and national history. The townhouse is a bit traditional for me but it’s beautifully done.
P.S. Hey you up there…At least the rabbi contributes to the conversation instead of whining like a punk ass bitch. If you think the rabbi’s third person reveals insecurity what do you think your anonymous sniping about her/him reveal about you? Nothing pretty, or secure or intelligent that’s for sure. 
Team Rabbi.

Anon 11:06 – The Rabbi provides a great deal of insight and information about the content on this site, and does so in what I find to be an engaging and compelling manner. Don’t like what she has to say?  Skip it, dude. Nobody likes a bully.  Especially a cyber-bully, who represent the nadir of the bullying world.  And it’s a shitty world.  You want to be that guy?   
The townhouse:  odd that there is no service staircase.

Shavua tov,good week, to Mama, the Kinderlach, and Anonymous January 24th at 5:12 p.m.:
Beautiful Georgian and Federal townhomes were built in Philadelphia and Baltimore and extraordinary fine furniture was manufactured in both cities.  Early Philadelphia “trinity” houses each consisted of three stories, one room and fireplace per floor, with an enclosed tightly-winding staircase.  Costlier houses, such as the Burke home, each included a side corridor and open staircase, with two rooms and two fireplaces per story.  Both types of homes were later expanded into their gardens.
In England during the mid-18th century, Thomas Chippendale published a book of furniture design.  The Chippendale style combined gothic and rococo elements, was copied throughout the 13 Colonies, and achieved its finest form in Philadelphia, the largest city within the Colonies.  
The Kinderlach might take a peek at the Winterthur Museum, Blackwell Parlor, to have a look at high living in pre-Revolutionary Philadelphia.  After Independence, U.S. architects and cabinet designers looked to the ancient democracy of Greece and the new democracy of France for inspiration.
The Rabbi’s familiarity of Philadelphia is personal, as she has been privileged to enjoy the interiors of many of the City’s privately restored homes, while her knowledge of Baltimore is limited to the artistry of John Waters and his associates.

I love Philly, it’s a great town. I wholeheartedly agree with the Rabbi, on the townhouse bargains, to be found there. Believe it or not, Baltimore also has some really wonderful old townhomes, steeped in history, as well.Back in the day, some of the finest furniture makers and craftsmen around, were found in each of those towns.

The Rabbi encourages you to check your spelling and dilduk (Hebrew grammar).  She understands your recommendation to close her mouth, while observing that you completely misspelled one word, omitted the letter “hey” in two words, and employed an article incorrectly.  The Rabbi wishes you a Good Shabbos.

The Philadelphia townhouse exudes perfection. Such a dignified body of work, surely created by the finest architects and craftspeople of that opulent era. Peeked the neighborhood. It’s a silver slipper district all the way. 
On melding the three units at Harperley Hall, I wonder if the sticker shock lessened by way of a healthy signing bonus for his New York promotion and relocation. It happens.

Wow! What a wonderful house! Excellent look and nice structure. The plan used to make this house is really fantastic and shows the talent of the builder. I have also bought a beautiful property in Almeria which consists of all these new settings along with wonderful views surrounding it. Anyone can buy it for their family and can live with all happiness. But your house is really incredible and it can give all the comfort for a family. I like your post and I ll tell this to my friend who was looking for this type of property. So thank you for sharing this with us. Keep it up.

The Rittenhouse Square townhome is absolutely beautiful.  Philadelphia is the last truly great city where one can still purchase a lovely townhouse, usually of the Federal era, on a quiet block in a very picturesque neighborhood, perhaps in Society Hill or Old City adjacent to downtown, for under one million dollars!  One simply needs to discard the old saw, “First prize: A week in Philadelphia.  Second prize: Two weeks in Philadelphia.”
The City of Brotherly Love has more parkland per capita than any other U.S. city, a spectacular fine art museum housed in the largest Greek temple edifice in the world, music, theater, sports, and a thriving LGBT community.
Harperley Hall at 41 Central Park West is also wonderful.  The apartments have beautiful woodwork and hardwood floors, fireplaces, balcony views of the park, and juxtaposition to Lincoln Center.
Alas that the Brentwood home, while probably containing the best of everything, appears to be entirely predictable.

Steve Burke is an Irish Catholic. His father, Daniel B. Burke was a former president of Capital Cities Communications, former owner of the ABC network.[3] He graduated from Colgate University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and earned an MBA from the Harvard Business School.

Burke joined The Walt Disney Company in January 1986, where he helped to develop and found The Disney Stores.[3] In 1992, he moved to Euro Disney S.A., where, as President and CEO, he helped to lead a comprehensive restructuring effort. He later served as President of ABC Broadcasting.

He oversees the company's valuable portfolio of news, sports, and entertainment networks, a premier motion picture company, significant television production operations, a leading television stations group, and theme parks. Burke assumed this role in January 2011, upon the closing of Comcast and General Electric’s joint venture merging the assets of NBCUniversal with Comcast's programming assets. He previously served as Chief Operating Officer of Comcast Corporation, where he was a driving force in its growth from a cable industry leader to one of the nation’s leading providers of entertainment, information and communication products and services.
Burke serves on the Boards of Directors of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase.[5] He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Personal life[edit]
Burke lives in New York with his wife and five children.[6]

Breaking: Steve Burke to become CEO of NBC Universal After Comcast Deal Closes

















By Chris Ariens on Sep. 26, 2010 - 2:33 PMComment

Stephen Burke will become chief executive officer of NBC Universal upon the close of Comcast’s acquisition of 51% of NBCU from GE, both companies announced today. The news comes two days after current NBCU CEO Jeff Zucker, a lifetime NBC employee, announced he would be stepping down once the deal closes.
Burke is COO of Comcast and is past president of Comcast Cable. But he has broadcast TV in his blood. He’s the son of  Daniel Burke, who along with Tom Murphy, ran Capital Cities Communications, an owner of several local TV stations. Cap Cities acquired ABC TV, a company 10 times its size, for $3.5 billion in 1985. Disney bought ABC 10 years later for $19 billion. Interestingly, Comcast made an unsuccessful $54 billion bid for Disney in 2004.
Says GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt about today’s news, “I have known  Steve Burke for many years and greatly respect him. He has deep  expertise in this industry and I am very confident that he will be a  strong leader for NBC Universal.”

COMCAST AND GE NAME STEVE BURKE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF
NBC UNIVERSAL
PHILADELPHIA, PA and FAIRFIELD, CT – SEPTEMBER 26, 2010 – Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA, CMCSK) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) announced today that Stephen B. Burke will become chief executive officer of NBC Universal (NBCU) upon the close of Comcast’s acquisition of 51% of NBCU from GE.
Burke, 52, would succeed NBC Universal President and CEO Jeff Zucker, who will continue to serve in his position until the close of the transaction and will work with Mr. Burke to ensure a smooth leadership transition.  Comcast and GE also said that there will be no additional structural or personnel announcements until the deal closing process and timing is certain.
Comcast Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian L. Roberts said, “Steve Burke is an experienced, talented and visionary leader with over 25 years in the media and entertainment industry.  Steve is one of the most well-respected executives in the industry, and I am confident that he will lead NBCU forward to a new era of growth.”
GE Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said, “I have known Steve Burke for many years and greatly respect him. He has deep expertise in this industry and I am very confident that he will be a strong leader for NBC Universal.”

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
