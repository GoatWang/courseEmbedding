Alumni SpotlightsPamela L. Carter, J.D., `84President, Cummins Distribution Business (Retired), Former Indiana Attorney GeneralSee more alumni spotlights »Pamela L. Carter entered the record books when she became the first African American state attorney general in United States history in 1993, as well as the first female attorney general for the state of Indiana. She remembers her days at the Indiana Attorney General’s office with enthusiasm. “We had a fabulous office. We won more U.S. Supreme Court cases and more Best Brief Awards than any other attorney general’s office in the nation,” she says. Her 15-year career as a social worker, along with her law degree, helped her land her first job in the public sector, which was as Deputy Chief of Staff and Executive Assistant for Health Policy and Human Services for then-Indiana Governor Evan Bayh.

 After her work in the public sector, she turned her talents to international business and held a number of positions in this country and abroad including President of Cummins Distribution Business.  She retired from Cummins in 2015 after 18 years with the company.
