Our Services
There are many health conditions that require care in settings outside of the traditional hospital. These range from very serious situations, such as stroke recovery or rehabilitation after a surgery like a hip replacement, to important, but less critical issues such as medication management. Most of these situations require medical expertise, but not traditional hospital level of care where the main priority is to stabilize your condition.
When you are able to leave the traditional hospital, you may need continued medical care or an extended recovery period. This is when you would transition to another care setting with varying medical intensity based on your needs.

Types of settings include:

Transitional Care Hospitals 
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers
Home Care
Hospice
Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals
Subacute Units
Assisted Living
In-Home Physician Care
Contract Rehabilitation Services

When I first walked into Kindred I felt a sense of healing. I am very fortunate to have come to a world-class facility with world-class staff. I love how everyone here makes you feel like family.
-William C., Kindred Rehabilitation Hospital patient


Everyone is exceptional at what they do here. They go above and beyond  for their patients.
-Margaret W., patient at Kindred Hospital


The care you gave my son was incredible. He was treated so well here and we will miss you all. Thank you for getting him better.
-Mother of Kindred Hospital patient


On behalf of my family, from the bottom of our hearts I would like to thank all the staff for looking after my mother. She means the whole world to us. Thank you for everything.
-Do N., child of Kindred Hospital patient


The therapy at home was very different than the therapy in a hospital because it was really one on one. They were just very conscientious about what they did so I was pleased with that... They took very good care of me. I did improve dramatically.
-Shirley, Kindred at Home patient


Before the surgery, someone called and said they would be taking care of me. They also came to my home to check out my house and make sure everything was safe and that I had all of the equipment needed…I continued to improve and get better..I would recommend it to anyone. It’s the best care I have ever had. They do a wonderful job.
-Gloria, Kindred at Home patient


One thing I liked was when I was over with my therapy; they called me [to ask how I was doing]. They called me quite a few times. They didn’t just do my therapy and say okay we are done with you.
-Les, Kindred at Home patient


There were a lot of things they didn’t have to do but they did it on their own. They didn’t hesitate to give me anything I needed.
-James, Kindred at Home patient


They have been such a support system and I really count on them. They give me a sense of security that I would not have without them there and they certainly have been there when we needed them.
-Eunice, wife of Kindred at Home patient

• Kindred Healthcare acquired Centerre Healthcare in January, 2015.  Centerre operations have been integrated into Kindred.

2013 and Earlier:
The IT department of Kindred Healthcare operates primarily from the company's corporate headquarters in Louisville, KY. The company's data center is also located in Louisville, KY.

The internal IT team is divided into several core groups: information systems, operations and telecommunications, finance and IS administration, and clinical and business systems. The department is carrying on an ongoing desktop virtualization initiative that will allow its users to access any application, anywhere, with any device. The department is also continuing to consolidate the infrastructure of acquired companies and migrate its systems and applications into its Microsoft-based private Cloud. The company relies on a variety of SAP-based solutions to support the business, including SAP ERP Financials, SAP ERP, and SAP BW. Hospitals use an in house electronic medical record (EMR) solution, called 'ProTouch'. The new iPad application from ProTouch was recently implemented, allowing doctors to access pertinent patient information from their registered mobile devices. 

In early 2013, Kindred introduced an officially BYOD policy. Per the policy, employees are required to register personal or company issued devices and install the MobileIron security application. At this time, the company's mobile platforms only support Apple iOS and android devices, due to MobileIron compatibility constraints. But, the company intends to explore other mobile technologies, such as the Windows 8 Phone as the program evolves.

IT Intelligence Snippets
2013 :
•1-5 pb data volume company-wide across 1 to 2 data centers, and expects an annual data growth of 6-10%.
•10-24% of its servers are to be virtualized by the end of 2013.
•Corporate IT manages 12000 mobile devices, while 5000 are managed elsewhere.
•Corporate IT manages 30000 desktops.
•Cost is the primary consideration for buying hardware, and it's standardized on 1-2 product vendors.
•Data center strategy is centered on minimizing cost.
•Long term plan for running new applications is to add servers and virtualize, but no new facilities are scheduled.

History[edit]
Kindred was founded in 1985 as Vencor, Inc. The current name was adopted on April 20, 2001 following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[9]
Divisions[edit]
Kindred operates four divisions: Transitional Care Hospitals, Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers, Care Management, and Kindred Rehabilitation Services. A former fifth division, Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), was spun off in a merger with AmerisourceBergen, resulting in the creation of PharMerica.[10]
Transitional Care Hospital[edit]
The Transitional Care Hospital division provides long-term acute care services to medically complex patients. Along with traditional freestanding hospitals, Kindred operates hospital-in-hospitals (HIH) that operate in a "host hospital" to provide long term acute care to patients it receives from the short-term acute care units.[11]
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers[edit]
The Nursing and Rehabilitation Division of Kindred Healthcare operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities. Kindred's centers care for both short- and long-term residents.
Care Management[edit]
A series of acquisitions from 2008 through 2011 led to the creation of a separate division for care management.[8]
The Care Management Division of Kindred Healthcare provides home health, hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings, including homes, skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings. The division includes Kindred at Home.[8] Care management services previously fell within the Home Health and Hospice division of Kindred Healthcare.[4]
Kindred Rehabilitation Services[edit]







Kindred's Rehabilitation division serves both Kindred and non-Kindred sites. Services are organized into two operating segments: skilled nursing rehabilitation services (SRS), which provide primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers; and hospital rehabilitation services (HRS), which provide inpatient program management and therapy services to hospital units and outpatient services to hospital based satellite programs.[11] In June 2011, Kindred combined its previous rehabilitation division with its new acquisition of RehabCare, renaming the division after this acquisition.[12]
In January 2016, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and its subsidiary RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay $125 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit on Medicare therapy claim overbilling. The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred. [13]

The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred.

History[edit]
Kindred was founded in 1985 as Vencor, Inc. The current name was adopted on April 20, 2001 following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[9]
Divisions[edit]
Kindred operates four divisions: Transitional Care Hospitals, Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers, Care Management, and Kindred Rehabilitation Services. A former fifth division, Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), was spun off in a merger with AmerisourceBergen, resulting in the creation of PharMerica.[10]
Transitional Care Hospital[edit]
The Transitional Care Hospital division provides long-term acute care services to medically complex patients. Along with traditional freestanding hospitals, Kindred operates hospital-in-hospitals (HIH) that operate in a "host hospital" to provide long term acute care to patients it receives from the short-term acute care units.[11]
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers[edit]
The Nursing and Rehabilitation Division of Kindred Healthcare operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities. Kindred's centers care for both short- and long-term residents.
Care Management[edit]
A series of acquisitions from 2008 through 2011 led to the creation of a separate division for care management.[8]
The Care Management Division of Kindred Healthcare provides home health, hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings, including homes, skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings. The division includes Kindred at Home.[8] Care management services previously fell within the Home Health and Hospice division of Kindred Healthcare.[4]
Kindred Rehabilitation Services[edit]







Kindred's Rehabilitation division serves both Kindred and non-Kindred sites. Services are organized into two operating segments: skilled nursing rehabilitation services (SRS), which provide primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers; and hospital rehabilitation services (HRS), which provide inpatient program management and therapy services to hospital units and outpatient services to hospital based satellite programs.[11] In June 2011, Kindred combined its previous rehabilitation division with its new acquisition of RehabCare, renaming the division after this acquisition.[12]
In January 2016, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and its subsidiary RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay $125 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit on Medicare therapy claim overbilling. The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred.

When I first walked into Kindred I felt a sense of healing. I am very fortunate to have come to a world-class facility with world-class staff. I love how everyone here makes you feel like family.
-William C., Kindred Rehabilitation Hospital patient


Everyone is exceptional at what they do here. They go above and beyond  for their patients.
-Margaret W., patient at Kindred Hospital


The care you gave my son was incredible. He was treated so well here and we will miss you all. Thank you for getting him better.
-Mother of Kindred Hospital patient


On behalf of my family, from the bottom of our hearts I would like to thank all the staff for looking after my mother. She means the whole world to us. Thank you for everything.
-Do N., child of Kindred Hospital patient


The therapy at home was very different than the therapy in a hospital because it was really one on one. They were just very conscientious about what they did so I was pleased with that... They took very good care of me. I did improve dramatically.
-Shirley, Kindred at Home patient


Before the surgery, someone called and said they would be taking care of me. They also came to my home to check out my house and make sure everything was safe and that I had all of the equipment needed…I continued to improve and get better..I would recommend it to anyone. It’s the best care I have ever had. They do a wonderful job.
-Gloria, Kindred at Home patient


One thing I liked was when I was over with my therapy; they called me [to ask how I was doing]. They called me quite a few times. They didn’t just do my therapy and say okay we are done with you.
-Les, Kindred at Home patient


There were a lot of things they didn’t have to do but they did it on their own. They didn’t hesitate to give me anything I needed.
-James, Kindred at Home patient


They have been such a support system and I really count on them. They give me a sense of security that I would not have without them there and they certainly have been there when we needed them.
-Eunice, wife of Kindred at Home patient

History[edit]
Kindred was founded in 1985 as Vencor, Inc. The current name was adopted on April 20, 2001 following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[9]
Divisions[edit]
Kindred operates four divisions: Transitional Care Hospitals, Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers, Care Management, and Kindred Rehabilitation Services. A former fifth division, Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), was spun off in a merger with AmerisourceBergen, resulting in the creation of PharMerica.[10]
Transitional Care Hospital[edit]
The Transitional Care Hospital division provides long-term acute care services to medically complex patients. Along with traditional freestanding hospitals, Kindred operates hospital-in-hospitals (HIH) that operate in a "host hospital" to provide long term acute care to patients it receives from the short-term acute care units.[11]
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers[edit]
The Nursing and Rehabilitation Division of Kindred Healthcare operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities. Kindred's centers care for both short- and long-term residents.
Care Management[edit]
A series of acquisitions from 2008 through 2011 led to the creation of a separate division for care management.[8]
The Care Management Division of Kindred Healthcare provides home health, hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings, including homes, skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings. The division includes Kindred at Home.[8] Care management services previously fell within the Home Health and Hospice division of Kindred Healthcare.[4]
Kindred Rehabilitation Services[edit]







Kindred's Rehabilitation division serves both Kindred and non-Kindred sites. Services are organized into two operating segments: skilled nursing rehabilitation services (SRS), which provide primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers; and hospital rehabilitation services (HRS), which provide inpatient program management and therapy services to hospital units and outpatient services to hospital based satellite programs.[11] In June 2011, Kindred combined its previous rehabilitation division with its new acquisition of RehabCare, renaming the division after this acquisition.[12]
In January 2016, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and its subsidiary RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay $125 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit on Medicare therapy claim overbilling. The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred. [13]

-Shirley, Kindred at Home patient


Before the surgery, someone called and said they would be taking care of me. They also came to my home to check out my house and make sure everything was safe and that I had all of the equipment needed…I continued to improve and get better..I would recommend it to anyone. It’s the best care I have ever had. They do a wonderful job.
-Gloria, Kindred at Home patient


One thing I liked was when I was over with my therapy; they called me [to ask how I was doing]. They called me quite a few times. They didn’t just do my therapy and say okay we are done with you.
-Les, Kindred at Home patient


There were a lot of things they didn’t have to do but they did it on their own. They didn’t hesitate to give me anything I needed.
-James, Kindred at Home patient


They have been such a support system and I really count on them. They give me a sense of security that I would not have without them there and they certainly have been there when we needed them.
-Eunice, wife of Kindred at Home patient

History[edit]
Kindred was founded in 1985 as Vencor, Inc. The current name was adopted on April 20, 2001 following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[9]
Divisions[edit]
Kindred operates four divisions: Transitional Care Hospitals, Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers, Care Management, and Kindred Rehabilitation Services. A former fifth division, Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), was spun off in a merger with AmerisourceBergen, resulting in the creation of PharMerica.[10]
Transitional Care Hospital[edit]
The Transitional Care Hospital division provides long-term acute care services to medically complex patients. Along with traditional freestanding hospitals, Kindred operates hospital-in-hospitals (HIH) that operate in a "host hospital" to provide long term acute care to patients it receives from the short-term acute care units.[11]
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers[edit]
The Nursing and Rehabilitation Division of Kindred Healthcare operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities. Kindred's centers care for both short- and long-term residents.
Care Management[edit]
A series of acquisitions from 2008 through 2011 led to the creation of a separate division for care management.[8]
The Care Management Division of Kindred Healthcare provides home health, hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings, including homes, skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings. The division includes Kindred at Home.[8] Care management services previously fell within the Home Health and Hospice division of Kindred Healthcare.[4]
Kindred Rehabilitation Services[edit]







Kindred's Rehabilitation division serves both Kindred and non-Kindred sites. Services are organized into two operating segments: skilled nursing rehabilitation services (SRS), which provide primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers; and hospital rehabilitation services (HRS), which provide inpatient program management and therapy services to hospital units and outpatient services to hospital based satellite programs.[11] In June 2011, Kindred combined its previous rehabilitation division with its new acquisition of RehabCare, renaming the division after this acquisition.[12]
In January 2016, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and its subsidiary RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay $125 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit on Medicare therapy claim overbilling. The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred. [13]

History[edit]
Kindred was founded in 1985 as Vencor, Inc. The current name was adopted on April 20, 2001 following the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.[9]
Divisions[edit]
Kindred operates four divisions: Transitional Care Hospitals, Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers, Care Management, and Kindred Rehabilitation Services. A former fifth division, Kindred Pharmacy Services (KPS), was spun off in a merger with AmerisourceBergen, resulting in the creation of PharMerica.[10]
Transitional Care Hospital[edit]
The Transitional Care Hospital division provides long-term acute care services to medically complex patients. Along with traditional freestanding hospitals, Kindred operates hospital-in-hospitals (HIH) that operate in a "host hospital" to provide long term acute care to patients it receives from the short-term acute care units.[11]
Nursing and Rehabilitation Centers[edit]
The Nursing and Rehabilitation Division of Kindred Healthcare operates nursing and rehabilitation centers and assisted living facilities. Kindred's centers care for both short- and long-term residents.
Care Management[edit]
A series of acquisitions from 2008 through 2011 led to the creation of a separate division for care management.[8]
The Care Management Division of Kindred Healthcare provides home health, hospice and private duty services to patients in a variety of settings, including homes, skilled nursing facilities and other residential settings. The division includes Kindred at Home.[8] Care management services previously fell within the Home Health and Hospice division of Kindred Healthcare.[4]
Kindred Rehabilitation Services[edit]







Kindred's Rehabilitation division serves both Kindred and non-Kindred sites. Services are organized into two operating segments: skilled nursing rehabilitation services (SRS), which provide primarily to freestanding skilled nursing centers; and hospital rehabilitation services (HRS), which provide inpatient program management and therapy services to hospital units and outpatient services to hospital based satellite programs.[11] In June 2011, Kindred combined its previous rehabilitation division with its new acquisition of RehabCare, renaming the division after this acquisition.[12]
In January 2016, Kindred Healthcare Inc. and its subsidiary RehabCare Group Inc. agreed to pay $125 million to settle a whistleblower lawsuit on Medicare therapy claim overbilling. The settlement ended an investigation into claims brought against the companies by former RehabCare therapists in a 2011 lawsuit. The suit claimed RehabCare routinely scheduled skilled nursing facility residents for higher levels of therapy than needed, resulting in therapy services were not reasonable or necessary, or never occurred. [13]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
