Major advancesrelating to drill pipe specifically developed for use in areas with significant H2S content have been realized. Traditionally, sulfidestress cracking (SSC) of drill pipe was prevented by controlling the environment: maintaining a pH of water base drilling fluidsabove a certain level, use of H2S inhibitors, or drilling H2S bearing formations with oil base fluids. As the severity of sour drillingapplications has increased and because of the desire to safely realize the benefits of underbalanced drilling in sour environmentsthe need for drill stem materials resistant to SSC has accelerated.A major driving force behind the development of new drill pipe materials relates to sour fields in Canada. A committeeconsisting of operators, contractors and manufacturers was formed to develop two critical sour drill pipe Industry RecommendedPractice documents. This paper provides background information on the evolution of sour service drill pipe, discusses thespecifications that have been developed and reviews case histories where various generations of sour service drill pipe have beensuccessfully used.The specifications address material properties, NACE SSC testing requirements and methods and inspection guidelines. The casehistories review results obtained in sour wells located in CanadaAuthors: Glenn R. Brown, P.Eng., Michael Jellison, Karol Szklarz, Jim Breihan, Jim MostowayGame Changing Drilling Tubular Technologies2003 CADE/CAODC Drilling ConferenceOctober 2003The need to exploit reservoirs with significant hydrogen sulphide concentrations is increasing.  Controlling the drilling environment can be problematic or undesirable for economic and drilling efficiency related reasons. Sulphide Stress Cracking (SSC) of drill strings used in sour wells is being addressed with revolutionary metallurgical and manufacturing technology advancements.  The Canadian drilling industry has begun to accumulate considerable field experience with Industry Recommended Practices (IRP) critical sour service drill pipe. The significant increases in the quantity of sour service drill strings in use will be discussed.The paper provides an update on the field history and continuing development and manufacturing efforts relating to IRP critical sour service drill pipe. A summary of key differences between of SS-95 and SS-105 drill pipe tubes will be given along with typical mill certifications for each grade.Testing of advanced, critical sour service tool joints is ongoing. Efforts in this area are discussed in the paper, including physical and metallurgical methods of enhancing weld area SSC performance.Advancements in metallurgical and manufacturing technology have yielded the development and repeatable production of ultra-high strength drill pipe grades up to 1,034 MPa (150,000 psi) minimum yield strength. These grades provide longer reach and deeper well depths without jeopardizing valuable rig set back capacity.As the petroleum industry moves toward more severe drilling applications - deepwater, extended reach, high-angle, short-radius and ultra-deep wells - new drill string connection designs are required to safely and efficiently achieve the drilling objectives of these projects. This paper describes new rotary shoulder connections that provide improved strength combined with morestreamline dimensions for extreme drilling applications.Authors: Glenn R. Brown, P.Eng., Dan Belczewski, Jim Mostoway, Michael JellisonEnhanced Steel Alloys Outperform Typical Bottom Hole Assembly Chemistries in SourSociety of Petroleum EngineersJune 2007Many of today’s aggressive drilling programs require well construction through sour formations to reach remote reservoirs. This has exposed limitations of traditional steel chemistries used for bottom hole assembly (BHA) components. For many years, the industry has used traditionalAPI materials in environments with low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Higher temperature and low stress conditions in the deeper portion of the well have allowed for these BHA materials to operate adequately with few issues. However, the drive to drill inmore corrosive and sour environments has increased the need to develop materials more aptly suited for harsh sour service conditions.Authors: Glenn R.

AV® Peer Review Rating
Glenn Legge was born in Walnut Creek, California and obtained his undergraduate education at the University of Kent at Canterbury and the University of California at Santa Barbara, where he received a B.A. with honors in 1979.  He attended the University of Houston Law Center where he received his J.D. in 1983.  Glenn is licensed to practice law in Texas and California and is admitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, as well as the United States District Courts for the Southern, Eastern and Northern Districts of Texas. 
He focuses his practice in the areas of commercial litigation, including energy, marine, construction and insurance coverage matters, as well as regulatory investigations.  Glenn represents clients in the energy, marine, insurance and technology industries in state and federal courts.  He has tried numerous cases to verdict, has arbitrated commercial disputes through award and enforcement and has argued cases before Texas appellate courts in the 1st, 5th and 14th Districts, the Texas Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Representative Matters:

Litigation/Arbitration


Defended major energy operator in commercial dispute over commercial development of property.  Tried to verdict in Harris County District Court.  Plaintiff received no recovery from verdict and client awarded $2.0 million for counterclaims and attorneys’ fees and costs.  The matter was appealed and settled for a favorable amount.
Represented major energy operator in commercial arbitration against an international engineering contractor concerning construction defect in deepwater tension leg platform in the Gulf of Mexico that was discovered two weeks before scheduled first oil.  Arbitration panel issued an award for client and awarded discovery sanctions against opposing counsel.
Represented a major energy company in a coverage dispute with two domestic insurers arising out of a pipeline explosion.  The case settled for policy limits of $10 million.
Represented a multinational energy service and fluids company in an arbitration against an international chemical company arising out the termination of a long term production contract. The arbitration panel found in favor of the client, finding that client’s contract remained in place but failed to award damages for delay.
Represented a major energy development company in a lawsuit involving a $98 million commercial dispute involving allegations of fraudulent transfer of property rights.  The District Court granted summary judgment for the client, which was upheld in the First Court of Appeals.
Represented a major energy company in a coverage dispute with a domestic insurer involving a arising out of a construction defect in a refinery turnaround.  The case settled for policy limits.
Represented a major offshore service company in a charter dispute.  The client prevailed at trial in federal district court and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court.
Represented a major energy operator in commercial arbitration against an international engineering contractor concerning defects and damage to umbilical installed on tension leg platform in the Gulf of Mexico.  The dispute was settled after initial rulings by the arbitration panel.
Represented various London insurers subscribing to $100,000 million excess placement in a coverage dispute with Kiewit involving a $20 million bad faith claim arising out of project for the Dallas Area Rapid Transit.  The matter was appealed and the Texas Supreme Court ruled in favor of the insurers on a standard ISO CGL contracts exclusion despite the majority of jurisdictions in the U.S. providing a contrary interpretation. Numerous insurance coverage treatises have recognized the Texas Supreme Court’s opinion in Gilbert Tex. Constr. Co. v. Underwriters at Lloyd’s London as a significant opinion impacting liability insurance coverage in the United States.  The National Insurance Law Forum listed the Gilbert opinion as one of its “most influential opinions of 2010.”
Represented a major energy operator in a putative class action suit alleging violations of the RICO statute, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and common law negligence.  A motion to dismiss was filed on behalf of the client, which was later dismissed from the case.
Represented a major energy operator in a commercial arbitration involving delay damages and cost overruns arising out of the construction of a pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico.  The arbitration panel issued an award against the client but within the projected range of exposure. 
Represented various London insurers subscribing to a 2001 Welcar offshore construction policy in a bad faith dispute involving the placement of a platform jacket in the Gulf of Mexico.  The adverse judgment was appealed and Texas Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals holding in favor of no coverage and remanded the case to District Court to allow the insurers to pursue their counterclaim for fraud.  The matter settled for a substantial amount prior to trial. Houston Exploration Co. v. Wellington Underwriting Agencies, Ltd., 352 S.W.3d 462 (Tex. 2011) is the only opinion issued by a court in the U.S. interpreting a 2001 Welcar policy.
Represented a major energy operator in claims against a vessel owner that damaged an offshore production facility.  The client pursued delayed production claims despite the fact that the production facility was subsequently sold to a third party and obtained a substantial settlement prior to trial.
Represented a major chemical company in a construction dispute against a contractor arising out of defective design of the client’s office building.  The case was pending for trial in state District Court in Harris County, when the client settled for a substantial sum.
Represented an energy service company in suit against former executive who misappropriated confidential trade secrets and marketing information and then assisted the startup of a competing company backed by private equity investors.  Client obtained a temporary restraining order against former employee and case settled prior to trial for a substantial sum.
