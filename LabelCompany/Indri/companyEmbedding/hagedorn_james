Education and military[edit]
Hagedorn is a graduate of the Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program and holds a degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. He is co-chairman of the National Fund for the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington, D.C., an associate trustee of the North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, New York and chairman of the board for the Farms for City Kids Foundation, Inc. in Reading, Vermont. Hagedorn also served in the United States Air Force for seven years as a captain and an F-16 fighter pilot.[1]
Scotts Miracle-Gro[edit]
Hagedorn joined Scotts Miracle-Gro in 1995 as senior vice president of Consumer Gardens Group, when the company merged with Stern's Miracle-Gro Products, Inc. At Miracle-Gro, he had served as executive vice president and was a major architect of Miracle-Gro's success both in the US and in the UK. James is the son of Horace Hagedorn, founder of Miracle-Gro. Following the merger, Hagedorn was instrumental in the effective integration of the two businesses.
Hagedorn was named president and chief operating officer in April 2000, and chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer in January 2003. Prior to April 2000, he was in charge of the company's North American business.[2]
An avid pilot, Hagedorn clashed with the company board over his desire to continue flying. He eventually reached a compromise with the board, requiring him to fly with a company copilot for some flights.[3]
James Hagedorn Aviation Complex[edit]
Recently, Hagedorn was recognized by Embry-Riddle for the contributions he has made to his alma mater in an announcement that the Aviation Complex, upon completion, would bear his name. He participated in its groundbreaking March 27, 2008.[4]

About Horace Hagedorn
Horace Hagedorn, who applied Madison Avenue wizardry to the plant food named Miracle Gro and sold it to just about every one of the post war suburbanites who yearned for a green thumb, died in January 2005 at his home in Sands Point, NY.  He was eighty-nine.


Miracle-Gro, which produced the world’s biggest cabbage, cantaloupe and dahlia, soon became as familiar a site in the American backyard as the station wagon in the carport.  The gardening business is now estimated to exceed 35 billion in annual sales, and Miracle-Gro’s share of the home fertilizer market is estimated to be 85 percent.


Mr. Hagedorn orchestrated the growth of his product like the marketing genius that he was.  He hired a Norman Rockwell colleague to paint homey advertisements, and actor James Whitmore, whose gnarled face suggested a trustworthy farmer for television commercials.  The 100,000 dollar prize he offered for a tomato of world record size was conditional on the use of a “certain” plant food.


The green and yellow package he commissioned became so famous that other companies, including AT&T and Hyundai, used it in ads for their products.  Mr. Hagedorn charged them nothing as long as they spelled Miracle-Gro correctly.


“He was a huckster”  his son James said with cheerful affection.  “One of those, like, carnival salesmen.”


James  also said his father was a sophisticated, hard-driving businessman.  When the Scotts Company, the huge garden products concern, merged with Miracle-Gro in 1995, most news reports said Scotts was absorbing the smaller plant food company.  A year later, Horace Hagedorn told the Wall Street Journal that he had acquired Scotts by insisting on an all-stock transaction.


The deal left the Hagedorns the largest shareholders with 43 percent of the company and 3 of the 11 board seats.  Horace was vice chairman and James was president.  James is now also chairman and chief executive.


“The truth of the matter is Scotts didn’t buy Miracle-Gro,” Horace said.  “The truth of the matter is, we bought Scotts.”


Tadd C. Seitz, the interim chief executive of Scotts at the time of the journal article, grudgingly acknowledged that the deal was far from a swallowing of Miracle-Gro.  “More than perhaps people perceived in the beginning,” he said.


Mr. Hagedorn, a multimillionaire, drove a Gremlin for many years and said he owned three suits and two pairs of shoes.  He gave tens of millions to children’s charities, and got special attention when he supported the education of 50 poor Brooklyn schoolchildren, with the goal of sending them to college.  About 85 percent are going to college, and Mr. Hagedorn recently offered a sixth-grade class in Columbus, Ohio the same deal.


Horace Hagedorn was born on March 18th, 1915 in Manhattan, where his father was a Real Estate speculator.  He earned a business degree from the University of Pennsylvania and began his working career selling advertising time on the radio.  He then produced a radio drama, “The Big Story,” a crime drama series.


He moved on to a small Manhattan advertising agency around the time he had a conversation with Martin Small, the celebrated advertising man credited with inventing roll-on deodorant.   Mr. Hagedorn said Mr. Small told him in five words, how to make a million dollars: “Find a need and fill it.”


“I said Marvin, that’s six words,”  Mr. Hagedorn said in an interview with The Washington Post in 2002, “And he said, ‘So I lied a little.’”


One day in the mid-1940’s, Otto Stern, a German-born nurseryman from Geneva, NY walked in the door in person and asked to buy advertising time on the radio program “Rambling With Gambling” on WOR-AM in New York, one of the top shows there for many years.  Mr. Stern hated to use the telephone because his thick accent made it difficult for people to understand him.


Mr. Stern sold plants and trees by mail and they were arriving in pretty bad shape.  Both he and Mr. Hagedorn hit upon the idea of fertilizer, and happened to read about the work of a Rutgers University professor, O. Wesley Davidson, an expert in raising Orchids.  They hired him as a technical consultant to develop a water-soluble fertilizer.


The ingredients were not entirely mysterious, because sellers of fertilizers are required to list the percentages of nitrogen, phosphorus, potash and other trace elements.  But the dry product, easy to ship and store, is mixed with water and the wetting agents and other ingredients are secrets.


“We were in the right place at the right time.”  Mr. Hagedorn said in an interview with The New York Times in 1993.  He cited the rise in home building after World War II and a consequent demand for garden products.  Also, Mr. Stern’s mail order nursery business also had many eager customers.


Mr. Hagedorn’s wife Peggy came up with the name Miracle-Gro, and the company was founded in 1950.  The next year, Mr. Stern and Mr. Hagedorn each put in $2000 to buy a full page advertisement in The New York Herald.  The ad Mr. Hagedorn wrote was sprinkled with scientific phrases about things like radioactive isotopes and promised luxuriant plant growth.  Within three days they had made ten times what the ad cost.


After four years, Miracle-gro’s sales had passed $500,000 annually, and Mr. Hagedorn decided to leave a successful advertising career to work full-time on Miracle-Gro. He bought out Mr. Stern in the mid 1980’s, a couple of years before he died.


Mr. Hagedorn’s strategy was to advertise on television, sell through the emerging new hardware store chains, and find a better way to apply the product then the original way of mixing a tablespoon of green granules with a gallon of water.  His employees came up with a device to dispense the fertilizer through a garden hose.


Mr. Hagedorn did not veer from his own expertise, doing marketing and sales for Miracle-Gro and farming out manufacturing, packaging and distribution to smaller companies.  He thus created what might be one of the first “Virtual Companies,”  that is, companies that exist to be successful brands, his son said.


When Mr. Hagedorn merged with Scotts, he had already given much of his stock to his children.  He took the $50 million he personally earned from the sale to set up a charitable trust.  Among many gifts, most to children’s causes, were contributions to Hofstra University’s School of Education, which is now named for him, and to Adelphi University’s business school, which also carries his name.


A little more than a year after his wife Peggy died in 1984, Mr. Hagedorn was looking at the personal ads in a local paper when he came across one placed by a woman who liked to read seed catalogs and sales, his other passion.  He answered on Miracle-gro stationary, and he and Amelia Maiello, a pre-kindergarten teacher, were later married.


She survives him along with his sons James, Peter, Robert, and Paul; and his daughters, Susan and Kate; 22 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.


For all his success elsewhere and no matter how much Miracle-Gro he lavished, Mr. Hagedorn could never grow a tomato in his own garden that weighed more than three pounds.  The world record is 7 pounds, 12 ounces.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.
