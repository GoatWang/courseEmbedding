Iridian is    an independently owned, value-oriented equity manager serving institutional investors. We employ a rigorous investment process that identifies opportunities and uncovers value across the market-capitalization spectrum.


THE COMPANY
Iridian Asset Management LLC is an independently owned, value-oriented investment management firm focused  on active equity investment strategies  for institutional investors, including foundations and endowments, corporate and public pension funds, sub-advised and Taft Hartley funds. As of March 31, 2017, assets under management totaled $13.9 billion in in  U.S. mid-cap and alternative strategies.   
Iridian was founded in 1996 by David Cohen and Harold Levy, two seasoned investment professionals who have worked side-by-side in the investment industry for over 20 years. Our unique "private business value" approach to investing, which drives our mid-cap and large-cap strategies, has its roots in their early investment careers, which encompassed direct experience in private equity, venture capital, distressed debt and bankruptcy takeovers. In analyzing investment opportunities, our founders learned the importance of focusing on cash-related metrics and in-depth, critical assessment of a company's management — two key factors that have been fundamental in shaping a shared and distinctive investment philosophy.        
Today, Iridian is built around a collaborative team of experienced investment professionals managing a range of traditional investment strategies for institutional investors.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.

Iridian is    an independently owned, value-oriented equity manager serving institutional investors. We employ a rigorous investment process that identifies opportunities and uncovers value across the market-capitalization spectrum.


THE COMPANY
Iridian Asset Management LLC is an independently owned, value-oriented investment management firm focused  on active equity investment strategies  for institutional investors, including foundations and endowments, corporate and public pension funds, sub-advised and Taft Hartley funds. As of March 31, 2017, assets under management totaled $13.9 billion in in  U.S. mid-cap and alternative strategies.   
Iridian was founded in 1996 by David Cohen and Harold Levy, two seasoned investment professionals who have worked side-by-side in the investment industry for over 20 years. Our unique "private business value" approach to investing, which drives our mid-cap and large-cap strategies, has its roots in their early investment careers, which encompassed direct experience in private equity, venture capital, distressed debt and bankruptcy takeovers. In analyzing investment opportunities, our founders learned the importance of focusing on cash-related metrics and in-depth, critical assessment of a company's management — two key factors that have been fundamental in shaping a shared and distinctive investment philosophy.        
Today, Iridian is built around a collaborative team of experienced investment professionals managing a range of traditional investment strategies for institutional investors.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for IDI (NYSE:IDI) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
