This regiment was organized in the fall of 1861 and was on service within the state until it was reorganized in Feb. 1864. The officers under the reorganization were as follows: Col., Nelson Cole; Lieut.- Col., G. W. Schofield, Majs., Frank Backof, C. Landgraeber, John W. Robb, Gustave Stange, John J. Sutter. In June, 1864, it was equipped and mounted as a regiment of light artillery, and the different batteries were soon afterward scattered over the country. Battery A was at Cape Girardeau until June 11, when it was ordered to St. Louis and remained there until October, when it took part in Price's raid, after which it was attached to the 1st division 16th corps, and with Gen. A. J. Smith proceeded to Nashville, where it assisted in the defeat and pursuit of Gen. Hood's army. Battery B acted as garrison at New Madrid until the latter part of April, when it was ordered to Springfield, Mo. In June it was moved to Rolla, thence to St. Louis, and participated in the pursuit of Price. It went into winter quarters at Franklin on Nov. 21, 1864. Battery C left Cape Girardeau on May 8 and went to St. Louis, where it received new equipments and from that time until the close of the year was on duty in various parts of the state. It also participated in the work of driving Price from Missouri. Battery D spent the year in the vicinity of Rolla, Pilot Knob, Batesville, Ark., Jacksonport and Devall's Bluff, and was engaged with the Confederates under Gen. Jo. Shelby at several points. Battery E was stationed at Little Rock, and formed part of the forces of Gen. Steele's Camden expedition. Battery F was assigned to the 1st division, 15th corps, about May 1, and remained with that command during the Atlanta campaign, being in the engagements at Resaca, Kennesaw Mountain, Dallas, and about Atlanta. In October it marched back to Resaca, engaging the enemy at several points on the way, and was later ordered to Nashville, where it was attached to the artillery reserve. Battery G left Cape Girardeau in August and went to Memphis, Tenn., where it was attached to the 1st brigade and participated in the repulse and pursuit of the Confederates under Gen. Forrest. It was then with an expedition, up the Tennessee River, after which it returned to Memphis, where it remained for the rest of the year. Battery H was on duty in Missouri and was one of the artillery organizations that was engaged in the pursuit of Price. During the raid it consumed 1,700 rounds of ammunition, which shows that it was not idle. Battery I was on duty at Rolla, New Madrid, St. Louis and Franklin until in November, when it was ordered to Paducah, Ky., where it was attached to Gen. A. J. Smith's command and moved to Nashville, where it fought with the 16th corps in the defeat of Hood's army. Battery K was on duty all the year in Missouri and was not in any serious engagements with the enemy. Battery L remained about Sedalia and Warrensburg until Sept. 24, when it was ordered to Jefferson City, and participated on the campaign against Price. Battery M was stationed at Camp Gamble, near St. Louis, until Aug. 16, when it was ordered to Springfield, and remained on duty in that part of the state until Nov. 13, when it went into winter quarters at Franklin. During the year 1865, Batteries B, C, D, E, H, K, L and M formed part of the Powder River expedition against the Indians, which left Omaha, Neb. July 2. Batteries A, F and I were on duty at Johnsonville, Tenn., until ordered to St. Louis for muster out in the latter part of August. The several batteries were mustered out at different times and places, M being the last to be discharged at St. Louis, Dec. 20, 1865. Source: The Union Army, vol. 4, p. 280
			UNCLE BILLY LEDGERWOOD, BARRY COUNTY'S LAST OLD INDIAN FIGHTER CELEBRATES 88TH BIRTHDAY ANNIVERSARY SHELL KNOB MAN IS ONE OF THE COUNTY'S OLD TIME AND HONORABLE CITIZENS (Contributed by W.T. Sallee) William Ledgerwood, the subject of this story, and those photograph appears herewith, was born in Martin County, Indiana, July 13th, 1844. He left Indiana at the age of seven years, and came with his parents to Barry County, Missouri, and settled on Capps Creek near Peirce City, and in about a year moved to Flat Creek near Cassville. He moved with his parents to Benton County, Arkansas, in 1854, where they lived until the year 1861, they then moved to Shell Knob, his present home. When the Civil War broke out he enlisted in the Army for the western Indian service under Gen. Cole, and was sent west with the 2nd Missouri Artillery, and remained in that service until 1867. He was engaged in a number of important battles with the red skins. He can tell many interesting stories concerning his Indian fighting in Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. After the war he returned to Shell Knob and was married to Miss Matilda Moles, sister of the late Weep Moles, well known citizen of the White River country in and early day. To this union were born eight children, two of whom died in infancy, and the rest of them lived to be men and women are Mrs. Barbara Brock, Mrs. Sara Whisman, Mrs. Mary Alexander, Mrs. Minnie Henbest and Sam and Grover Ledgerwood. He has thirty-three grandchildren, sixty-seven great-grandchildren and four great-great-grandchildren, a total number of 104 grandchildren. Most all of his children and grandchildren gathered at the old Legerwood home in Shell Knob on Wednesday, July 13th and celebrated the birthday of this good old pioneer, by spreading a sumptuous dinner in honor of the occasion of his 88th birthday. Uncle Billy spent most of the afternoon entertaining the young people by telling them stories of Indian fighting in the West and also of the early history of Barry county. we hope he may enjoy many more such accasions. Uncle Billy united with the Christian Church in 1868, and is still a faithful member of church, and is an old time Jackson Democrat. Mr.. Ledgerwood has a splendid memory for a man of his age. He still owns and occupies the old homestead formerly owned by his father. His good wife passed away a number of years ago, and since that time his son, Grover and family have lived with him. He enjoys telling of the pioneer days in Barry County when the country was thinly settled and farmers cultivated their crops with oxen. He tells the writer of this article that when he came to Shell Knob wild turkeys were more plentiful than quail now are. Bears were also plentiful at that time. He said he would go to get at night and to to sleep listening to the howl of he wolves and cream of panthers and at the first break of day in the spring-time he could hear the gobble of wild turkeys in every direction. He stated that it was not uncommon to see 25 to 30 deer in a drove. Very few of the old time citizens like Uncle Billy Ledgerwood are now living to tell us the interesting stories of pioneer days in Barry county. We should take off out hats to these old pioneers who underwent the hardships of such live and made this county what it is today. Shell Knob is situated on a splendid new state highway which is just being completed and the writer drove over this splendid highway from Cassville to Shell Knob, a distance of 20 miles in and automobile, in a few minutes, over practically the same ground that Uncle Billy Ledgerwood drove his ox wagon in a early day taking three days to make the trip both ways. Let us not in the mad rush of today forget to take a few hours' time to visit with such men as Uncle Billy and cheer them along the way and thus show them our appreciation of the great service they have rendered us.
