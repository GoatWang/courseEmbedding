Handing



X
											This is the usable orientation of the handle set or doorknob based on the hand commonly used to open the door. The easiest way to determine handing is to stand looking at your door from the outside of the room, if the hinges are on the right, you need a right handed set, if the hinges are on the left, you need a left handed set.

											This is the usable orientation of the handle set or doorknob based on the hand commonly used to open the door. The easiest way to determine handing is to stand looking at your door from the outside of the room, if the hinges are on the right, you need a right handed set, if the hinges are on the left, you need a left handed set.
