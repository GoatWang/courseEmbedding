It was clear that the House of Hughes was producing some of the best magic around.  I was able to buy a few of his items, but for the most part his effects were too expensive for my pocket.Thirty years on, it is a wonderful pleasure to look through these impressive volumes to relive so much of Jack’s magic.  These books are beautifully produced and give very detailed instructions on how to build nearly all of the House of Hughes magic.I was even lucky enough to get a signed copy of the first volume.Simply beautiful!

History[edit]
Jack Croco first started in the grocery business in Boise, Idaho, in the 1940s working for Albertsons Supermarkets. By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson's stores in the Seattle area. Soon afterward in 1955, he opened his own grocery store in Bellevue which was called Lake Hills Thriftway. The grocery concern that would come to be named QFC in 1963[1] was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way Northeast[1] by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell's Fine Candies. Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960. He remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65,[2] though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins & Co.[3] Sloan Adkins took QFC public in 1987.[1] Christopher A. Sinclair became the CEO in 1996. In 1997, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Fred Meyer,[1] and a year and a half later in May 1999 Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and QFC.[4] The Roosevelt store remained open through May 5, 2012, when it was closed to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[5]
Expansion[edit]
Over the years, QFC has expanded aggressively through acquisitions. When A&P Supermarkets abandoned the Seattle area in 1974, QFC took over several locations. They expanded to surrounding counties in the 1990s by acquiring and renaming Olson's Food Stores, Johnny's Food Centers, and Stock Market Grocery Stores as well as several Thriftway stores. Between 1990 and 1996, 30 stores were acquired from 11 different independent grocery chains.[6] Reed's Super Valu in Port Hadlock and Stock Market Foods in Port Townsend were acquired in 1997.[7][8] The company expanded into the Portland, Oregon, area as well.[9]
In the mid-1990s, QFC expanded to Southern California by acquiring Hughes Family Markets (which kept its name). By the mid-1990s, many Hughes store locations were sold to Ralphs, which soon was sold to Fred Meyer, before going to Kroger.[10]
Philanthropy and controversy[edit]
In 1996, Stuart Sloan, former owner and chairman of QFC, promised to spend at least $1 million a year for the next eight years to overhaul one of Seattle Public Schools's most challenged schools, T.T. Minor Elementary. The funds were donated in addition to public dollars and helped to pay for uniforms, smaller class sizes and a year-round schedule, though the manner in which the funds were applied sparked controversy.[11][12]
Advertising[edit]
In the 1960s, QFC ran a memorable animated ad which made use of produce puns, such as "raise our celery".[citation needed]
Positioning[edit]
QFC and Safeway are the dominant supermarkets in the city of Seattle and its surrounding suburbs. QFC is positioned as a smaller upscale supermarket relative to Fred Meyer, although both are owned by Kroger. QFC uses a preferred customer card to track customers and offer discounts.[citation needed]
Popular culture[edit]
Two QFC Stores in Seattle, Washington, were used for taping of the TLC Show Take Home Chef, starring Curtis Stone.[citation needed]
Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest references QFC in his song "I Want You To KnowThat I'm Awake/I Hope You're Asleep"

History[edit]
Jack Croco first started in the grocery business in Boise, Idaho, in the 1940s working for Albertsons Supermarkets. By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson's stores in the Seattle area. Soon afterward in 1955, he opened his own grocery store in Bellevue which was called Lake Hills Thriftway. The grocery concern that would come to be named QFC in 1963[1] was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way Northeast[1] by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell's Fine Candies. Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960. He remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65,[2] though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins & Co.[3] Sloan Adkins took QFC public in 1987.[1] Christopher A. Sinclair became the CEO in 1996. In 1997, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Fred Meyer,[1] and a year and a half later in May 1999 Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and QFC.[4] The Roosevelt store remained open through May 5, 2012, when it was closed to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[5]
Expansion[edit]
Over the years, QFC has expanded aggressively through acquisitions. When A&P Supermarkets abandoned the Seattle area in 1974, QFC took over several locations. They expanded to surrounding counties in the 1990s by acquiring and renaming Olson's Food Stores, Johnny's Food Centers, and Stock Market Grocery Stores as well as several Thriftway stores. Between 1990 and 1996, 30 stores were acquired from 11 different independent grocery chains.[6] Reed's Super Valu in Port Hadlock and Stock Market Foods in Port Townsend were acquired in 1997.[7][8] The company expanded into the Portland, Oregon, area as well.[9]
In the mid-1990s, QFC expanded to Southern California by acquiring Hughes Family Markets (which kept its name). By the mid-1990s, many Hughes store locations were sold to Ralphs, which soon was sold to Fred Meyer, before going to Kroger.[10]

Minor Elementary. The funds were donated in addition to public dollars and helped to pay for uniforms, smaller class sizes and a year-round schedule, though the manner in which the funds were applied sparked controversy.[11][12]
Advertising[edit]
In the 1960s, QFC ran a memorable animated ad which made use of produce puns, such as "raise our celery".[citation needed]

QFC and Safeway are the dominant supermarkets in the city of Seattle and its surrounding suburbs. QFC is positioned as a smaller upscale supermarket relative to Fred Meyer, although both are owned by Kroger. QFC uses a preferred customer card to track customers and offer discounts.[citation needed]

Sinclair became the CEO in 1996. In 1997, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Fred Meyer,[1] and a year and a half later in May 1999 Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and QFC.[4] The Roosevelt store remained open through May 5, 2012, when it was closed to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[5]
Expansion[edit]
Over the years, QFC has expanded aggressively through acquisitions. When A&P Supermarkets abandoned the Seattle area in 1974, QFC took over several locations. They expanded to surrounding counties in the 1990s by acquiring and renaming Olson's Food Stores, Johnny's Food Centers, and Stock Market Grocery Stores as well as several Thriftway stores. Between 1990 and 1996, 30 stores were acquired from 11 different independent grocery chains.[6] Reed's Super Valu in Port Hadlock and Stock Market Foods in Port Townsend were acquired in 1997.[7][8] The company expanded into the Portland, Oregon, area as well.[9]
In the mid-1990s, QFC expanded to Southern California by acquiring Hughes Family Markets (which kept its name). By the mid-1990s, many Hughes store locations were sold to Ralphs, which soon was sold to Fred Meyer, before going to Kroger.[10]
Philanthropy and controversy[edit]
In 1996, Stuart Sloan, former owner and chairman of QFC, promised to spend at least $1 million a year for the next eight years to overhaul one of Seattle Public Schools's most challenged schools, T.T. Minor Elementary. The funds were donated in addition to public dollars and helped to pay for uniforms, smaller class sizes and a year-round schedule, though the manner in which the funds were applied sparked controversy.[11][12]
Advertising[edit]
In the 1960s, QFC ran a memorable animated ad which made use of produce puns, such as "raise our celery".[citation needed]
Positioning[edit]
QFC and Safeway are the dominant supermarkets in the city of Seattle and its surrounding suburbs. QFC is positioned as a smaller upscale supermarket relative to Fred Meyer, although both are owned by Kroger. QFC uses a preferred customer card to track customers and offer discounts.[citation needed]
Popular culture[edit]
Two QFC Stores in Seattle, Washington, were used for taping of the TLC Show Take Home Chef, starring Curtis Stone.[citation needed]
Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest references QFC in his song "I Want You To KnowThat I'm Awake/I Hope You're Asleep"

History[edit]
Jack Croco first started in the grocery business in Boise, Idaho, in the 1940s working for Albertsons Supermarkets. By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson's stores in the Seattle area. Soon afterward in 1955, he opened his own grocery store in Bellevue which was called Lake Hills Thriftway. The grocery concern that would come to be named QFC in 1963[1] was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way Northeast[1] by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell's Fine Candies. Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960. He remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65,[2] though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins & Co.[3] Sloan Adkins took QFC public in 1987.[1] Christopher A. Sinclair became the CEO in 1996. In 1997, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Fred Meyer,[1] and a year and a half later in May 1999 Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and QFC.[4] The Roosevelt store remained open through May 5, 2012, when it was closed to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[5]

By 1950, he had become the district manager in the Northwest and was responsible for opening the first Albertson's stores in the Seattle area. Soon afterward in 1955, he opened his own grocery store in Bellevue which was called Lake Hills Thriftway. The grocery concern that would come to be named QFC in 1963[1] was founded in 1955 with the first store at 6600 Roosevelt Way Northeast[1] by a group headed by Vern Fortin, the former president of Van de Kamp's Holland Dutch Bakeries and founder of Vernell's Fine Candies. Croco merged his store with QFC in 1960. He remained involved in the company until his death in 1991 at the age of 65,[2] though in 1986 he sold QFC to Seattle investment firm Sloan, Adkins & Co.[3] Sloan Adkins took QFC public in 1987.[1] Christopher A. Sinclair became the CEO in 1996. In 1997, QFC purchased the Uddenberg grocery company which operated Thriftway and Stock Market stores throughout western Washington. In late 1997, QFC was sold to Fred Meyer,[1] and a year and a half later in May 1999 Kroger acquired Fred Meyer and QFC.[4] The Roosevelt store remained open through May 5, 2012, when it was closed to make way for construction of the Roosevelt light rail station.[5]
Expansion[edit]
Over the years, QFC has expanded aggressively through acquisitions. When A&P Supermarkets abandoned the Seattle area in 1974, QFC took over several locations. They expanded to surrounding counties in the 1990s by acquiring and renaming Olson's Food Stores, Johnny's Food Centers, and Stock Market Grocery Stores as well as several Thriftway stores. Between 1990 and 1996, 30 stores were acquired from 11 different independent grocery chains.[6] Reed's Super Valu in Port Hadlock and Stock Market Foods in Port Townsend were acquired in 1997.[7][8] The company expanded into the Portland, Oregon, area as well.[9]
In the mid-1990s, QFC expanded to Southern California by acquiring Hughes Family Markets (which kept its name). By the mid-1990s, many Hughes store locations were sold to Ralphs, which soon was sold to Fred Meyer, before going to Kroger.[10]
Philanthropy and controversy[edit]
In 1996, Stuart Sloan, former owner and chairman of QFC, promised to spend at least $1 million a year for the next eight years to overhaul one of Seattle Public Schools's most challenged schools, T.T. Minor Elementary. The funds were donated in addition to public dollars and helped to pay for uniforms, smaller class sizes and a year-round schedule, though the manner in which the funds were applied sparked controversy.[11][12]
Advertising[edit]
In the 1960s, QFC ran a memorable animated ad which made use of produce puns, such as "raise our celery".[citation needed]
Positioning[edit]
QFC and Safeway are the dominant supermarkets in the city of Seattle and its surrounding suburbs. QFC is positioned as a smaller upscale supermarket relative to Fred Meyer, although both are owned by Kroger. QFC uses a preferred customer card to track customers and offer discounts.[citation needed]
Popular culture[edit]
Two QFC Stores in Seattle, Washington, were used for taping of the TLC Show Take Home Chef, starring Curtis Stone.[citation needed]
Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest references QFC in his song "I Want You To KnowThat I'm Awake/I Hope You're Asleep"

Greetings from Park City and Hughes Martin!As the snow slowing recedes from the mountains I thought I would give you all an update on a part of the Park City spring that is dear to my heart!For kids, the opportunity to grow up here in Park City means skiing, everyone starts out skiing! But with the coming of spring, skiing ends and for Park City High School the soccer season takes hold. Many of you that know me know my son Tommy loves soccer.You might not know though he is on the Real Salt Lake Farm Team (the local MLS soccer team) and has a 4 year scholarship to college, to a feeder school to the MLS. Soccer is something we really focus on here in the Martin family. Check out this Desert News Article, Tommy and the rest of the Park City team will be playing this Friday in the State semi finals! (and yes I am proud)Park City's summer and spring recreation is just as much a part of the Park City Lifestyle as skiing is in the winter. Fly fishing, hiking, mountain biking and music all make the summers in Park City - the reason we stay!Check out the Recreation Page on my web site. It's easy to see how Park City, Deer Valley and the Canyons have grown into a first class four season vacation destination.  Imagine what it's like to live here! If you plan on visiting this summer, drop us a line - summer is also a great time to look at real estate! Or if you like feel free to use our new MLS Search to browse for properties 24/7. Feel free to call if you have any questions.Which reminds me - check out the Park City Board of Realtors new http://www.parkcityhousingfacts.com/ - I think you might find this interesting!

    As we near the end of the 1st quarter of 2008 I thought it would be a good time to reflect back on the recent past in Park City Real Estate.

Even though this winter has been such a spectacular event that Stien Erickson, on our local radio station's "Randy Barton Show" l...
