Brian Lipke plans to sell up to 15 percent of his Gibraltar Industries stock - The Buffalo News

Gibraltar Industries Chief Executive Brian J. Lipke plans to sell as much as 15 percent of his stock in the Hamburg-based construction products company his family has led for decades. Lipke plans to sell the shares this year under a trading plan that has been established for the trust that holds the executive’s shares in the company.
Lipke’s latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that he held 1.33 million Gibraltar shares, either directly or indirectly. If Lipke were to sell 15 percent of his total holdings, the sale would involve a little more than 199,000 shares.
Lipke is Gibraltar’s largest individual shareholder, controlling 4.3 percent of the company’s shares, and the seventh-biggest shareholder overall, trailing six mutual fund groups and investment firms. If he were to sell a full 15 percent of his total holdings, his stake in the company would drop to about 3.7 percent.
Lipke said he will not have any control over the timing of the sales, which will be made at prevailing market prices and will be subject to minimum price thresholds. 
Lipke said the stock sale is being done in connection with his personal estate planning and is related to a long-term asset diversification program. At Gibraltar’s current share price of $18.07 per share, the sale could raise almost $3.6 million for Lipke.

							Gibraltar Industries Announces Adoption of Pre-Arranged Trading Plan by Executive Chairman Brian J. Lipke

Categories





 

 


BUFFALO, N.Y.
      Gibraltar Industries (NASDAQ: ROCK) today announced that a trust that       holds shares of the Company’s common stock for the benefit of Brian J.       Lipke, the Company’s Executive Chairman, has entered into a pre-arranged       trading plan to sell a portion of those shares. The trading plan is       designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of       1934, as amended, and with the Company’s insider trading policy. Mr.       Lipke has authorized the entry into the trading plan in connection with       his personal estate planning and a related long-term asset       diversification program, which were developed in conjunction with his       previously announced intention to retire from his position as Executive       Chairman on June 1, 2015.    
      Under the trading plan, Mr. Lipke will have no control over the timing       of sales of the Company’s stock held by the trust and, subject to       minimum price thresholds, sales of the Company’s common stock will be       made at prevailing market prices by the broker designated to carry the       terms of the trading plan into effect. The trading plan permits the       trust to sell up to approximately 20% of the total number of shares of       the Company’s common stock owned directly and indirectly by Mr. Lipke.       The trading plan will expire March 15, 2016.    
About Gibraltar
