								Lyrics
							







 


							Gone for Good						



Hey babe why’d you look at me that way
I know these days have gotten so crazy
And sometimes it’s harder to see
That I won’t let you go now, if you come back to me
But I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
 
Analyze…take some time before you go
Mesmerized…oh you don’t even know
Terrorizing…the way we used to be
And I won’t let you go now, if you come back to me
Cause I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
 
Sleep alone.
I can’t sleep alone.
Sleep alone.
I can’t sleep alone.
Cause I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
Life was so good
When we were gone for good

							Afterglow						



She got a lock on California
but she dreams of Tennessee.
She got a rider right beside her
but she only thinks of me.
 
I'm a lot like California.
I'm the wind blowing through your hair.
And I'm a thousand miles behind ya
I just wish that I was there.
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
that you're my afterglow.
 
She said wow, how could you act that way.
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh, because you know it's true.
There's a lot of typical conversations that go,
"I only think of you."
Its three o'clock in the morning.
What's goin on in my head?
I spend a lot of time in my own mind and slurring
the things I shoulda said.
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
that you're my afterglow.
 
Afterglow.
Afterglow.
She's got that something
but I can't see nothing but a...
Afterglow.
Afterglow.
 
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
you already know,
you're my afterglow.

							In the Middle						



I think I may
I think I might
the future baby is infinite
and its all wrong, but its alright.
I got no luck.
I got no fear.
Just got no reason to stay here.
So click your heels and I'll disappear.
 
And I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
Maybe someday...
Maybe one way with all,
of this possibility...
maybe someday.
But people never change.
People just stay the same,
we're all just hung up on being strange.
Some people never change.
 
 
 
But I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
We're all hung up on being strange.
Typical and rearranged.
And it's good, but that's no fun.
 
 
And I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
Just stuck in the middle.

							Ditto Baby						



You come walking my way
believe me when I say
you got everything going on.
Theres too many reasons and seasons
and stupid people all believing they got
the right thing when its wrong.
 
So come on baby, don't say maybe...
 
Say I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok...
say ditto baby.
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok...
and ditto baby.
 
So look at what I found
in a small town
in a shit bar that's just too loud
but you know
its where to find me.
And we were the last ones
not leaving,
spinning records
and scheming.
If you go,
I'm thinkin maybe...
 
 
That I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok...
say ditto baby.
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok...
and ditto baby.
 
And I'm not sorry now.
And I'm not sorry now.
Ok?
Ditto baby.
 
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok
and ditto baby.
Cause I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok
say ditto baby.
 
Ditto baby.

							Cable						



Annie’s up the stairs in my bed,

I think I’ll wake her.

She don’t want no one, she wanna get drunk.

I think I’ll take her up.

 

And it’s all just a tic in my mind.

Just like yesterday.

And on and on. On and on and on and on and on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, just hold on.

Just hold on.

 

Annie bums a cigarette

Cause possibility hasn’t paid off yet.

She gets mad. I’m losing it.

Tell the moon it’s over, I’m just so sick of this shit.

 

And it’s all just a tic in my mind.

Just like yesterday.

And on and on. On and on and on and on and on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold on.

 

We come back to find that we can’t walk this line.

Hold on.

It’s a tic inside my mind, that says it’s all just a matter of time.

If we can just hold on.

Just hold on.

I tell myself just hold on.

Just hold on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, just hold on.

Just hold on.

I tell myself just hold on.

I’m telling you just hold on.

The Ark of Music



					The Ark 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Gone for Good, has just dropped, and quickly proves that the hype that has been generated around Hunter is well-earned. A throwback to the heavy-hearted, electric guitar-laden songs of love and loss that saturated the 90’s and early 2000’s, Gone for Good’s wise production and writing will feel very familiar to Generation X’ers, and will give the Millennials—and beyond—a lesson in real, blue-collar music, made with real musical instruments by real, blue-collar musicians. 


The Daily Vault



					Jason Warburg 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Robert Hunter has a pair of potent EPs under his belt, full of sharp tunes performed with skill, integrity and—most important of all—genuine commitment and passion. 


Music Blogged



					Ben Corke 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Robert’s refreshing brand of alt-rock is proudly displayed on ‘Afterglow’, with accomplished tracks including ‘Gone for Good’ and ‘Cable’ that offer a smart outlook on the trials and tribulations of life. 


Jamsphere



					Rick Jamm 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


“Afterglow” ticks most of the boxes for what makes good alt-rock these days: singable hooks, stompy riffs, soaring melodies, moody vocals and tons of edgy emotion. Besides being well-produced, the track list is nicely balanced, and Robert Hunter’s raspy vocals casts a magnetic spell over the music that has just enough rawness to it to make more interesting than your average mainstream rock, but catchy enough to cast an eye at the radio charts. 


Creative Control Magazine



					Lindsey McIntyre 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 06, 2017				


"As expected – I mean, the guy is also a poet – the lyrics are smart and strong." 


Music vs The World



					Fi Stimpson 
				
	
				  
		
				



““Outta My Mind” is successfully hard-wiring into my brain after a single listen.” 


Daily Vault



					Jason Warburg 
				
	
				  
		
				



“The number one point of comparison here, though, stems from the combination of the late-’90s radio-friendly alt-rock production (“A little more echo on the vocals… keep everything else clean and well-defined and spacious… yeah, that’s it”) with a voice that could pass for Rob Thomas’ younger brother. Once you hear it, you can’t un-hear it: this feels and sounds remarkably like alternate-universe early Matchbox 20. Outta My Mind showcases Robert Hunter’s gift for combining smart lyrics with smart hooks, delivering earnest and reliably well-crafted tunes that hark back to the golden age of radio-friendly alt-rock.”

								Lyrics
							







 


							Gone for Good						



Hey babe why’d you look at me that way
I know these days have gotten so crazy
And sometimes it’s harder to see
That I won’t let you go now, if you come back to me
But I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
 
Analyze…take some time before you go
Mesmerized…oh you don’t even know
Terrorizing…the way we used to be
And I won’t let you go now, if you come back to me
Cause I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
 
Sleep alone.
I can’t sleep alone.
Sleep alone.
I can’t sleep alone.
Cause I remember
 
We were gone and going faster
Into the dawn of a new disaster
Oh my God, life was so good
When we were gone for good
Life was so good
When we were gone for good

							Afterglow						



She got a lock on California
but she dreams of Tennessee.
She got a rider right beside her
but she only thinks of me.
 
I'm a lot like California.
I'm the wind blowing through your hair.
And I'm a thousand miles behind ya
I just wish that I was there.
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
that you're my afterglow.
 
She said wow, how could you act that way.
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh, because you know it's true.
There's a lot of typical conversations that go,
"I only think of you."
Its three o'clock in the morning.
What's goin on in my head?
I spend a lot of time in my own mind and slurring
the things I shoulda said.
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
that you're my afterglow.
 
Afterglow.
Afterglow.
She's got that something
but I can't see nothing but a...
Afterglow.
Afterglow.
 
 
Look to the sky under the sun.
Count every step as you go.
When you get so high, you don't need anyone.
But you already know,
you already know,
you're my afterglow.

							In the Middle						



I think I may
I think I might
the future baby is infinite
and its all wrong, but its alright.
I got no luck.
I got no fear.
Just got no reason to stay here.
So click your heels and I'll disappear.
 
And I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
Maybe someday...
Maybe one way with all,
of this possibility...
maybe someday.
But people never change.
People just stay the same,
we're all just hung up on being strange.
Some people never change.
 
 
 
But I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
We're all hung up on being strange.
Typical and rearranged.
And it's good, but that's no fun.
 
 
And I'm already gone,
not just stuck in the middle.
You know by now I can't keep goin.
I'm already torn apart,
not just a little.
You know by now I can't keep going
just stuck in the middle.
 
Just stuck in the middle.

							Ditto Baby						



You come walking my way
believe me when I say
you got everything going on.
Theres too many reasons and seasons
and stupid people all believing they got
the right thing when its wrong.
 
So come on baby, don't say maybe...
 
Say I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok...
say ditto baby.
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok...
and ditto baby.
 
So look at what I found
in a small town
in a shit bar that's just too loud
but you know
its where to find me.
And we were the last ones
not leaving,
spinning records
and scheming.
If you go,
I'm thinkin maybe...
 
 
That I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok...
say ditto baby.
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok...
and ditto baby.
 
And I'm not sorry now.
And I'm not sorry now.
Ok?
Ditto baby.
 
I won't be your valentine
just get me drunk on cheap red wine
she said ok
and ditto baby.
Cause I can't live without your love
I might be gone when you wake up
and if that's ok
say ditto baby.
 
Ditto baby.

							Cable						



Annie’s up the stairs in my bed,

I think I’ll wake her.

She don’t want no one, she wanna get drunk.

I think I’ll take her up.

 

And it’s all just a tic in my mind.

Just like yesterday.

And on and on. On and on and on and on and on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, just hold on.

Just hold on.

 

Annie bums a cigarette

Cause possibility hasn’t paid off yet.

She gets mad. I’m losing it.

Tell the moon it’s over, I’m just so sick of this shit.

 

And it’s all just a tic in my mind.

Just like yesterday.

And on and on. On and on and on and on and on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold on.

 

We come back to find that we can’t walk this line.

Hold on.

It’s a tic inside my mind, that says it’s all just a matter of time.

If we can just hold on.

Just hold on.

I tell myself just hold on.

Just hold on.

 

Cause I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, hold.

I’m a cable.

I’m alright if I can, just hold on.

Just hold on.

I tell myself just hold on.

I’m telling you just hold on.

The Ark of Music



					The Ark 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Gone for Good, has just dropped, and quickly proves that the hype that has been generated around Hunter is well-earned. A throwback to the heavy-hearted, electric guitar-laden songs of love and loss that saturated the 90’s and early 2000’s, Gone for Good’s wise production and writing will feel very familiar to Generation X’ers, and will give the Millennials—and beyond—a lesson in real, blue-collar music, made with real musical instruments by real, blue-collar musicians. 


The Daily Vault



					Jason Warburg 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Robert Hunter has a pair of potent EPs under his belt, full of sharp tunes performed with skill, integrity and—most important of all—genuine commitment and passion. 


Music Blogged



					Ben Corke 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


Robert’s refreshing brand of alt-rock is proudly displayed on ‘Afterglow’, with accomplished tracks including ‘Gone for Good’ and ‘Cable’ that offer a smart outlook on the trials and tribulations of life. 


Jamsphere



					Rick Jamm 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 10, 2017				


“Afterglow” ticks most of the boxes for what makes good alt-rock these days: singable hooks, stompy riffs, soaring melodies, moody vocals and tons of edgy emotion. Besides being well-produced, the track list is nicely balanced, and Robert Hunter’s raspy vocals casts a magnetic spell over the music that has just enough rawness to it to make more interesting than your average mainstream rock, but catchy enough to cast an eye at the radio charts. 


Creative Control Magazine



					Lindsey McIntyre 
				
	
				  
		
				
					February 06, 2017				


"As expected – I mean, the guy is also a poet – the lyrics are smart and strong." 


Music vs The World



					Fi Stimpson 
				
	
				  
		
				



““Outta My Mind” is successfully hard-wiring into my brain after a single listen.” 


Daily Vault



					Jason Warburg 
				
	
				  
		
				



“The number one point of comparison here, though, stems from the combination of the late-’90s radio-friendly alt-rock production (“A little more echo on the vocals… keep everything else clean and well-defined and spacious… yeah, that’s it”) with a voice that could pass for Rob Thomas’ younger brother. Once you hear it, you can’t un-hear it: this feels and sounds remarkably like alternate-universe early Matchbox 20. Outta My Mind showcases Robert Hunter’s gift for combining smart lyrics with smart hooks, delivering earnest and reliably well-crafted tunes that hark back to the golden age of radio-friendly alt-rock.”
