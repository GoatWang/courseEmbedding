Ethylene is the natural plant hormone generated internally, which governs the speed at which quality and freshness are lost.  Keeping produce fresh is especially important during storage and transport because ethylene-rich environments can trigger the ripening process too quickly, which results in spoilage, loss and waste.   At AgroFresh, we can look back on more than 15 years of investment in numerous scientific and commercial applications of 1-MCP, which temporarily blocks the production and absorption of ethylene.     Our company pioneered the first pre-commercial trials on apples, fine-tuned the product formulation and developed use recommendations and appropriate protocols adapted to each crop and each region. We have extensive knowledge of fresh produce quality management thanks to many years of close cooperation with international researchers, universities and customers.       Our customer portfolio offers more than the active ingredient for post-harvest application with is reliability and performance excellence.       Our customers gain from technical expertise acquired through our continually expanding international customer base, quality tracking studies and experience with all existing storage and transport regimes and marketing strategies. We continue to invest in R&D around the world. Commitment to customers is paramount, and we have offices and research facilities in many regions. Each customer relationship is approached with a solution-based, long term view.  AgroFresh's brands are only marketed for crops, where scientific experience has demonstrated clear benefits for our customers.                                      ® TM Trademark of AgroFresh. © AgroFresh, 2015.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Why AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. Stock Fell Nearly 50% on Q3 Results
Here are some reasons the agricultural products company had a very difficult quarter.











                Lee Samaha
            

                (TMFSaintGermain)



            
            Nov 10, 2016 at 10:34AM
            
            





AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGFS) CEO Jordi Ferre can be excused any apprehension before his first earnings call Wednesday as the head of the agricultural products company. The third-quarter results contained almost a full house of disappointments, from weaker-than-expected end markets to increased competitive pressures to failure to hit management's sales targets. Let's take a look at the results from a difficult quarter. 
AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. Q3 earnings: The raw numbers 
Starting with the headline figures from the quarter:

 Net sales declined 1% to $61.2 million.
 Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) dropped 10% to $40.2 million.

It was clearly a disappointing quarter, and management reduced its full-year outlook, too:

 Full-year guidance for sales in the range of $160 million to $165 million compared to previous guidance for $172 million to $184 million
 Full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of $77 million to $82 million compared to previous guidance for $90 million to $100 million

A quick look at the updated full-year outlook and it's not hard to see why the stock price slumped nearly 50% on the day of the results. 
What happened in AgroFresh's third quarter 
The better question is: What didn't happen in AgroFresh's third quarter? In short, the company was hit with three significant issues:

 Forecasts for U.S. apple harvest growth have been reduced to 3% from 11% previously, with the European crop still expected to decline by 3%.
 Increasing competition for its core SmartFresh product (which keeps fruit, primarily apples, fresh during storage and transportation) caused a sales shortfall as AgroFresh was forced to cut prices to try to maintain share.
 Sales of Harvista (which expands harvest windows and reduces fruit drop) fell short of expectations as 30,000 acres were treated in the first nine months compared to an estimate for 40,000 acres.

For reference, apples (primarily SmartFresh product) are responsible for around 84% of AgroFresh sales, and management plans to report "SmartFresh post-harvest sales into the global apple market" as its base business in the future. Harvista contributes 5% to 10% of sales. In other words, sales of SmartFresh to the Northern Hemisphere apple market are the key determinant of the company's current prospects. Unfortunately, this is the second year in a row in which the U.S. apple crop has disappointed, so it's hard to be too critical of AgroFresh.

APPLES MAKE UP AGROFRESH'S CORE MARKET. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.
Turning to the issue of increasing competition for SmartFresh, Ferre sounded an ominous note on the earnings call when he said, "We see competition obviously increasing today and in the future as well. But I think that what we need to do is be ... a lot more competitive in what we do." One of the responses was to cut pricing in order to preserve market share at above 90% of the market for treated apples in the U.S. Given that Ferre expects more competition in the future, it's reasonable to expect ongoing price pressure.
Harvista, despite missing management's forecast sales, still grew 50%. Ferre said that the shortfall from projections came from a particular variety of apples. Hopefully, management's experience this year will position it well to understand where it can better target sales growth.





Looking ahead
Investors will be hoping AgroFresh can expand sales of products other than SmartFresh in order to diversify its income stream and alleviate any overall pressure on sales coming from increasing competition for the flagship product. Meanwhile, preserving market share for SmartFresh is obviously a priority. In addition, it's worth noting that the last two U.S. apple crops have been disappointing, so all eyes are now turned toward the Southern Hemisphere crop in the spring.

AgroFresh Solutions Inc. Earnings Will Still Rely on Weather
The company hopes to expand its sales outside of apples, and its key SmartFresh product, by developing Ripelock and Harvista sales. 











                Lee Samaha
            

                (TMFSaintGermain)



            
            May 16, 2016 at 1:48PM
            
            





How 'bout them apples, and how 'bout that one product? At the moment those are the two key questions AgroFresh Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:AGFS) shareholders are asking themselves before considering the company's progress. The company remains heavily reliant on the global apple harvest and its core SmartFresh product, which keeps fruit fresh longer during storage and transportation, and that exposure has hurt the company in recent quarters. Its first-quarter 2016 results were disappointing, but management outlined steps to improve overall performance in the future. Let's take a closer look at what's going on. 
AgroFresh Solutions' first-quarter results: The key facts
Following a fourth quarter adversely affected by a weaker-than-expected Northern Hemisphere apple harvest, the first quarter was hit by adverse weather in the Southern Hemisphere. The result was a reduced apple crop size in the Southern Hemisphere, coupled with a delaying of the harvest in important agricultural countries such as Chile and New Zealand. 
As such, net sales were $28.4 million, down 13.4% compared with the same period last year. It represents a decline of $4.4 million, and management expects its first-half sales to decline $2.5 million to $5.5 million compared with last year's first half. 
The profit picture needs a little explaining. Gross profit of $4.6 million represents an eye-watering decline of $23.2 million from last year's first quarter, while the net income loss of $25.1 million compares unfavorably with the $2.5 million gain reported last year.
It all sounds terrible, but net income was affected by a number of factors, including extra costs associated with becoming a public company, increasing inventory to service growth, the timing of R&D expenditures, and certain nonrecurring expenses connected with "professional services as we transition to our own processes in internal staff."  
All told, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is a better way to look at the quarter. It declined from $18.4 million to $8.5 million on a year-on-year basis -- still a bad number, but nowhere near as bad as the reported net-income figures.

AGROFRESH SOLUTIONS INC HOPES TO EXPAND ITS SALES TO FRUITS SUCH AS BANANAS, PLUMS, AND PEARS. 
Growth strategy 
It wasn't a great result, but management highlighted some positives to look forward to. 

The company is maintaining full-year guidance of 5%-12% sales growth, and adjusted EBITDA of $90 million to $100 million.
The delayed harvests in certain countries will push some revenue into the second quarter.
Market share is "holding up nicely" in the Southern Hemisphere, with share gains reported in Argentina.
Future acquisition activity to spur growth is possible.
Management is accelerating new product launches.

The maintenance of guidance is based on the assumption that the Northern Hemisphere fruit crop -- in particular, apples -- will be in line with historical norms following a relatively poor 2015. The North typically contributes 70%-75% of sales and 80%-90% of EBITDA. However, unless you can accurately predict the weather for the next four to five months, it's impossible to know exactly how the crop will turn out. The only thing we know for sure is that the apple harvest and the SmartFresh product remain the most important drivers of AgroFresh's prospects. 





New products
That said, management plans to accelerate the launch and sales development of new products, and it spent a fair amount of time discussing them on the earnings call. 

Harvista, which helps farmers expand the harvest window and reduce fruit drop, is expected to contribute around $14 million in revenue in 2016, with Chairman Nancy Dicciani expecting "an incremental $40 million revenue potential within five years." 
Investment in Harvista ground sprayers in the U.S. will enable farmers to lend sprayers and use Harvista on their orchards.
The company is running trials with "20 parties around the globe" with its new RipeLock banana quality management system.
Prototypes for AdvanStore, which monitors the decay of stored fruit, will roll out in the fall.

None of these measures is likely to have a significant impact this year, or reduce dependence on apples or SmartFresh in the near term, but they are evidence of management's plans.
Looking ahead
It's likely to be a busy year for AgroFresh as the company's board continues its search for a new CEO and accelerates new product development. Ultimately, hitting guidance is dependent on favorable weather conditions, but this is par for the course in the agricultural sector. In the long term, the stock price will be dictated by management's ability to open up new markets and stave off any future competition in its core market. A lot to do in 2016.
