Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2
    





September 14, 2016 09:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2. A full list 
      of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations of the class A notes reflect loss coverage 
      levels consistent with their current ratings. Hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) has grown since close, credit losses have been within Fitch's 
      initial expectations, and residual performance has recorded cumulative 
      gains. The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the notes 
      will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed credit and residual 
      loss levels consistent with an 'AAAsf' rating.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in 
      vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current 
      expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage 
      could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual 
      performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss 
      coverage. Due to the growing CE levels and increased loss coverage 
      afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used vehicle 
      values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the updated 
      ratings.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --Class A-2a notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2b notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations of the class A notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with their current ratings. Hard credit enhancement (CE) has grown since close, credit losses have been within Fitch's initial expectations, and residual performance has recorded cumulative gains. The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the notes will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed credit and residual loss levels consistent with an 'AAAsf' rating.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage. Due to the growing CE levels and increased loss coverage afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used vehicle values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the updated ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--Class A-2a notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Criteria for Rating U.S. Auto Lease ABS (pub. 24 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879019Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1011640Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1011640Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2:
    

      --$171,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-2A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-2B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,000,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of 2015-1. 
      Securitized residuals comprise 71.51% of the pool and the 3 Series 
      remains the top model at 22.8% of the pool. Seasoning is consistent at 
      10 months and the weighted average (WA) FICO score has increased to 776.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial CE has decrease by 
      0.10% from 2015-1 and will be 17.05%. CE is composed of a 0.25% reserve 
      account and overcollateralization (OC) of 16.80% growing to a target of 
      18.95% of the initial securitization value (until class A-2 has been 
      paid in full, then the target OC drops to 17.95%). Initial excess spread 
      is 4.84% per annum.
    

      Strong Loss Performance: Credit and residuals performance on BMW FS's 
      portfolio has been strong in recent years. This is a result of robust 
      obligor credit quality and a strong wholesale used vehicle market, 
      leading to higher recovery rates and residuals realizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'BMW Lease Trust 2015-2 -Appendix'. These 
      R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 12, 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'

      Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2
    





October 14, 2015 04:53 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2015-2:
    

      --$171,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$250,000,000 class A-2A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$190,000,000 class A-2B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$308,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$81,000,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of 2015-1. 
      Securitized residuals comprise 71.51% of the pool and the 3 Series 
      remains the top model at 22.8% of the pool. Seasoning is consistent at 
      10 months and the weighted average (WA) FICO score has increased to 776.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial CE has decrease by 
      0.10% from 2015-1 and will be 17.05%. CE is composed of a 0.25% reserve 
      account and overcollateralization (OC) of 16.80% growing to a target of 
      18.95% of the initial securitization value (until class A-2 has been 
      paid in full, then the target OC drops to 17.95%). Initial excess spread 
      is 4.84% per annum.
    

      Strong Loss Performance: Credit and residuals performance on BMW FS's 
      portfolio has been strong in recent years. This is a result of robust 
      obligor credit quality and a strong wholesale used vehicle market, 
      leading to higher recovery rates and residuals realizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG, 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on comparing or recalculating 
      certain information with respect to 100 receivables. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis/conclusions. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E 
      received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained 
      through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating action 
      commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'BMW Lease Trust 2015-2 -Appendix'. These 
      R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 12, 2015.

Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
