Adler's Appetite, previously Suki Jones, was an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2003. As of 2011, the lineup consists of Patrick Stone (lead vocals), Michael Thomas (guitar), Lonnie Paul (guitar), Chip Z'nuff (bass) and Steven Adler (drums, percussion). Along with original material, the band perform covers of Adler's former band Guns N' Roses, primarily songs from the album Appetite for Destruction.
Former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli first formed the band in 2003, with the original lineup consisting of Adler, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate. The band toured the US and Europe, with a number of musicians filling in for band members due to other commitments. Following the departure of Muscat in 2004, they recorded and released the Adler's Appetite EP in January 2005. The same year, Adler announced a new lineup of the band, adding singer Sheldon Tarsha, Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas as well as Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria in place of Pearl, Crane and Kelli.
Adler's Appetite toured before briefly going on hiatus in 2006. They returned in 2007, with Hollywood Roses singer Colby Veil replacing Tarsha, and Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Kristy Majors replacing Longoria. The following year, Tarsha returned to the band, while Majors was replaced by former Quiet Riot and Beautiful Creatures guitarist Alex Grossi. Tarsha's return would be short-lived, once again departing the band with Ladyjack vocalist Rick Stitch joining in his place. With this lineup, they released new material, for the first time since 2005, releasing the singles "Alive," "Stardog" and "Fading" in 2010. When Quiet Riot reformed the same year, Grossi departed Adler's Appetite in 2011, with Ladyjack guitarist Robo filling in for a European tour. However, following the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed the band, replaced by Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone as well as guitarist Lonnie Paul, former lead singer of Tilterworld and former Still Standing guitarist. The band dissolved once the tour was completed, with Adler and Paul forming new band "Adler".

History[edit]
Early years and formation (2003–2004)[edit]



"Steven said that so many people came up to him at the [recent] Suki shows and told him that they had no idea that it was the former Guns N' Roses drummer's new band! Steven wants there to be no question that he is in the band, and while they are playing the Appetite For Destruction material, he believes that Adler's Appetite is more appropriate and less confusing."[5]


—Statement released on name change.
After being fired from Guns N' Roses in 1990,[6] drummer Steven Adler worked on a number of projects, reforming pre-Guns N' Roses band Road Crew,[6] with members of Vain,[7] and briefly joining BulletBoys,[8] before joining a band, in 2003, formed by former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli,[9] which also consisted of Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate.[10] Choosing the name Suki Jones,[11] the band toured the US,[11] making their live debut in Kingman, Arizona in March of the same year.[12] Their sets included songs from the Guns N' Roses albums Appetite for Destruction, G N' R Lies as well as the Live from the Jungle EP[13] and songs by AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and Queen.[12][13] For a May tour of the East Coast, Suki Jones enlisted Warrant guitarist Erik Turner to fill in for Muscat, who had prior touring commitments with Faster Pussycat.[14]
The following month, they renamed the band Adler's Appetite, after Adler and the Appetite for Destruction album that they performed material from regularly.[5] The band briefly parted ways with singer Pearl, who was replaced by Sean Crosby,[15] before he rejoined the band months later.[16] Billed as Suki Jones, Adler's Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood where they were joined onstage by Adler's former Guns N' Roses bandmates, Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of "Mr. Brownstone," "Paradise City" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".[17] A tour of Europe and the US followed from January–February 2004,[16][18] however, a number of the US shows were cancelled, after the promoter failed to pay for transport and the band for the shows they performed.[19][20] Adler's Appetite began writing material for their debut album[21] and signed with Shrapnel Records for its release.[22] A tour of Europe followed from June 25 – July 10, preceded by two US shows in May,[23] during which former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas filled in for Kelli,[24] who had joined Vince Neil's solo band.[25]
Adler's Appetite EP and lineup changes (2004–2006)[edit]
Adler's Appetite began pre-production on their new album in September,[26] with recording of an EP beginning in November.[27] However, prior to recording, guitarist Muscat departed Adler's Appetite.[28] Self-produced, they recorded the album at Dinky Music Recording Studios, in Corona, California, and Vibeville, in Irvine, California.[28] The EP entitled Adler's Appetite featured four original songs[27] and two covers; "Hollywood" by Thin Lizzy and "Draw the Line" by Aerosmith.[28] A cover of Hanoi Rocks song "Obscured" was to be included on the EP[27] but was replaced with the Thin Lizzy cover.[28][29] Adler's Appetite was completed and released, through the band's official website, in January 2005,[29] and was followed by a tour of the US, UK and Europe.[27][29] They were to support Hanoi Rocks for one show in the UK. However, they soon pulled out after Adler made disparaging comments about Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy's wife during an interview.[30] For a number of the headlining shows, guitarist Craig Bedford filled in for Kelli.[31][32]
For a March tour of Japan, Adler's Appetite enlisted Bang Tango and Beautiful Creatures singer Joe Lesté to fill in for Pearl, who cited personal obligations for his absence.[33] Following the tour, it was announced that they had parted ways with Pearl, though he left on good terms[34][35] with singer Sheldon Tarsha brought in as his replacement.[36] A three-date tour of Argentina followed,[36] with the lineup consisting of Adler and Tarsha along with substitute musicians Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures guitarist Michael Thomas and Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria, in place of Kelli and Crane, who couldn't take part in the tour due to other commitments.[37] A number of US shows preceded the Argentina tour.[36] Along with Brides of Destruction and then-former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns, Adler's Appetite, were to tour Asia, in August, under the band name "Guns N' Roses Revisited".[38] However, the tour was soon cancelled when they were told, by Axl Rose's lawyers, that they could not use the Guns N' Roses logo.[39] Adler's Appetite announced a tour of the US, UK and Europe was, taking place from December 31, 2005 to February 11, 2006, as well as plans to release a full-length album the same year.[37] Adler announced prior to the tour that the lineup that toured Argentina was in fact the official new lineup of the band, and that Kelli and Crane had departed the band prior to the tour of Argentina.[40]
Kelli, Crane, and Pearl threatened legal action, stating that none of them quit Adler's Appetite and that the "name and logo are registered trademarks owned by the partnership and its four remaining founding partners (Adler, Kelli, Crane, and Pearl)."[9] They also revealed that no single member could hire or fire another without a majority vote from all four partners.[9] Crane revealed that had Adler dealt with the situation properly, they would have given him the band name and partnership.[41] Several shows into Adler's Appetite European tour, Adler reportedly fired the new lineup, hiring an Italian Guns N' Roses tribute band to replace them, with Z'nuff and Tarsha stating on stage, in Bochum, Germany, that it was Adler's Appetite last show.[42] Ultimately these claims were unfounded, although Thomas left the band at the culmination of the tour. Following the European tour, the band appeared at the Rock the Boat festival, traveling between Oslo, Norway and Fredrikshavn, Denmark, in April,[43][44] with a tour of the US with Bang Tango and Faster Pussycat following in the summer.[45] The band went on hiatus following the conclusion of this tour.
Hiatus and return to touring (2006–2009)[edit]
During the period of inactivity, an unreleased song entitled "Sadder Days," featuring original members Kelli and Crane as well as Tarsha on lead vocals, was posted online in April 2007.[46]
Adler's Appetite reformed in 2007, with a lineup that included Adler and Z'nuff with a returning Michael Thomas and Kristy Majors of Pretty Boy Floyd replacing Longoria on guitars, and Colby Veil of Guns N' Roses cover band Hollywood Roses replacing Tarsha as lead vocalist.[43][47][43] They first performed at Rocklahoma[43] and then proceeded to tour the US from July 28 to August 10 of the same year.[48] The band played a show at the Key Club in Hollywood on July 28, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction. During the show, Adler's Appetite were joing onstage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, with Slash also attending the show.[49][50] During a performance in Mexico City on the tour, Adler fell ill and was treated by paramedics, though he was not hospitalized.[51] A European tour, that was to take place from November 21 – December 15,[52][53] was cancelled with Adler citing personal issues.[54]
The following year, Adler's Appetite played the South Texas Rock Festival on July 12.[55] Kristy Majors was then replaced by new guitarist Alex Grossi, formerly of Quiet Riot, Angry Salad and Beautiful Creatures, in November 2008.[56] The previous month, Adler and Z'nuff formed a supergroup called Guns of Destruction, with L.A. Guns and former Brides of Destruction guitarist Tracii Guns, making their debut on November 19.[57][58] The band was short-lived and Adler's Appetite scheduled a tour for the beginning of 2009 with Tarsha rejoining the band in place of Veil.[59] They embarked on their first full US tour[59] that took place from February 21 – March 20, 2009.[60]
Lineup changes and dissolution Adler's Appetite (2009–2011)[edit]
Following Adler's Appetite's US tour, Tarsha departed the band, in April, to concentrate on his original band.[61] He was subsequently replaced by Ladyjack singer Rick Stitch,[62] with the band announcing more US shows, taking place from April 17 – August 15,[62][63] as well as dates in Brazil and Argentina.[62] From June to July 5, former Quiet Riot bassist Chuck Wright filled in for Z'nuff.[64] Adler's Appetite also began recording new material in July,[65] with hopes of releasing it by the end of 2009.[65]
Adler's Appetite released their first new material, since 2005, with the single "Alive," released in conjunction with Adler's autobiography, My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N' Roses, on July 29, 2010, with a full version released later in the year.[66] The song was later licensed for use on Speed TV's WindTunnel with Dave Despain.[67] Following a 50 date US tour, they began recording their debut album in November[66] with Cinderella drummer Fred Coury producing.[68] The following month they released two more singles entitled "Stardog" and "Fading",[69] which was followed by a tour of Europe and the UK, during which Ladyjack guitarist Robo filled in for Grossi so as to let Grossi rejoin Quiet Riot (with Grossi quitting the band altogether shortly after),[70] taking place from February 10–28.[71][72] During a show in London, Duff McKagan joined the band onstage for renditions of "My Michelle" and "It's So Easy."[73] After the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed Adler's Appetite to focus on Ladyjack.[70] In April, the band announced that Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone had replaced Stitch, while they also added guitarist Lonny Paul to the lineup to replace Grossi.[74] while, the following month, Z'nuff announced the band had signed a new record deal, though he could not reveal the label's name.[75] Adler's Appetite began recording new material on September 26, at NRG Recording Studios.[76] However, it was announced two days later that Z'nuff and Stone were no longer a member of the band,[77] with Adler citing his forming a new band (and subsequent dissolution of Adler's Appetite), with Thomas, Paul, and an unknown singer, as the reasons for his departure.[78] Later it was revealed that Adler's new band was to be named "Adler", and that Thomas was no longer part of the project, leaving only Adler and Paul from Adler's Appetite in the new band. The founding lineup of the new band consisted of Adler, Paul, former Mars Electric vocalist Jacob Bunton and former L.A. Guns bassist Johnny Martin.[79][80]

Adler's Appetite, previously Suki Jones, was an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2003. As of 2011, the lineup consists of Patrick Stone (lead vocals), Michael Thomas (guitar), Lonnie Paul (guitar), Chip Z'nuff (bass) and Steven Adler (drums, percussion). Along with original material, the band perform covers of Adler's former band Guns N' Roses, primarily songs from the album Appetite for Destruction.
Former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli first formed the band in 2003, with the original lineup consisting of Adler, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate. The band toured the US and Europe, with a number of musicians filling in for band members due to other commitments. Following the departure of Muscat in 2004, they recorded and released the Adler's Appetite EP in January 2005. The same year, Adler announced a new lineup of the band, adding singer Sheldon Tarsha, Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas as well as Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria in place of Pearl, Crane and Kelli.
Adler's Appetite toured before briefly going on hiatus in 2006. They returned in 2007, with Hollywood Roses singer Colby Veil replacing Tarsha, and Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Kristy Majors replacing Longoria. The following year, Tarsha returned to the band, while Majors was replaced by former Quiet Riot and Beautiful Creatures guitarist Alex Grossi. Tarsha's return would be short-lived, once again departing the band with Ladyjack vocalist Rick Stitch joining in his place. With this lineup, they released new material, for the first time since 2005, releasing the singles "Alive," "Stardog" and "Fading" in 2010. When Quiet Riot reformed the same year, Grossi departed Adler's Appetite in 2011, with Ladyjack guitarist Robo filling in for a European tour. However, following the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed the band, replaced by Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone as well as guitarist Lonnie Paul, former lead singer of Tilterworld and former Still Standing guitarist. The band dissolved once the tour was completed, with Adler and Paul forming new band "Adler".

History[edit]
Early years and formation (2003–2004)[edit]



"Steven said that so many people came up to him at the [recent] Suki shows and told him that they had no idea that it was the former Guns N' Roses drummer's new band! Steven wants there to be no question that he is in the band, and while they are playing the Appetite For Destruction material, he believes that Adler's Appetite is more appropriate and less confusing."[5]


—Statement released on name change.
After being fired from Guns N' Roses in 1990,[6] drummer Steven Adler worked on a number of projects, reforming pre-Guns N' Roses band Road Crew,[6] with members of Vain,[7] and briefly joining BulletBoys,[8] before joining a band, in 2003, formed by former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli,[9] which also consisted of Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate.[10] Choosing the name Suki Jones,[11] the band toured the US,[11] making their live debut in Kingman, Arizona in March of the same year.[12] Their sets included songs from the Guns N' Roses albums Appetite for Destruction, G N' R Lies as well as the Live from the Jungle EP[13] and songs by AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and Queen.[12][13] For a May tour of the East Coast, Suki Jones enlisted Warrant guitarist Erik Turner to fill in for Muscat, who had prior touring commitments with Faster Pussycat.[14]
The following month, they renamed the band Adler's Appetite, after Adler and the Appetite for Destruction album that they performed material from regularly.[5] The band briefly parted ways with singer Pearl, who was replaced by Sean Crosby,[15] before he rejoined the band months later.[16] Billed as Suki Jones, Adler's Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood where they were joined onstage by Adler's former Guns N' Roses bandmates, Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of "Mr. Brownstone," "Paradise City" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".[17] A tour of Europe and the US followed from January–February 2004,[16][18] however, a number of the US shows were cancelled, after the promoter failed to pay for transport and the band for the shows they performed.[19][20] Adler's Appetite began writing material for their debut album[21] and signed with Shrapnel Records for its release.[22] A tour of Europe followed from June 25 – July 10, preceded by two US shows in May,[23] during which former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas filled in for Kelli,[24] who had joined Vince Neil's solo band.[25]
Adler's Appetite EP and lineup changes (2004–2006)[edit]
Adler's Appetite began pre-production on their new album in September,[26] with recording of an EP beginning in November.[27] However, prior to recording, guitarist Muscat departed Adler's Appetite.[28] Self-produced, they recorded the album at Dinky Music Recording Studios, in Corona, California, and Vibeville, in Irvine, California.[28] The EP entitled Adler's Appetite featured four original songs[27] and two covers; "Hollywood" by Thin Lizzy and "Draw the Line" by Aerosmith.[28] A cover of Hanoi Rocks song "Obscured" was to be included on the EP[27] but was replaced with the Thin Lizzy cover.[28][29] Adler's Appetite was completed and released, through the band's official website, in January 2005,[29] and was followed by a tour of the US, UK and Europe.[27][29] They were to support Hanoi Rocks for one show in the UK. However, they soon pulled out after Adler made disparaging comments about Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy's wife during an interview.[30] For a number of the headlining shows, guitarist Craig Bedford filled in for Kelli.[31][32]
For a March tour of Japan, Adler's Appetite enlisted Bang Tango and Beautiful Creatures singer Joe Lesté to fill in for Pearl, who cited personal obligations for his absence.[33] Following the tour, it was announced that they had parted ways with Pearl, though he left on good terms[34][35] with singer Sheldon Tarsha brought in as his replacement.[36] A three-date tour of Argentina followed,[36] with the lineup consisting of Adler and Tarsha along with substitute musicians Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures guitarist Michael Thomas and Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria, in place of Kelli and Crane, who couldn't take part in the tour due to other commitments.[37] A number of US shows preceded the Argentina tour.[36] Along with Brides of Destruction and then-former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns, Adler's Appetite, were to tour Asia, in August, under the band name "Guns N' Roses Revisited".[38] However, the tour was soon cancelled when they were told, by Axl Rose's lawyers, that they could not use the Guns N' Roses logo.[39] Adler's Appetite announced a tour of the US, UK and Europe was, taking place from December 31, 2005 to February 11, 2006, as well as plans to release a full-length album the same year.[37] Adler announced prior to the tour that the lineup that toured Argentina was in fact the official new lineup of the band, and that Kelli and Crane had departed the band prior to the tour of Argentina.[40]
Kelli, Crane, and Pearl threatened legal action, stating that none of them quit Adler's Appetite and that the "name and logo are registered trademarks owned by the partnership and its four remaining founding partners (Adler, Kelli, Crane, and Pearl)."[9] They also revealed that no single member could hire or fire another without a majority vote from all four partners.[9] Crane revealed that had Adler dealt with the situation properly, they would have given him the band name and partnership.[41] Several shows into Adler's Appetite European tour, Adler reportedly fired the new lineup, hiring an Italian Guns N' Roses tribute band to replace them, with Z'nuff and Tarsha stating on stage, in Bochum, Germany, that it was Adler's Appetite last show.[42] Ultimately these claims were unfounded, although Thomas left the band at the culmination of the tour. Following the European tour, the band appeared at the Rock the Boat festival, traveling between Oslo, Norway and Fredrikshavn, Denmark, in April,[43][44] with a tour of the US with Bang Tango and Faster Pussycat following in the summer.[45] The band went on hiatus following the conclusion of this tour.
Hiatus and return to touring (2006–2009)[edit]
During the period of inactivity, an unreleased song entitled "Sadder Days," featuring original members Kelli and Crane as well as Tarsha on lead vocals, was posted online in April 2007.[46]
Adler's Appetite reformed in 2007, with a lineup that included Adler and Z'nuff with a returning Michael Thomas and Kristy Majors of Pretty Boy Floyd replacing Longoria on guitars, and Colby Veil of Guns N' Roses cover band Hollywood Roses replacing Tarsha as lead vocalist.[43][47][43] They first performed at Rocklahoma[43] and then proceeded to tour the US from July 28 to August 10 of the same year.[48] The band played a show at the Key Club in Hollywood on July 28, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction. During the show, Adler's Appetite were joing onstage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, with Slash also attending the show.[49][50] During a performance in Mexico City on the tour, Adler fell ill and was treated by paramedics, though he was not hospitalized.[51] A European tour, that was to take place from November 21 – December 15,[52][53] was cancelled with Adler citing personal issues.[54]
The following year, Adler's Appetite played the South Texas Rock Festival on July 12.[55] Kristy Majors was then replaced by new guitarist Alex Grossi, formerly of Quiet Riot, Angry Salad and Beautiful Creatures, in November 2008.[56] The previous month, Adler and Z'nuff formed a supergroup called Guns of Destruction, with L.A. Guns and former Brides of Destruction guitarist Tracii Guns, making their debut on November 19.[57][58] The band was short-lived and Adler's Appetite scheduled a tour for the beginning of 2009 with Tarsha rejoining the band in place of Veil.[59] They embarked on their first full US tour[59] that took place from February 21 – March 20, 2009.[60]
Lineup changes and dissolution Adler's Appetite (2009–2011)[edit]
Following Adler's Appetite's US tour, Tarsha departed the band, in April, to concentrate on his original band.[61] He was subsequently replaced by Ladyjack singer Rick Stitch,[62] with the band announcing more US shows, taking place from April 17 – August 15,[62][63] as well as dates in Brazil and Argentina.[62] From June to July 5, former Quiet Riot bassist Chuck Wright filled in for Z'nuff.[64] Adler's Appetite also began recording new material in July,[65] with hopes of releasing it by the end of 2009.[65]
Adler's Appetite released their first new material, since 2005, with the single "Alive," released in conjunction with Adler's autobiography, My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N' Roses, on July 29, 2010, with a full version released later in the year.[66] The song was later licensed for use on Speed TV's WindTunnel with Dave Despain.[67] Following a 50 date US tour, they began recording their debut album in November[66] with Cinderella drummer Fred Coury producing.[68] The following month they released two more singles entitled "Stardog" and "Fading",[69] which was followed by a tour of Europe and the UK, during which Ladyjack guitarist Robo filled in for Grossi so as to let Grossi rejoin Quiet Riot (with Grossi quitting the band altogether shortly after),[70] taking place from February 10–28.[71][72] During a show in London, Duff McKagan joined the band onstage for renditions of "My Michelle" and "It's So Easy."[73] After the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed Adler's Appetite to focus on Ladyjack.[70] In April, the band announced that Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone had replaced Stitch, while they also added guitarist Lonny Paul to the lineup to replace Grossi.[74] while, the following month, Z'nuff announced the band had signed a new record deal, though he could not reveal the label's name.[75] Adler's Appetite began recording new material on September 26, at NRG Recording Studios.[76] However, it was announced two days later that Z'nuff and Stone were no longer a member of the band,[77] with Adler citing his forming a new band (and subsequent dissolution of Adler's Appetite), with Thomas, Paul, and an unknown singer, as the reasons for his departure.[78] Later it was revealed that Adler's new band was to be named "Adler", and that Thomas was no longer part of the project, leaving only Adler and Paul from Adler's Appetite in the new band. The founding lineup of the new band consisted of Adler, Paul, former Mars Electric vocalist Jacob Bunton and former L.A. Guns bassist Johnny Martin.[79][80]

Adler's Appetite, previously Suki Jones, was an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2003. As of 2011, the lineup consists of Patrick Stone (lead vocals), Michael Thomas (guitar), Lonnie Paul (guitar), Chip Z'nuff (bass) and Steven Adler (drums, percussion). Along with original material, the band perform covers of Adler's former band Guns N' Roses, primarily songs from the album Appetite for Destruction.
Former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli first formed the band in 2003, with the original lineup consisting of Adler, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate. The band toured the US and Europe, with a number of musicians filling in for band members due to other commitments. Following the departure of Muscat in 2004, they recorded and released the Adler's Appetite EP in January 2005. The same year, Adler announced a new lineup of the band, adding singer Sheldon Tarsha, Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas as well as Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria in place of Pearl, Crane and Kelli.
Adler's Appetite toured before briefly going on hiatus in 2006. They returned in 2007, with Hollywood Roses singer Colby Veil replacing Tarsha, and Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Kristy Majors replacing Longoria. The following year, Tarsha returned to the band, while Majors was replaced by former Quiet Riot and Beautiful Creatures guitarist Alex Grossi. Tarsha's return would be short-lived, once again departing the band with Ladyjack vocalist Rick Stitch joining in his place. With this lineup, they released new material, for the first time since 2005, releasing the singles "Alive," "Stardog" and "Fading" in 2010. When Quiet Riot reformed the same year, Grossi departed Adler's Appetite in 2011, with Ladyjack guitarist Robo filling in for a European tour. However, following the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed the band, replaced by Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone as well as guitarist Lonnie Paul, former lead singer of Tilterworld and former Still Standing guitarist. The band dissolved once the tour was completed, with Adler and Paul forming new band "Adler".

History[edit]
Early years and formation (2003–2004)[edit]



"Steven said that so many people came up to him at the [recent] Suki shows and told him that they had no idea that it was the former Guns N' Roses drummer's new band! Steven wants there to be no question that he is in the band, and while they are playing the Appetite For Destruction material, he believes that Adler's Appetite is more appropriate and less confusing."[5]


—Statement released on name change.
After being fired from Guns N' Roses in 1990,[6] drummer Steven Adler worked on a number of projects, reforming pre-Guns N' Roses band Road Crew,[6] with members of Vain,[7] and briefly joining BulletBoys,[8] before joining a band, in 2003, formed by former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli,[9] which also consisted of Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate.[10] Choosing the name Suki Jones,[11] the band toured the US,[11] making their live debut in Kingman, Arizona in March of the same year.[12] Their sets included songs from the Guns N' Roses albums Appetite for Destruction, G N' R Lies as well as the Live from the Jungle EP[13] and songs by AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and Queen.[12][13] For a May tour of the East Coast, Suki Jones enlisted Warrant guitarist Erik Turner to fill in for Muscat, who had prior touring commitments with Faster Pussycat.[14]
The following month, they renamed the band Adler's Appetite, after Adler and the Appetite for Destruction album that they performed material from regularly.[5] The band briefly parted ways with singer Pearl, who was replaced by Sean Crosby,[15] before he rejoined the band months later.[16] Billed as Suki Jones, Adler's Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood where they were joined onstage by Adler's former Guns N' Roses bandmates, Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of "Mr. Brownstone," "Paradise City" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".[17] A tour of Europe and the US followed from January–February 2004,[16][18] however, a number of the US shows were cancelled, after the promoter failed to pay for transport and the band for the shows they performed.[19][20] Adler's Appetite began writing material for their debut album[21] and signed with Shrapnel Records for its release.[22] A tour of Europe followed from June 25 – July 10, preceded by two US shows in May,[23] during which former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas filled in for Kelli,[24] who had joined Vince Neil's solo band.[25]
Adler's Appetite EP and lineup changes (2004–2006)[edit]
Adler's Appetite began pre-production on their new album in September,[26] with recording of an EP beginning in November.[27] However, prior to recording, guitarist Muscat departed Adler's Appetite.[28] Self-produced, they recorded the album at Dinky Music Recording Studios, in Corona, California, and Vibeville, in Irvine, California.[28] The EP entitled Adler's Appetite featured four original songs[27] and two covers; "Hollywood" by Thin Lizzy and "Draw the Line" by Aerosmith.[28] A cover of Hanoi Rocks song "Obscured" was to be included on the EP[27] but was replaced with the Thin Lizzy cover.[28][29] Adler's Appetite was completed and released, through the band's official website, in January 2005,[29] and was followed by a tour of the US, UK and Europe.[27][29] They were to support Hanoi Rocks for one show in the UK. However, they soon pulled out after Adler made disparaging comments about Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy's wife during an interview.[30] For a number of the headlining shows, guitarist Craig Bedford filled in for Kelli.[31][32]
For a March tour of Japan, Adler's Appetite enlisted Bang Tango and Beautiful Creatures singer Joe Lesté to fill in for Pearl, who cited personal obligations for his absence.[33] Following the tour, it was announced that they had parted ways with Pearl, though he left on good terms[34][35] with singer Sheldon Tarsha brought in as his replacement.[36] A three-date tour of Argentina followed,[36] with the lineup consisting of Adler and Tarsha along with substitute musicians Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures guitarist Michael Thomas and Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria, in place of Kelli and Crane, who couldn't take part in the tour due to other commitments.[37] A number of US shows preceded the Argentina tour.[36] Along with Brides of Destruction and then-former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns, Adler's Appetite, were to tour Asia, in August, under the band name "Guns N' Roses Revisited".[38] However, the tour was soon cancelled when they were told, by Axl Rose's lawyers, that they could not use the Guns N' Roses logo.[39] Adler's Appetite announced a tour of the US, UK and Europe was, taking place from December 31, 2005 to February 11, 2006, as well as plans to release a full-length album the same year.[37] Adler announced prior to the tour that the lineup that toured Argentina was in fact the official new lineup of the band, and that Kelli and Crane had departed the band prior to the tour of Argentina.[40]
Kelli, Crane, and Pearl threatened legal action, stating that none of them quit Adler's Appetite and that the "name and logo are registered trademarks owned by the partnership and its four remaining founding partners (Adler, Kelli, Crane, and Pearl)."[9] They also revealed that no single member could hire or fire another without a majority vote from all four partners.[9] Crane revealed that had Adler dealt with the situation properly, they would have given him the band name and partnership.[41] Several shows into Adler's Appetite European tour, Adler reportedly fired the new lineup, hiring an Italian Guns N' Roses tribute band to replace them, with Z'nuff and Tarsha stating on stage, in Bochum, Germany, that it was Adler's Appetite last show.[42] Ultimately these claims were unfounded, although Thomas left the band at the culmination of the tour. Following the European tour, the band appeared at the Rock the Boat festival, traveling between Oslo, Norway and Fredrikshavn, Denmark, in April,[43][44] with a tour of the US with Bang Tango and Faster Pussycat following in the summer.[45] The band went on hiatus following the conclusion of this tour.
Hiatus and return to touring (2006–2009)[edit]
During the period of inactivity, an unreleased song entitled "Sadder Days," featuring original members Kelli and Crane as well as Tarsha on lead vocals, was posted online in April 2007.[46]
Adler's Appetite reformed in 2007, with a lineup that included Adler and Z'nuff with a returning Michael Thomas and Kristy Majors of Pretty Boy Floyd replacing Longoria on guitars, and Colby Veil of Guns N' Roses cover band Hollywood Roses replacing Tarsha as lead vocalist.[43][47][43] They first performed at Rocklahoma[43] and then proceeded to tour the US from July 28 to August 10 of the same year.[48] The band played a show at the Key Club in Hollywood on July 28, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction. During the show, Adler's Appetite were joing onstage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, with Slash also attending the show.[49][50] During a performance in Mexico City on the tour, Adler fell ill and was treated by paramedics, though he was not hospitalized.[51] A European tour, that was to take place from November 21 – December 15,[52][53] was cancelled with Adler citing personal issues.[54]
The following year, Adler's Appetite played the South Texas Rock Festival on July 12.[55] Kristy Majors was then replaced by new guitarist Alex Grossi, formerly of Quiet Riot, Angry Salad and Beautiful Creatures, in November 2008.[56] The previous month, Adler and Z'nuff formed a supergroup called Guns of Destruction, with L.A. Guns and former Brides of Destruction guitarist Tracii Guns, making their debut on November 19.[57][58] The band was short-lived and Adler's Appetite scheduled a tour for the beginning of 2009 with Tarsha rejoining the band in place of Veil.[59] They embarked on their first full US tour[59] that took place from February 21 – March 20, 2009.[60]
Lineup changes and dissolution Adler's Appetite (2009–2011)[edit]
Following Adler's Appetite's US tour, Tarsha departed the band, in April, to concentrate on his original band.[61] He was subsequently replaced by Ladyjack singer Rick Stitch,[62] with the band announcing more US shows, taking place from April 17 – August 15,[62][63] as well as dates in Brazil and Argentina.[62] From June to July 5, former Quiet Riot bassist Chuck Wright filled in for Z'nuff.[64] Adler's Appetite also began recording new material in July,[65] with hopes of releasing it by the end of 2009.[65]
Adler's Appetite released their first new material, since 2005, with the single "Alive," released in conjunction with Adler's autobiography, My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N' Roses, on July 29, 2010, with a full version released later in the year.[66] The song was later licensed for use on Speed TV's WindTunnel with Dave Despain.[67] Following a 50 date US tour, they began recording their debut album in November[66] with Cinderella drummer Fred Coury producing.[68] The following month they released two more singles entitled "Stardog" and "Fading",[69] which was followed by a tour of Europe and the UK, during which Ladyjack guitarist Robo filled in for Grossi so as to let Grossi rejoin Quiet Riot (with Grossi quitting the band altogether shortly after),[70] taking place from February 10–28.[71][72] During a show in London, Duff McKagan joined the band onstage for renditions of "My Michelle" and "It's So Easy."[73] After the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed Adler's Appetite to focus on Ladyjack.[70] In April, the band announced that Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone had replaced Stitch, while they also added guitarist Lonny Paul to the lineup to replace Grossi.[74] while, the following month, Z'nuff announced the band had signed a new record deal, though he could not reveal the label's name.[75] Adler's Appetite began recording new material on September 26, at NRG Recording Studios.[76] However, it was announced two days later that Z'nuff and Stone were no longer a member of the band,[77] with Adler citing his forming a new band (and subsequent dissolution of Adler's Appetite), with Thomas, Paul, and an unknown singer, as the reasons for his departure.[78] Later it was revealed that Adler's new band was to be named "Adler", and that Thomas was no longer part of the project, leaving only Adler and Paul from Adler's Appetite in the new band. The founding lineup of the new band consisted of Adler, Paul, former Mars Electric vocalist Jacob Bunton and former L.A. Guns bassist Johnny Martin.[79][80]

Adler's Appetite, previously Suki Jones, was an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 2003. As of 2011, the lineup consists of Patrick Stone (lead vocals), Michael Thomas (guitar), Lonnie Paul (guitar), Chip Z'nuff (bass) and Steven Adler (drums, percussion). Along with original material, the band perform covers of Adler's former band Guns N' Roses, primarily songs from the album Appetite for Destruction.
Former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli first formed the band in 2003, with the original lineup consisting of Adler, Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate. The band toured the US and Europe, with a number of musicians filling in for band members due to other commitments. Following the departure of Muscat in 2004, they recorded and released the Adler's Appetite EP in January 2005. The same year, Adler announced a new lineup of the band, adding singer Sheldon Tarsha, Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas as well as Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria in place of Pearl, Crane and Kelli.
Adler's Appetite toured before briefly going on hiatus in 2006. They returned in 2007, with Hollywood Roses singer Colby Veil replacing Tarsha, and Pretty Boy Floyd guitarist Kristy Majors replacing Longoria. The following year, Tarsha returned to the band, while Majors was replaced by former Quiet Riot and Beautiful Creatures guitarist Alex Grossi. Tarsha's return would be short-lived, once again departing the band with Ladyjack vocalist Rick Stitch joining in his place. With this lineup, they released new material, for the first time since 2005, releasing the singles "Alive," "Stardog" and "Fading" in 2010. When Quiet Riot reformed the same year, Grossi departed Adler's Appetite in 2011, with Ladyjack guitarist Robo filling in for a European tour. However, following the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed the band, replaced by Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone as well as guitarist Lonnie Paul, former lead singer of Tilterworld and former Still Standing guitarist. The band dissolved once the tour was completed, with Adler and Paul forming new band "Adler".

History[edit]
Early years and formation (2003–2004)[edit]



"Steven said that so many people came up to him at the [recent] Suki shows and told him that they had no idea that it was the former Guns N' Roses drummer's new band! Steven wants there to be no question that he is in the band, and while they are playing the Appetite For Destruction material, he believes that Adler's Appetite is more appropriate and less confusing."[5]


—Statement released on name change.
After being fired from Guns N' Roses in 1990,[6] drummer Steven Adler worked on a number of projects, reforming pre-Guns N' Roses band Road Crew,[6] with members of Vain,[7] and briefly joining BulletBoys,[8] before joining a band, in 2003, formed by former Slash's Snakepit guitarist Keri Kelli,[9] which also consisted of Faster Pussycat guitarist Brent Muscat, former Ratt bassist Robbie Crane as well as then-Ratt singer Jizzy Pearl, also formerly of Love/Hate.[10] Choosing the name Suki Jones,[11] the band toured the US,[11] making their live debut in Kingman, Arizona in March of the same year.[12] Their sets included songs from the Guns N' Roses albums Appetite for Destruction, G N' R Lies as well as the Live from the Jungle EP[13] and songs by AC/DC, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin and Queen.[12][13] For a May tour of the East Coast, Suki Jones enlisted Warrant guitarist Erik Turner to fill in for Muscat, who had prior touring commitments with Faster Pussycat.[14]
The following month, they renamed the band Adler's Appetite, after Adler and the Appetite for Destruction album that they performed material from regularly.[5] The band briefly parted ways with singer Pearl, who was replaced by Sean Crosby,[15] before he rejoined the band months later.[16] Billed as Suki Jones, Adler's Appetite performed a show at the Key Club in Hollywood where they were joined onstage by Adler's former Guns N' Roses bandmates, Slash and Izzy Stradlin, for renditions of "Mr. Brownstone," "Paradise City" and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".[17] A tour of Europe and the US followed from January–February 2004,[16][18] however, a number of the US shows were cancelled, after the promoter failed to pay for transport and the band for the shows they performed.[19][20] Adler's Appetite began writing material for their debut album[21] and signed with Shrapnel Records for its release.[22] A tour of Europe followed from June 25 – July 10, preceded by two US shows in May,[23] during which former Beautiful Creatures and Tuff guitarist Michael Thomas filled in for Kelli,[24] who had joined Vince Neil's solo band.[25]
Adler's Appetite EP and lineup changes (2004–2006)[edit]
Adler's Appetite began pre-production on their new album in September,[26] with recording of an EP beginning in November.[27] However, prior to recording, guitarist Muscat departed Adler's Appetite.[28] Self-produced, they recorded the album at Dinky Music Recording Studios, in Corona, California, and Vibeville, in Irvine, California.[28] The EP entitled Adler's Appetite featured four original songs[27] and two covers; "Hollywood" by Thin Lizzy and "Draw the Line" by Aerosmith.[28] A cover of Hanoi Rocks song "Obscured" was to be included on the EP[27] but was replaced with the Thin Lizzy cover.[28][29] Adler's Appetite was completed and released, through the band's official website, in January 2005,[29] and was followed by a tour of the US, UK and Europe.[27][29] They were to support Hanoi Rocks for one show in the UK. However, they soon pulled out after Adler made disparaging comments about Hanoi Rocks guitarist Andy McCoy's wife during an interview.[30] For a number of the headlining shows, guitarist Craig Bedford filled in for Kelli.[31][32]
For a March tour of Japan, Adler's Appetite enlisted Bang Tango and Beautiful Creatures singer Joe Lesté to fill in for Pearl, who cited personal obligations for his absence.[33] Following the tour, it was announced that they had parted ways with Pearl, though he left on good terms[34][35] with singer Sheldon Tarsha brought in as his replacement.[36] A three-date tour of Argentina followed,[36] with the lineup consisting of Adler and Tarsha along with substitute musicians Enuff Z'nuff bassist Chip Z'nuff, former Beautiful Creatures guitarist Michael Thomas and Izzy Stradlin guitarist JT Longoria, in place of Kelli and Crane, who couldn't take part in the tour due to other commitments.[37] A number of US shows preceded the Argentina tour.[36] Along with Brides of Destruction and then-former L.A. Guns guitarist Tracii Guns, Adler's Appetite, were to tour Asia, in August, under the band name "Guns N' Roses Revisited".[38] However, the tour was soon cancelled when they were told, by Axl Rose's lawyers, that they could not use the Guns N' Roses logo.[39] Adler's Appetite announced a tour of the US, UK and Europe was, taking place from December 31, 2005 to February 11, 2006, as well as plans to release a full-length album the same year.[37] Adler announced prior to the tour that the lineup that toured Argentina was in fact the official new lineup of the band, and that Kelli and Crane had departed the band prior to the tour of Argentina.[40]
Kelli, Crane, and Pearl threatened legal action, stating that none of them quit Adler's Appetite and that the "name and logo are registered trademarks owned by the partnership and its four remaining founding partners (Adler, Kelli, Crane, and Pearl)."[9] They also revealed that no single member could hire or fire another without a majority vote from all four partners.[9] Crane revealed that had Adler dealt with the situation properly, they would have given him the band name and partnership.[41] Several shows into Adler's Appetite European tour, Adler reportedly fired the new lineup, hiring an Italian Guns N' Roses tribute band to replace them, with Z'nuff and Tarsha stating on stage, in Bochum, Germany, that it was Adler's Appetite last show.[42] Ultimately these claims were unfounded, although Thomas left the band at the culmination of the tour. Following the European tour, the band appeared at the Rock the Boat festival, traveling between Oslo, Norway and Fredrikshavn, Denmark, in April,[43][44] with a tour of the US with Bang Tango and Faster Pussycat following in the summer.[45] The band went on hiatus following the conclusion of this tour.
Hiatus and return to touring (2006–2009)[edit]
During the period of inactivity, an unreleased song entitled "Sadder Days," featuring original members Kelli and Crane as well as Tarsha on lead vocals, was posted online in April 2007.[46]
Adler's Appetite reformed in 2007, with a lineup that included Adler and Z'nuff with a returning Michael Thomas and Kristy Majors of Pretty Boy Floyd replacing Longoria on guitars, and Colby Veil of Guns N' Roses cover band Hollywood Roses replacing Tarsha as lead vocalist.[43][47][43] They first performed at Rocklahoma[43] and then proceeded to tour the US from July 28 to August 10 of the same year.[48] The band played a show at the Key Club in Hollywood on July 28, as part of their tour celebrating the 20th anniversary of Appetite for Destruction. During the show, Adler's Appetite were joing onstage by former Guns N' Roses members Izzy Stradlin and Duff McKagan, with Slash also attending the show.[49][50] During a performance in Mexico City on the tour, Adler fell ill and was treated by paramedics, though he was not hospitalized.[51] A European tour, that was to take place from November 21 – December 15,[52][53] was cancelled with Adler citing personal issues.[54]
The following year, Adler's Appetite played the South Texas Rock Festival on July 12.[55] Kristy Majors was then replaced by new guitarist Alex Grossi, formerly of Quiet Riot, Angry Salad and Beautiful Creatures, in November 2008.[56] The previous month, Adler and Z'nuff formed a supergroup called Guns of Destruction, with L.A. Guns and former Brides of Destruction guitarist Tracii Guns, making their debut on November 19.[57][58] The band was short-lived and Adler's Appetite scheduled a tour for the beginning of 2009 with Tarsha rejoining the band in place of Veil.[59] They embarked on their first full US tour[59] that took place from February 21 – March 20, 2009.[60]
Lineup changes and dissolution Adler's Appetite (2009–2011)[edit]
Following Adler's Appetite's US tour, Tarsha departed the band, in April, to concentrate on his original band.[61] He was subsequently replaced by Ladyjack singer Rick Stitch,[62] with the band announcing more US shows, taking place from April 17 – August 15,[62][63] as well as dates in Brazil and Argentina.[62] From June to July 5, former Quiet Riot bassist Chuck Wright filled in for Z'nuff.[64] Adler's Appetite also began recording new material in July,[65] with hopes of releasing it by the end of 2009.[65]
Adler's Appetite released their first new material, since 2005, with the single "Alive," released in conjunction with Adler's autobiography, My Appetite for Destruction: Sex, and Drugs, and Guns N' Roses, on July 29, 2010, with a full version released later in the year.[66] The song was later licensed for use on Speed TV's WindTunnel with Dave Despain.[67] Following a 50 date US tour, they began recording their debut album in November[66] with Cinderella drummer Fred Coury producing.[68] The following month they released two more singles entitled "Stardog" and "Fading",[69] which was followed by a tour of Europe and the UK, during which Ladyjack guitarist Robo filled in for Grossi so as to let Grossi rejoin Quiet Riot (with Grossi quitting the band altogether shortly after),[70] taking place from February 10–28.[71][72] During a show in London, Duff McKagan joined the band onstage for renditions of "My Michelle" and "It's So Easy."[73] After the tour, both Stitch and Robo departed Adler's Appetite to focus on Ladyjack.[70] In April, the band announced that Aces 'N' Eights singer Patrick Stone had replaced Stitch, while they also added guitarist Lonny Paul to the lineup to replace Grossi.[74] while, the following month, Z'nuff announced the band had signed a new record deal, though he could not reveal the label's name.[75] Adler's Appetite began recording new material on September 26, at NRG Recording Studios.[76] However, it was announced two days later that Z'nuff and Stone were no longer a member of the band,[77] with Adler citing his forming a new band (and subsequent dissolution of Adler's Appetite), with Thomas, Paul, and an unknown singer, as the reasons for his departure.[78] Later it was revealed that Adler's new band was to be named "Adler", and that Thomas was no longer part of the project, leaving only Adler and Paul from Adler's Appetite in the new band. The founding lineup of the new band consisted of Adler, Paul, former Mars Electric vocalist Jacob Bunton and former L.A. Guns bassist Johnny Martin.[79][80]

Michael Sadler




















Spartacus Educational






















Michael Sadler


Michael Sadler, the youngest son of James Sadler, was born in Snelston, Derbyshire on 3rd January 1780. His family, though members of the Church of England, were in sympathy with the Methodist movement. At the age of seventeen Sadler published a pamphlet, An Apology for the Methodists (1797).
In 1800 Sadler moved to to Leeds where he worked for his father. In 1810 Sadler joined with his brother, Benjamin Sadler, to establish a company importing Irish linen. He also served as honorary treasurer of the poor rates. During this period Sadler became concerned about the condition of children working in local factories.
He argued against those who supported an unregulated society. He suggested that in a "society in which persons enjoyed unequal measures of economic freedom, it was not true that the individual pursuit of self-interest would necessarily lead to collective well-being." He added that "individual effort needed to be restrained and guided by the conscience of the community acting through the organisation of the state."
In 1829 the Duke of Newcastle offered Sadler the seat of Newark in the House of Commons. Elected with a majority of 214 votes, Sadler soon established himself as one of the best parliamentary speakers of the day. In 1831 Sadler moved to the safer seat of Aldborough.
Pamphlets published by Sadler included The State and Prospects of the Country (1829), The Factory Girl's Last Day (1830), On Poor Laws for Ireland (1830), On Ministerial Plan of Reform (1831) and On the Distress of the Agricultural Labourers (1831).
In October 1831 Sadler began his campaign to improve the condition of the agricultural labourers in Britain. He proposed: (1) the erection of suitable cottages by the parish authorities; (2) the provision of allotments large enough to feed a cow; (3) the provision of gardens to encourage horticulture among the labourers; (4) the provision of parish land for unemployed labourers.
Sadler was strongly supported by John Wood, who owned the most successful worsted spinning business in Britain. Wood donated £40,000 to Sadler's campaign for a ten-hour bill, aimed at reducing the excessive hours worked by children. According to his biographer, Gary Firth: "Throughout 1832 Wood canvassed for Sadler at Westminster, and that year he attended a large Easter rally in York.... In October 1832 Wood employed the Revd Matthew Balme as schoolmaster of a purpose-built school adjoining his mill."
On 16th March 1832 Sadler introduced legislation that proposed limiting the hours of all persons under the age of 18 to ten hours a day. He argued: "The parents rouse them in the morning and receive them tired and exhausted after the day has closed; they see them droop and sicken, and, in many cases, become cripples and die, before they reach their prime; and they do all this, because they must otherwise starve. It is a mockery to contend that these parents have a choice. They choose the lesser evil, and reluctantly resign their offspring to the captivity and pollution of the mill."
William James disagreed with Michael Sadler's views: "I have no doubt that the right honourable member (Michael Sadler) is actuated by the best intentions and motives, but I think that the course which he pursues will fail in attaining the object which he has in view. Undoubtedly the system which is pursued in these manufactories relating to the working of young children is a great evil; but it appears to me that the remedy which the honourable gentleman proposes to apply is worse than the disease. There appears to me to be only a choice of evils - the children must either work or starve. If the manufacturer is prevented working his mill for more than a certain number of hours together, he will often be unable to execute the orders which he may receive, and consequently, the purchaser must go to foreign countries for a supply. The result will be that you will drive the English capitalist to foreign countries, where there is no restrictions upon the employment of labour and capital."
Henry Thomas Hope agreed: "It is obvious, that if you limit the hours of labour, you will, to nearly the same extent, reduce the profits of the capital on which the labour is employed. Under these circumstances, the manufacturers must either raise the price of the manufactured article or diminish the wages of their workmen. If they raise the price of the article the foreigner gains an advantage. I am informed that the foreign cotton-manufacturers, and particularly the Americans, tread closely upon the heels of our manufacturers. The right honourable member (Michael Sadler) seems to consider that it is desirable for adults to replace children. I cannot concur with that opinion, because I think that the labour of children is a great resource to their parents and of great benefit to themselves. I therefore, on the these grounds, oppose this measure. In the first place I doubt whether parliament can protect children as effectively as their parents; secondly; because I am of the opinion that a case for parliamentary interference has not yet been made out; and thirdly, because I believe that the bill will be productive of great inconvenience, not only to persons who have embarked large capital in the cotton manufactures, but even to workmen and children themselves - that I feel it my duty to oppose this measure."
The vast majority of the House of Commons were opposed to Sadler's proposal. However, in April 1832 it was agreed that there should be another parliamentary enquiry into child labour. Sadler was made chairman and for the next three months a parliamentary committee, that included John Cam Hobhouse, Charles Poulett Thompson, Robert Peel, Lord Morpeth, and Thomas Fowell Buxton interviewed 89 witnesses.
On 9th July Michael Sadler discovered that at least six of these workers had been sacked for giving evidence to the parliamentary committee. Sadler announced that this victimisation meant that he could no longer ask factory workers to be interviewed. He now concentrated on interviewing doctors who had experience treating people who worked in textile factories.
Sadler was one of the chief speakers at the meeting organised by Richard Oastler at York on 24th April 1832. Later that year 16,000 people assembled in Fixby Park, near Huddersfield, to thank him for his work on behalf of child workers.
In the 1832 General Election, Sadler's opponent was John Marshall, the Leeds flax-spinning magnate. Marshall used his considerable influence to win the election and Sadler was now without a seat in the House of Commons.
Sadler's report was published in January 1833. The information in the report shocked the British public and Parliament came under increasing pressure to protect the children working in factories. Lord Ashley, son and heir of the 6th Earl of Shaftesbury, agreed to take over from Sadler as the leader of the factory reform movement in Parliament.
Michael Sadler died in Belfast on 29th July 1835.

(1) Michael Sadler, speech in the House of Commons, 16th March 1832.

The parents rouse them in the morning and receive them tired and exhausted after the day has closed; they see them droop and sicken, and, in many cases, become cripples and die, before they reach their prime; and they do all this, because they must otherwise starve. It is a mockery to contend that these parents have a choice. They choose the lesser evil, and reluctantly resign their offspring to the captivity and pollution of the mill.



(2) Henry Thomas Hope, speech, House of Commons (16th March, 1832)

It is obvious, that if you limit the hours of labour, you will, to nearly the same extent, reduce the profits of the capital on which the labour is employed. Under these circumstances, the manufacturers must either raise the price of the manufactured article or diminish the wages of their workmen. If they raise the price of the article the foreigner gains an advantage. I am informed that the foreign cotton-manufacturers, and particularly the Americans, tread closely upon the heels of our manufacturers.
The right honourable member (Michael Sadler) seems to consider that it is desirable for adults to replace children. I cannot concur with that opinion, because I think that the labour of children is a great resource to their parents and of great benefit to themselves.
I therefore, on the these grounds, oppose this measure.

The result will be that you will drive the English capitalist to foreign countries, where there is no restrictions upon the employment of labour and capital.



(4) Lord Ashley, personal memorandum, February 1833.

In the autumn and winter of 1832 I read in The Times some extracts from the evidence taken before Sadler's Committee. I was astonished and disgusted by what I read. I wrote to Sadler offering my services. In February the Rev. George Bull asked me to take up the question that Sadler had been forced to drop. I can perfectly recollect my astonishment, and doubt, and terror, at the proposition.
