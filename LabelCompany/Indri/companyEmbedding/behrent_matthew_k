Behrent's Performance Warehouse would like to announce that we are offering extended savings on any products to all our loyal committed racers who shop regularly at Behrents. Contact Jon Lynch at 845-651-7389 or email him at jlynch@behrents.com.












NJ RULES 

NEW JERSEY MANDATES HEAD AND NECK RESTRAINTS FOR DIRT AND PAVEMENT
New Jersey is the first state to make a move toward safety that could potentially push other states to take action. The New Jersey State Police, which uniquely is charged with regulating motorsports in their state, has taken steps to mandate an SF1 38.1 head and neck restraint device starting in March of 2015.












DRACO 

BEHRENTS ADDS DRACO SPRINGS
Draco Front Springs are available in several different sizes for various applications including dirt and asphalt late models. Draco manufactures these springs with the fewest coils and the largest coil gap on the market with the maximum amount of coil removed to keep the weight down to achieve maximum travel with a linear rate. These springs are designed for the racer who demands quality and consistency.
