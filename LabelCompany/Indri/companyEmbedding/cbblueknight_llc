Blueknight Energy Partners Completes Acquisition of Nine Asphalt Terminals from Ergon for $108.8 million and Ergon Completes Acquisition of Blueknight's General Partner



      Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: BKEP) (Common Units) (NASDAQ: 
      BKEPP) (Series A Preferred Units) ("BKEP" 
      or the "Partnership"), announced today that 
      Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc., a subsidiary of Jackson, 
      Mississippi-based Ergon, Inc. ("Ergon"), 
      completed its acquisition of the entity that owns the general partner of 
      BKEP. Ergon also (i) contributed nine asphalt terminals it previously 
      owned plus $22.1 million of cash to BKEP in return for an aggregate of 
      18,312,968 Series A preferred units and (ii) acquired 847,457 common 
      units for approximately $5.0 million in a private placement. In 
      addition, BKEP repurchased 13,335,390 of its Series A preferred units 
      previously owned by Blueknight Energy Holding, Inc. ("Vitol") 
      and CB-Blueknight, LLC ("Charlesbank Capital 
      Partners" or "Charlesbank") for 
      approximately $95.3 million. Vitol and Charlesbank each retained 
      2,488,789 Series A preferred units. The nine terminals acquired by BKEP 
      from Ergon are located in Wolcott, Kansas; Ennis, Texas; Chandler, 
      Arizona; Mt. Pleasant, Texas; Pleasanton, Texas; Birmingport, Alabama; 
      Memphis, Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee; and Yellow Creek, Mississippi, 
      and include approximately 2.0 million barrels of storage capacity.
    
      In connection with the transactions described above, BKEP entered into a 
      seven year storage, throughput and handling agreement with Ergon. Under 
      the terms of the agreement, BKEP will provide storage and terminalling 
      services at the nine terminals in exchange for the payment of certain 
      fees by Ergon.
    
      BKEP also announces the addition of five new members of its Board of 
      Directors of the General Partner. They are William W. Lampton, Robert H. 
      Lampton, Jimmy A. Langdon, Donald M. Brooks and Edward Drew Brooks. They 
      will be replacing the board members affiliated with Vitol and 
      Charlesbank.
    
      Comments from BKEP CEO Mark Hurley:
    
      "We are excited to announce the completion of this transaction. It is a 
      transformative event for Blueknight and is anticipated to result in 
      immediate and long-term growth for our unitholders. Ergon is an 
      exceptional company with a solid track record and a like-minded 
      disciplined approach to management. We are excited to have them as a 
      valued strategic partner."

Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. Announces Debt Refinancing And Agreement For Charlesbank To Become A Joint Controlling Party With Vitol






Business Wire




Oct 25, 2010 5:00 PM EDT













 


















































  Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (Pink Sheets: BKEP) (“BKEP” or the “Partnership”), a midstream energy company focused on providing integrated terminalling, storage, processing, gathering and transportation services for companies engaged in the production, distribution and marketing of crude oil and asphalt product, today announced that it has raised new equity, repaid in full the existing indebtedness under its prior credit agreement and will hold a unitholder meeting regarding certain unitholder proposals pursuant to a Global Transaction Agreement described in more detail below.  In addition, the Partnership has been informed that CB-Blueknight, LLC (“Charlesbank Holding”), an affiliate of Charlesbank Capital Partners, LLC, has entered into an agreement with Blueknight Energy Holding, Inc. (“Vitol Holding”), an affiliate of Vitol Holding B.V., to purchase 50% of the membership interests in the entity that controls the Partnership’s general partner. Because this is a private transaction, financial terms were not disclosed. The agreement is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals.  “We look forward to a new chapter in Blueknight’s history. With the refinancing of its debt, Blueknight is positioned to take advantage of new investment opportunities with a focus on building unitholder value rather than dealing with legacy debt issues,” stated James Dyer, chief executive officer and director of the Partnership’s general partner who is affiliated with Vitol Holding. Further, Mr. Dyer explained, “Vitol’s increased investment in Blueknight reflects Vitol’s confidence in the company. The Partnership has made great strides over the past 10 months to stabilize operations and reposition the company with customers and the market. We are excited to welcome Charlesbank as a partner who is committed to Blueknight’s success.”  Jon Biotti, Charlesbank managing director, said, “We are impressed with the quality and depth of Blueknight’s management team and are delighted to partner with Vitol to continue the process of repositioning the company. We look forward to supporting Blueknight as it continues to improve its operations and grow its business over the long term.”

      in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to

OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: BKEP) (Common Units) (NASDAQ: 
      BKEPP) (Series A Preferred Units) (“BKEP” 
      or the “Partnership”), announced today that 
      Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc., a subsidiary of Jackson, 
      Mississippi-based Ergon, Inc. (“Ergon”), 
      has agreed to purchase 100% of the membership interests of Blueknight GP 
      Holding, L.L.C., which owns 100% of the outstanding membership interests 
      of the general partner of BKEP, which owns the general partner interest 
      and the incentive distribution rights of BKEP. Ergon also has agreed to 
      (i) contribute nine asphalt terminals it currently owns plus $22.1 
      million of cash to BKEP in return for total consideration of 
      approximately $130.9 million, which consists of the issuance of 
      18,312,968 Series A preferred units in a private placement, and (ii) 
      acquire an aggregate of $5.0 million of common units for cash in a 
      private placement. In addition, BKEP has agreed to repurchase 13,335,390 
      of its Series A preferred units currently owned by Blueknight Energy 
      Holding, Inc. (“Vitol”) and CB-Blueknight, 
      LLC (“Charlesbank” and, together with 
      Vitol, the “Existing Sponsors”) for $95.3 
      million. The Existing Sponsors will retain their remaining 4,977,578 
      Series A preferred units. The nine terminals acquired by BKEP from Ergon 
      are located in Wolcott, Kansas; Ennis, Texas; Chandler, Arizona; Mt. 
      Pleasant, Texas; Pleasanton, Texas; Birmingport, Alabama; Memphis, 
      Tennessee; Nashville, Tennessee; and Yellow Creek, Mississippi, and 
      include approximately 2.0 million barrels of storage capacity. Once the 
      transactions described above have closed, Blueknight will own a network 
      of 54 asphalt terminals in 26 states with a combined capacity of 10.2 
      million barrels of asphalt and residual fuel oil storage.
    

      Ergon’s purchase of Blueknight GP Holding, L.L.C., Ergon’s contribution 
      of terminals and cash to BKEP and BKEP’s repurchase of the Existing 
      Sponsors’ Series A preferred units is conditioned on the closing of each 
      of the other transactions. In addition, the transactions are subject to 
      other customary closing conditions, including expiration of the 
      applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust 
      Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other regulatory approvals and 
      the distribution to holders of Series A preferred units of an 
      information statement on Schedule 14C. Such transactions are expected to 
      close on or before September 30, 2016. BKEP has amended its credit 
      facility to address this change of control and has modified certain 
      terms of the facility, the terms of which will be filed on Form 8-K with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
    

      The Conflicts Committee of the board of directors of Blueknight Energy 
      Partners G.P., L.L.C., the general partner of BKEP, has approved Ergon’s 
      contribution of terminals and cash to BKEP and BKEP’s repurchase of the 
      Existing Sponsors’ Series A preferred units. Evercore served as 
      financial advisor to the Conflicts Committee and Potter Anderson & 
      Corroon LLP served as legal counsel to the Conflicts Committee.
    

      Wells Fargo Securities, LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to 
      Ergon.
    

      Comments from BKEP CEO Mark Hurley:
    

      “We look forward to a new era with Ergon as the future owner of our 
      general partner. As a long-term customer at 18 of our asphalt terminals 
      we have admired their capabilities and expertise. We also have come to 
      realize we share the same values to operate with discipline and 
      integrity. The strategic combination of the two companies and the 
      addition of nine asphalt facilities to our portfolio will create 
      opportunities for growth and increased shareholder value over the 
      long-term. Our two businesses offer a collection of compatible 
      operations which further enhance and strengthen our diversification. In 
      addition to the purchase of the general partner from Vitol and 
      Charlesbank and nine additional asphalt terminals, Ergon will enter into 
      an exclusive long-term services agreement for the facilities. We expect 
      this transaction to be immediately accretive to the Partnership 
      generating an anticipated first year cash flow multiple in the 8-9 times 
      range. As we move forward with the transaction, we do not anticipate our 
      current base business or customer relationships to be impacted. We will 
      continue to serve a variety of customers across our terminalling and 
      transportation businesses. Vitol and Charlesbank have been instrumental 
      in the development of our company and they have put us in the position 
      to pursue this transformative opportunity with Ergon. Vitol, in addition 
      to being an important strategic sponsor, is also a significant customer. 
      We expect our customer relationship with Vitol to remain in place moving 
      forward.”
    

      Comments from Ergon Asphalt & Emulsions, Inc. Chairman Bill Lampton:
    

      “Ergon has had a long-term desire to help build a world class midstream 
      Master Limited Partnership and believes its investment in Blueknight 
      will help achieve that goal. We believe that we are an ideal sponsor to 
      help support and facilitate the growth of Blueknight through our 
      experience in the ownership of pipelines, terminalling and storage 
      facilities and other similar assets. We expect Blueknight to be a growth 
      vehicle on its own with support from Ergon. We have also identified two 
      additional terminals that may be dropped into Blueknight over the next 
      couple of years. We expect that those drop downs would be of similar 
      size to other successful acquisitions completed by Blueknight in the 
      last 18 months. We also value the diversity of customers that Blueknight 
      currently enjoys and will continue to encourage the development and 
      expansion of those relationships. We do not anticipate any day-to-day 
      changes with the overall operation of Blueknight’s business.”
    

      Comments from Charlesbank/Vitol:
    

      “We have valued our partnership with Blueknight but see this as a 
      strategic opportunity for the company. Ergon has been a long-term 
      customer for BKEP and its businesses are strategically aligned with the 
      Partnership’s business. In addition, we at Vitol have enjoyed a 
      long-term business relationship and would expect to continue that 
      relationship going forward. We believe we are leaving the Partnership in 
      capable hands and wish the company the best in the future.”

Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. Announces Debt Refinancing and Agreement for Charlesbank to Become a Joint Controlling Party with Vitol | Business Wire


























































Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. Announces Debt Refinancing 
      and Agreement for Charlesbank to Become a Joint Controlling Party with 
      Vitol






October 25, 2010 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



TULSA, Okla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P. (Pink Sheets: BKEP) (“BKEP” or the 
      “Partnership”), a midstream energy company focused on providing 
      integrated terminalling, storage, processing, gathering and 
      transportation services for companies engaged in the production, 
      distribution and marketing of crude oil and asphalt product, today 
      announced that it has raised new equity, repaid in full the existing 
      indebtedness under its prior credit agreement and will hold a unitholder 
      meeting regarding certain unitholder proposals pursuant to a Global 
      Transaction Agreement described in more detail below.
    


      In addition, the Partnership has been informed that CB-Blueknight, LLC 
      (“Charlesbank Holding”), an affiliate of Charlesbank Capital Partners, 
      LLC, has entered into an agreement with Blueknight Energy Holding, Inc. 
      (“Vitol Holding”), an affiliate of Vitol Holding B.V., to purchase 50% 
      of the membership interests in the entity that controls the 
      Partnership’s general partner. Because this is a private transaction, 
      financial terms were not disclosed. The agreement is subject to 
      customary closing conditions and approvals.
    

      “We look forward to a new chapter in Blueknight’s history. With the 
      refinancing of its debt, Blueknight is positioned to take advantage of 
      new investment opportunities with a focus on building unitholder value 
      rather than dealing with legacy debt issues,” stated James Dyer, chief 
      executive officer and director of the Partnership’s general partner who 
      is affiliated with Vitol Holding. Further, Mr. Dyer explained, “Vitol’s 
      increased investment in Blueknight reflects Vitol’s confidence in the 
      company. The Partnership has made great strides over the past 10 months 
      to stabilize operations and reposition the company with customers and 
      the market. We are excited to welcome Charlesbank as a partner who is 
      committed to Blueknight’s success.”
    

      Jon Biotti, Charlesbank managing director, said, “We are impressed with 
      the quality and depth of Blueknight’s management team and are delighted 
      to partner with Vitol to continue the process of repositioning the 
      company. We look forward to supporting Blueknight as it continues to 
      improve its operations and grow its business over the long term.”
    

      The Global Transaction Agreement outlines a series of transactions 
      related to the refinancing of the Partnership’s existing debt and the 
      recapitalization of the Partnership’s securities. Generally, these 
      transactions are separated into three types of transactions: (i) Phase I 
      Transactions, (ii) Unitholder Vote Transactions and (iii) Phase II 
      Transactions. Each of these transactions and the corresponding documents 
      are outlined in more detail below. Copies of the Global Transaction 
      Agreement and the agreements entered into in connection therewith will 
      be available in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed by the 
      Partnership on the date hereof.
    

      The Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Partnership’s general 
      partner approved the Global Transaction Agreement and the transactions 
      contemplated therein based on a recommendation from its Conflicts 
      Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors. The 
      Conflicts Committee retained independent legal and financial advisors to 
      assist it in evaluating the Global Transaction Agreement and the 
      transactions contemplated thereby and considered a number of factors in 
      approving the Global Transaction Agreement and such transactions, 
      including an opinion from the Conflicts Committee’s independent 
      financial advisor that the Transactions are fair, in aggregate, from a 
      financial point of view, to the public unaffiliated common unitholders 
      of the Partnership.
    

Phase I Transactions


      The Partnership completed the following Phase I Transactions 
      concurrently with the execution of the Global Transaction Agreement:
    


        entering into a new credit agreement, which includes a $200 million 
        term loan facility and a $75 million revolving loan facility;
      

        issuing an aggregate of 21,538,462 Series A Preferred Units (the 
        “Preferred Units”) to Vitol Holding and Charlesbank Holding for a cash 
        purchase price of $6.50 per Preferred Unit in a privately negotiated 
        transaction (the “Private Placement”) and granting Vitol Holding and 
        Charlesbank Holding certain registration rights pursuant to a 
        Registration Rights Agreement for the resale of Common Units issued as 
        a result of the conversion of their Preferred Units; and
      

        issuing Convertible Subordinated Debentures to Vitol Holding and 
        Charlesbank Holding in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, 
        with such debentures being convertible into Preferred Units on 
        December 31, 2011 if not earlier redeemed from proceeds from an equity 
        offering.
      


      The Partnership used borrowings under its new credit agreement together 
      with proceeds from the Private Placement and the sale of the Convertible 
      Subordinated Debentures: (i) to repay all existing indebtedness under 
      the Partnership’s prior credit agreement, (ii) to pay certain 
      transaction expenses incurred in connection with the Global Transaction 
      Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including a payment 
      of approximately $350,000 to each of Vitol Holding and Charlesbank 
      Holding as partial reimbursement of their expenses incurred in 
      connection with the negotiation and preparation of the Global 
      Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and 
      (iii) for general partnership purposes. Vitol Refining Group B.V., an 
      affiliate of Vitol Holding B.V., is a lender under the new credit 
      agreement.
    

Unitholder Vote Transactions


      Pursuant to the Global Transaction Agreement, the Partnership’s general 
      partner has agreed to convene a special meeting (the “Unitholder 
      Meeting”) of holders of the Partnership’s Common Units and Subordinated 
      Units to consider and vote upon the following unitholder proposals (the 
      “Unitholder Proposals”):
    


        approval to amend the Partnership’s partnership agreement to reset the 
        Minimum Quarterly Distribution (as defined in the partnership 
        agreement) to $0.09 per unit per quarter from $0.3125 per unit per 
        quarter and corresponding adjustments to the other Target 
        Distributions, each effective as of the first day of the quarter 
        during which the unitholders approve the Unitholder Proposals;
      

        approval of the waiver of the Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage (as 
        defined in the partnership agreement) due and owing through the 
        quarter prior to the quarter during which the unitholders approve the 
        Unitholder Proposals; and
      

        approval to amend the Partnership’s partnership agreement to provide 
        that no Minimum Quarterly Distribution dividends shall accrue or be 
        paid to the holders of Subordinated Units during the four-quarter 
        period following the date that the unitholders approve the Unitholder 
        Proposals and that, instead, such Minimum Quarterly Distributions that 
        would otherwise be paid to the holders of Subordinated Units will be 
        paid to holders of Common Units, with the Conflicts Committee 
        determining the amount of any such distribution.
      


      The Board and the Conflicts Committee has each recommended that the 
      public unitholders approve the Unitholder Proposals. The Unitholder 
      Proposals must be approved by a majority of the outstanding Common Units 
      held by non-affiliates of Vitol Holding and Charlesbank Holding. The 
      Preferred Units are not entitled to vote upon the Unitholder Proposals.
    

Phase II Transactions


      Pursuant to the Global Transaction Agreement, upon the approval of the 
      Unitholder Proposals, the following Phase II Transactions will take 
      place:
    


        the Partnership’s general partner will amend the Partnership’s 
        partnership agreement to reflect the approval of the Unitholder 
        Proposals;
      

        no later than 20 days after the date of the approval of the Unitholder 
        Proposals (the “Unitholder Approval Date”), the Partnership will issue 
        and sell to Vitol Holding and Charlesbank Holding an aggregate of 
        2,615,386 Preferred Units (1,307,693 Preferred Units to Vitol Holding 
        and Charlesbank Holding, respectively) for a cash purchase price of 
        $6.50 per Preferred Unit in a private transaction (the “Additional 
        Private Placement”), resulting in total gross proceeds of 
        approximately $17 million, such proceeds to be used to make the 
        Special Distribution (as defined below);
      

        no later than 15 days after the Unitholder Approval Date, the 
        Partnership’s general partner will declare a distribution in favor of 
        the holders of the Common Units in the amount of $0.78 per Common Unit 
        (the “Special Distribution”), such Special Distribution to be paid no 
        later than 45 days after the Unitholder Approval Date; and
      

        the Partnership will undertake to complete a rights offering pursuant 
        to which the Partnership will distribute to its existing common 
        unitholders 0.5310 rights for each outstanding Common Unit, with each 
        whole right entitling the holder to acquire, for a subscription price 
        of $6.50, a newly issued Preferred Unit (the “Rights Offering”), with 
        the proceeds from such Rights Offering being used to redeem the 
        Convertible Subordinated Debentures and for general partnership 
        purposes. These newly issued Preferred Units will be identical to the 
        Preferred Units issued to Vitol Holding and Charlesbank Holding in the 
        Private Placement.

Explanatory Note. 
This Amendment No. 1 (this Amendment) to Schedule 13D amends and supplements the Schedule 13D (the
Original 13D) originally filed by CB-Blueknight, LLC (Charlesbank), Charlesbank Equity Fund VII, Limited Partnership (Fund VII), Charlesbank Equity Fund VII GP, Limited
Partnership (Fund VII GP), and Charlesbank Capital Partners, LLC (Charlesbank Capital) (collectively, the Reporting Persons) on September 27, 2016, relating to common
units representing limited partner interests (Common Units) in Blueknight Energy Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Issuer). The Reporting Persons hold Series A preferred units
representing limited partner interests (Series A Preferred Units) in the Issuer. The Series A Preferred Units are convertible into Common Units on a one-for-one basis at the holders option, as set forth in the Fourth
Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Issuer, dated September 14, 2011 (the Partnership Agreement). Except as amended or supplemented by this Amendment, the Original 13D is unchanged. 
Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration 
This Item 3 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 3 of the Original 13D. 
On October 5, 2016, the transactions (collectively, the Transactions) contemplated by each of the following
agreements closed: (i) the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the MIPA) dated July 19, 2016 among Blueknight Energy Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (BEHI), Charlesbank, Ergon
Asphalt Holdings, LLC (EAH), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ergon, Inc. (Ergon), and the other parties thereto; (ii) the Preferred Unit Repurchase Agreement (the Repurchase
Agreement) dated July 19, 2016 among BEHI, Charlesbank and the Issuer; and (iii) the Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) dated July 19, 2016 among the Issuer, Blueknight Terminal
Holding, L.L.C., and three indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of Ergon.  Pursuant to the MIPA, EAH purchased 100% of the membership
interests in Blueknight GP Holding, LLC (GP Holding), which owns 100% of the outstanding equity interests in Blueknight Energy Partners G.P., L.L.C. (the General Partner), from BEHI and Charlesbank
in exchange for aggregate cash consideration of $126.9 million. Pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement, the Issuer purchased 6,667,695 Series A Preferred Units from each of BEHI and Charlesbank in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately $95.3 million, after which BEHI and Charlesbank each retained 2,488,789 Series A Preferred Units. Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Ergon (i) contributed to the Issuer nine asphalt terminals it currently owns plus $22.1
million in cash in return for total consideration of approximately $130.9 million, which consists of the issuance of 18,312,968 of Series A Preferred Units to Ergon in a private placement, and (ii) acquired from the Issuer an aggregate of $5.0
million of Common Units for cash in a private placement.  Pursuant to the Purchase, Sale and Co-Investment Agreement (the
Co-Investment Agreement) dated October 21, 2010 between BEHI and Charlesbank and the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of GP Holding dated November 5, 2012 (the GP Holding
LLC Agreement), BEHI and Charlesbank had agreed to act together in certain circumstances in connection with the voting or the disposition of their securities of the Issuer. The Co-Investment Agreement was terminated on October 5,
2016 by BEHI and Charlesbank. The parties agreement to act together under the GP Holding LLC Agreement also terminated on October 5, 2016, the date on which both parties ceased to be a member of GP Holding. As a result, BEHI and
Charlesbank will no longer deemed to be members of a group for the purposes of Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), or be deemed to beneficially own the securities beneficially
owned by the other party.  The descriptions of the Co-Investment Agreement, MIPA, Repurchase Agreement, Contribution Agreement, and GP
Holding LLC Agreement set forth in this Item 3 do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements, which have been filed as Exhibit D, Exhibit F, Exhibit G,
Exhibit H and Exhibit I, respectively, to the Original 13D and are incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4. Purpose of
Transaction.  This Item 4 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 4 of the Original 13D. 
The information set forth in or incorporated by reference in Item 3, Item 5 and Item 6 of this Amendment is incorporated by
reference in its entirety into this Item 4.  The following describes plans or proposals that the Reporting Persons may have with
respect to the matters set forth in Item 4(a)-(j) of Schedule 13D: 




 
(a)
The information with respect to (i) the disposition of Series A Preferred Units set forth in Item 3 of this Amendment, (ii) Ergons acquisition of Series A Preferred Units and Common Units set forth
in Item 3 of this Amendment and (iii) the registration rights request set forth in Item 6 of this Amendment are each hereby incorporated herein.   


 
(b)
The information with respect to the Transactions set forth in Item 3 of this Amendment is hereby incorporated herein.   


 
(d)
Pursuant to the MIPA, the officers, directors and managers of GP Holding and the directors of the General Partner appointed by BEHI or Charlesbank resigned upon the closing of the Transactions on October 5, 2016.
  


 
(f)
The information with respect to the Transactions set forth in Item 3 of this Amendment is hereby incorporated herein. 
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer. 
This Item 5 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 5 of the Original 13D. 
The information contained in rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 on the cover pages of this Amendment and the information set forth or incorporated by
reference in Items 3, 4 and 6 are hereby incorporated by reference.  (a) - (b) The aggregate number and percentage of Common Units
beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons (on the basis of (A) a total of 35,125,202 Series A Preferred Units based on (i) a total of 30,147,624 Series A Preferred Units issued and outstanding as of July 28, 2016, as reported in the
Issuers Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (the 2016 Q2 Form 10-Q) and (ii) the issuance of 18,312,968 Series A Preferred Units by the Issuer on October 5, 2016 to Ergon
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement and the repurchase of 13,335,390 Series A Preferred Units by the Issuer on October 5, 2016 pursuant to the Repurchase Agreement and (B) a total of 40,386,122 Common Units based on (i) 37,049,876
Common Units issued and outstanding as of July 28, 2016, as reported in the 2016 Q2 Form 10-Q and (ii) the issuance of 847,457 Common Units by the Issuer on October 5, 2016 to Ergon pursuant to the Contribution Agreement) are as
follows:  (i) Charlesbank is the sole record owner of, and has the sole power to vote and dispose of 2,488,789 (7.1%) Series A
Preferred Units (on an as-converted basis, 2,488,789 (6.2%) Common Units).  (ii) None of Fund VII, Fund VII GP or Charlesbank Capital
directly own any Series A Preferred Units or Common Units. Charlesbank is managed by Fund VII. Fund VII GP is the general partner of Fund VII and Charlesbank Capital is the general partner of Fund VII GP. Accordingly, each of Fund VII, Fund VII GP
and Charlesbank Capital may be deemed to beneficially own, and possess shared voting and dispositive powers with respect to, those shares beneficially owned by Charlesbank, representing 2,488,789 (7.1%) Series A Preferred Units (on an
as-converted basis, 2,488,789 (6.2%) Common Units).  The Reporting Persons disclaim beneficial ownership of the reported securities
except to the extent of their pecuniary interests therein, and this report shall not be deemed an admission that the reporting persons are the beneficial owner of the reported securities for purposes of Section 13(d) or 13(g) of the Act, or for
any other purpose.  (c) There have been no reportable transactions with respect to the Common Units within the last 60 days by the
Reporting Persons.  Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer. 
This Item 6 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 6 of the Original 13D. 
The information set forth or incorporated in Item 3 is hereby incorporated herein by reference. 
Pursuant to Charlesbanks registration rights under the Partnership Agreement, BEHI and Charlesbank have requested that the Issuer
prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not less than six months following the effective date, a shelf registration statement covering the Series A
Preferred Units (and the Common Units that may be issued upon conversion of such Series A Preferred Units) held by each of BEHI and Charlesbank. 
To the Reporting Persons knowledge, there are no other contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships (legal or otherwise)
among the persons named in Item 2 and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer. 


The description of the Partnership Agreement set forth in this Item 6 does not purport to be
complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which has been filed as Exhibit J to the Original 13D, and is incorporated herein by reference.
