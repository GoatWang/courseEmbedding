The Future of Combustion™





























 






Duplex Plug & Play™ provides a simple, pre-engineered, and standardized direct burner replacement solution for traditional refinery heaters where Duplex™ technology can be applied to great benefit. Unlike existing burner solutions, the evolution of Duplex technology into an off-the-shelf product reduces the customized engineering associated with typical retrofits while delivering unparalleled low emissions and the elimination of flame impingement.
The Plug & Play design is ideal for vertical process heaters and can be configured for a variety of gaseous fuels including natural gas, refinery fuels, and field or waste gas.
 

 





This unique “Plug & Play” design can be easily retrofitted to replace existing burners and can be inserted into an existing burner opening even while the heater is operational — on-the-fly and without the need for a costly shutdown.
Duplex Plug & Play™ brings NOx levels to below 5 ppm and eliminates flame impingement on process and shock tubes as well as burner-to burner interaction problems common among typical low-emission burners. Performance is achieved without the use of so-called “staged combustion,” excess air, catalyst, flue gas recirculation or other similar methods for reducing NOx and CO emissions within industrial fired heaters.
 

 




 
It's Clean.Duplex Technology is the simplest solution on the market for reducing NOx to less than 5ppm while improving all other critical performance factors.
 



 
It's Efficient.Unlike traditional burner technology, Duplex is the only combustion solution that improves system efficiency.
 



 
It's low cost.Duplex technology is by far the lowest-cost method of reducing emissions from combustion sources. It comprises a simple retrofit. Let us install the Duplex system solution.
 




 Duplex™ technology offers SCR-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
 









 



California Dreaming


Joe Colannino and Roberto Ruiz, ClearSign Combustion, USA, introduce an innovative piece of technology that was able to help a Californian refinery reduce its NOX emissions in the July 2017 issue of Hydrocarbon Engineering.
Click here to read the entire article.
 

 



















Be sure not to miss this issue of Oil&Gas Journal (Mar. 6, 2017 Volume 115.3). Dr. Roberto Ruiz and Dr. Donald Kendrick publish the findings of Clearsign’s breakthrough Duplex™ technology over a 6-week evaluation period at a California refinery. Click the image above or here to view the entire article.








 

 




A simple, innovative approach to combustion systems.
 




How do we do it?
 











The secret of Duplex Technology lies in the thousands of small chambers that make up a Duplex tile. Each holds a tiny flame burning with far more efficiency than a single large flame.


 










The result is a more efficient radiant heat profile that eases stress on burner parts while improving combustion efficiency and increasing maximum throughput potential.


 










The Duplex tiles radiate uniform heat. The roar of the turbulent flame becomes a whisper and harmful gases and particulates are prevented from ever forming in the first place.


 




Duplex is the most capable and beneficial combustion technology on the market.
 









 





A typical burner configuration produces a turbulent cloud of fire. Inside the flame cloud, the mix of oxygen to fuel is inconsistent throughout, resulting in relatively poor combustion and the production of undesirable gases and particulates. Dangerous hotspots can form within the chamber and stress burner parts. It is not uncommon for stressed parts to fail catastrophically and risk injury or death. Repairs can take weeks. Due to this risk, maintenance must be performed frequently. However, each shut-down period is costly in terms of man-power, equipment, and lost productivity.
At ClearSign, we wanted to find a way to reduce criteria emissions while addressing the challenge of cost, inefficiency and maintenance down-time. We did just that. And you’re going to love our solution.
 

 






By contrast, Duplex products improve the air-to-fuel mix by greatly expanding the mixing zone for optimal performance. The combustion that occurs within the Duplex tiles is much more complete. As a result, Duplex technology reduces NOx emissions to levels that meet or beat the most stringent environmental regulations found anywhere in the world.
Since the Duplex technology operates as a black or grey body, heat is radiated more efficiently than a raw flame. Therefore, unlike a typical burner flame, heat is radiated in a manner that will never impinge upon furnace process tubes, resulting in fewer maintenance cycles, fewer outages, and more production. Duplex technology is the first of a series of ClearSign developed platforms that virtually eliminate criteria pollutants while increasing operational efficiency in industrial combustion applications.
 

 








 




 
Reduce pollution.Prevent harmful gases and particulates from ever forming in the first place.
 



 
Reduce Maintenance.Easier on your equipment and requires fewer maintenance cycles.
 



 
Improve performance.Eliminate costly downstream equipment that cuts into your bottom line.
 



 
Return on Investment.Duplex is the only combustion system that pays for itself. Period.

The Future of Combustion™
























Applications
 






ClearSign’s technologies can be applied to virtually any system in which there is a flame. Our solutions enable cost-effective retrofitting onto existing, standard system designs to simultaneously improve both their energy efficiency and pollution control characteristics. ECC™ and/or Duplex™ Technologies offer clear and measurable advantages relative to competing technologies and address unmet market needs across each industrial combustion market:
 

 




Duplex™ for Refinery Process Heaters


Environmental regulations for the refining industry are getting tighter and more difficult to achieve without compromising operations.  The implementation of environmental controls, either at the combustion source or post-combustion, have many undesirable limitations that impose considerable economic costs, primarily related to the reduction in nominal furnace capacity. ClearSign has calculated that potential gains in refinery profitability could be $12 – $28 million per year for an average 100,000 bpd refinery could be achieved by eliminating the bottlenecks caused by conventional NOx control technology in crude heaters alone.

Duplex™ for Steam Generation


ClearSign estimates there are 34,000 large commercial and industrial firetube boilers installed in the US alone today, averaging 21 MMBtu/h each — some 60% of which are located in air quality ‘non-attainment’ regions. Many of these systems in non-attainment regions are required to emit no more than 9PPM of NOx with other regions requiring no more than 5PPM (with the rest of the country expected to follow). To reach 9ppm NOx today, these systems must be modified with a combination of Ultra-Low NOx burners (ULNBs), External Flue Gas Recirculation (EFGR) and systems to control and monitor their performance. To reach 5ppm, either the entire boiler burner system needs to be replaced, or a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system must be added. The 5-year cost of ownership of these SCR systems ranges from between $300,000 to over $600,000 for each of the tens of thousands of boilers impacted.

The Future of Combustion™
























Environmental Landscape
 






We believe that operators in all of our target markets are under intense pressure to meet current and proposed federal, state and local emissions standards.  As a result, we believe that these standards are a significant driver in our development and sales efforts and that our Duplex technology can provide a unique, cost-effective pollution control solution for operators in comparison to competing products.
Emissions standards largely emanate from the Clean Air Act, which is administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and regulates six common criteria air pollutants, including ground-level ozone. These regulations are enforced by state and local air quality districts as part of their compliance plans. As a precursor to ground-level ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are regulated emissions by local air quality districts in order to achieve the EPA limits. The 8-hour ground-level ozone regulations have been reduced from 84 parts per billion (ppb) in 1997, to 75 ppb in 2008, and 70 ppb in 2015, with the requirement of realizing these levels approximately 25 years following the year of legislation. The areas of non-attainment related to this 1997 limit of 84 ppb are depicted below in the map on the left and the projected areas of non-attainment related to the 2015 limit of 70 ppb are depicted below in the map on the right.

(Source: EPA, August 2016)



 







Projected non-attainment areas under the 2015 limit of 70 ppb
(Source: URS, August 2015)



 






We have noted that local air quality districts in severe non-attainment zones in California are uncertain as to how they will achieve the 2015 standard. As such, we believe that local regulators are in search of additional means beyond those included in the current regulations to comply with the impending standards. For example, although NOx emissions from refineries and other oil production and processing operations are highly regulated since they are historically a significant source of stationary NOx emissions, enclosed ground flares have not historically been viewed as a source requiring the same level of regulation. We believe that our Duplex technology is uniquely able to address the emissions challenges being faced by oil producers and other industries as those challenges relate to both current and reasonably predictable future local air emission standards.

Products[edit]




The offices of ClearSign Combustion pictured in 2015


ClearSign develops technology intended to increase energy efficiency and emissions standards of combustion systems, primarily industrial and commercial boilers and furnaces.[2] Its products include Duplex Burner Architecture, which the company says reduces combustion burner flame length by more than 80-percent, in turn increasing thermal capacity and reducing operating costs. Duplex Burner Architecture won the "New Technology Development of the Year Award" at the 2014 West Coast Oil & Gas Awards.[3] The company's other major product is Electrodynamic Combustion Control, which uses computer-controlled electric fields to control the flame shape in boilers, kilns, and furnaces, preventing pollution from forming.[4][5]
History[edit]
ClearSign was formed in Seattle, Washington in 2008. Its first chief executive officer was Richard Rutkowski, who also became chairman of the board of directors. Rutkowski was a co-founder of projection technology company Microvision and nanotechnology company Lumera.[6]
In 2012 ClearSign held an initial public offering which, according to the company, raised $13.8 million.[7] ClearSign chose to delay adopting accounting standards required of publicly traded companies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, taking advantage of exemptions in the JOBS Act designed to make it cheaper for development-stage companies to raise capital.[8] It is believed ClearSign may have been the first company in the U.S. to do so.[9][10]
In December 2014, Rutkowski resigned as CEO. He was replaced by board member Stephen Primat.[2] The following September, the company was named "Technology Company of the Year" by Petroleum Economist.[11]

ClearSign Combustion Corp. has launched a new burner product based on its Duplex™ technology for refinery and industrial process heater applications. 
The Duplex Plug & Play design provides a simple, pre-engineered and standardised direct burner replacement for traditional refinery heaters with the features of ClearSign's unique Duplex technology. The evolution of this technology into an off-the-shelf product reduces the customised engineering associated with typical retrofits while delivering unparalleled low emissions and the elimination of flame impingement. Globally, flame impingement has been a challenge that virtually all refineries and industrial combustion users face, costing many hundreds of millions of dollars annually in lost production, unsafe conditions, and maintenance costs.The product derives its name from the fact that the installation does not require a heater or furnace to be shut down. Rather, the heater can continue to operate while the Duplex Plug & Play is installed through the burner mounting point, connected to the utilities, and turned on. The ability to install the Duplex Plug & Play while the system is operational allows customers to avoid costly downtime.Stephen Pirnat, Chairman and CEO of ClearSign, said: “Our Duplex research and development team, working with customers, have set a new industry standard by capturing the features that refineries desire, literally all over the world. We are excited to deliver and install the first units within the next 60 days to a customer in Texas for field testing. Pending favourable field results, we anticipate interest from a number of OEMs for licensing and potential manufacturing arrangements."Prior to introduction, the Duplex Plug & Play was subjected to months of rigorous laboratory testing that mimicked refinery operating conditions expected to be experienced during the field test. Field testing at the refinery in Texas, US, will provide the last phase of product validation and allows for operational feedback from our beta site customer. The customer has expressed interest in purchasing a number of systems once the testing is completed.

SEATTLE, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ClearSign Combustion Corporation (NASDAQ:   CLIR), a leading provider of industrial combustion technologies that help to reduce emissions and improve efficiency, announced that they have a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with one of China's largest providers of residential and commercial heating services to run a pilot test with the goal of demonstrating ClearSign's Duplex technology as a candidate to achieve ultra-low emissions levels in their boilers. 








Under the terms of the agreement, the state owned enterprise (SOE) agreed to work with ClearSign to install, and demonstrate ClearSign's innovative Duplex™ technology in one of their boilers.  The parties recently singled out specific classes of boilers for testing and demonstration of ClearSign's Duplex technology. The project will be a joint collaboration with ClearSign handling the design, fabrication and overseeing the installation by the local partner.  Upon successful completion of the pilot with results within agreed upon specifications, the parties have agreed to negotiate a subsequent definitive agreement to retro-fit multiple boilers within the district's operational footprint.  
"We are pleased and excited to announce our first Duplex project in China, a market with an obvious need for our products. We believe this Group is a natural partner to validate and then broadly utilize our technology.  We are looking forward to demonstrating our technology and creating a long and mutually beneficial business relationship with them," said Stephen Pirnat, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ClearSign. "Our new partner has hundreds of boilers which would benefit from the use of ClearSign's technology to reduce emissions and enhance their operating efficiency," said Mr. Pirnat.
About ClearSign Combustion Corporation ClearSign Combustion Corporation designs and develops products and technologies for the purpose of improving key performance characteristics of combustion systems, including emissions and operational performance, energy efficiency and overall cost-effectiveness.

The Future of Combustion™





























 






Duplex Plug & Play™ provides a simple, pre-engineered, and standardized direct burner replacement solution for traditional refinery heaters where Duplex™ technology can be applied to great benefit. Unlike existing burner solutions, the evolution of Duplex technology into an off-the-shelf product reduces the customized engineering associated with typical retrofits while delivering unparalleled low emissions and the elimination of flame impingement.
The Plug & Play design is ideal for vertical process heaters and can be configured for a variety of gaseous fuels including natural gas, refinery fuels, and field or waste gas.
 

 





This unique “Plug & Play” design can be easily retrofitted to replace existing burners and can be inserted into an existing burner opening even while the heater is operational — on-the-fly and without the need for a costly shutdown.
Duplex Plug & Play™ brings NOx levels to below 5 ppm and eliminates flame impingement on process and shock tubes as well as burner-to burner interaction problems common among typical low-emission burners. Performance is achieved without the use of so-called “staged combustion,” excess air, catalyst, flue gas recirculation or other similar methods for reducing NOx and CO emissions within industrial fired heaters.
 

 




 
It's Clean.Duplex Technology is the simplest solution on the market for reducing NOx to less than 5ppm while improving all other critical performance factors.
 



 
It's Efficient.Unlike traditional burner technology, Duplex is the only combustion solution that improves system efficiency.
 



 
It's low cost.Duplex technology is by far the lowest-cost method of reducing emissions from combustion sources. It comprises a simple retrofit. Let us install the Duplex system solution.
 




 Duplex™ technology offers SCR-level performance at a fraction of the cost.
 









 



California Dreaming


Joe Colannino and Roberto Ruiz, ClearSign Combustion, USA, introduce an innovative piece of technology that was able to help a Californian refinery reduce its NOX emissions in the July 2017 issue of Hydrocarbon Engineering.
Click here to read the entire article.
 

 



















Be sure not to miss this issue of Oil&Gas Journal (Mar. 6, 2017 Volume 115.3). Dr. Roberto Ruiz and Dr. Donald Kendrick publish the findings of Clearsign’s breakthrough Duplex™ technology over a 6-week evaluation period at a California refinery. Click the image above or here to view the entire article.








 

 




A simple, innovative approach to combustion systems.
 




How do we do it?
 











The secret of Duplex Technology lies in the thousands of small chambers that make up a Duplex tile. Each holds a tiny flame burning with far more efficiency than a single large flame.


 










The result is a more efficient radiant heat profile that eases stress on burner parts while improving combustion efficiency and increasing maximum throughput potential.


 










The Duplex tiles radiate uniform heat. The roar of the turbulent flame becomes a whisper and harmful gases and particulates are prevented from ever forming in the first place.


 




Duplex is the most capable and beneficial combustion technology on the market.
 









 





A typical burner configuration produces a turbulent cloud of fire. Inside the flame cloud, the mix of oxygen to fuel is inconsistent throughout, resulting in relatively poor combustion and the production of undesirable gases and particulates. Dangerous hotspots can form within the chamber and stress burner parts. It is not uncommon for stressed parts to fail catastrophically and risk injury or death. Repairs can take weeks. Due to this risk, maintenance must be performed frequently. However, each shut-down period is costly in terms of man-power, equipment, and lost productivity.
At ClearSign, we wanted to find a way to reduce criteria emissions while addressing the challenge of cost, inefficiency and maintenance down-time. We did just that. And you’re going to love our solution.
 

 






By contrast, Duplex products improve the air-to-fuel mix by greatly expanding the mixing zone for optimal performance. The combustion that occurs within the Duplex tiles is much more complete. As a result, Duplex technology reduces NOx emissions to levels that meet or beat the most stringent environmental regulations found anywhere in the world.
Since the Duplex technology operates as a black or grey body, heat is radiated more efficiently than a raw flame. Therefore, unlike a typical burner flame, heat is radiated in a manner that will never impinge upon furnace process tubes, resulting in fewer maintenance cycles, fewer outages, and more production. Duplex technology is the first of a series of ClearSign developed platforms that virtually eliminate criteria pollutants while increasing operational efficiency in industrial combustion applications.
 

 








 




 
Reduce pollution.Prevent harmful gases and particulates from ever forming in the first place.
 



 
Reduce Maintenance.Easier on your equipment and requires fewer maintenance cycles.
 



 
Improve performance.Eliminate costly downstream equipment that cuts into your bottom line.
 



 
Return on Investment.Duplex is the only combustion system that pays for itself. Period.
