Our Clients


As the investment marketplace has become dramatically more complex, we offer individuals, families and institutions a robust selection of investment management solutions.
Experienced
We design, implement and oversee our clients’ fixed income, equity and alternative investment portfolios on a fee-only basis, as well as address their requirements for financial planning and transition strategies.
Why “Fee-Only” Wealth Management?
At Frontier, we receive a fee that’s based on how well your investment has done. Since our goal is the same as yours, we are in effect sitting on the same side of the table as you are. Transaction-based brokers, on the other hand, make their living by earning commissions on what they sell regardless of how well an investment performs.
Relax and explore
Frontier clients quickly come to rely upon us to advocate for their investment interests, while providing a high degree of fiduciary peace-of-mind.
We address each unique situation with empathy, responsiveness and discretion while conducting our business with the highest degree of professionalism.

Estate Strategies


Frontier will work with you to evaluate the impact of estate implications, as well as prioritize optimal outcomes for a variety of later-in-life scenarios based on a wide variety of family needs, including:

Wills and probate
Survivor planning
Revocable and irrevocable trusts
Family gifting strategies during life or at death
Incapacity planning

Sharing Your Wealth
Frontier can also introduce you to the benefits of Private or Community Foundations, Charitable Remainder Trusts, Donor-Advised Funds or Gift Annuities. We’ll show you how to make use of your resources in a tax-efficient way to increase the impact of your altruistic aspirations.
Estate Planning Begins Now
Do not wait until you or your loved one is in the middle of a crisis before beginning the end-of-life planning process. You can always change or update documents after they are established. Not having the necessary documents in the first place, however, can add expense and delay to settling your estate.
While overseeing this process may be your responsibility, you don’t have to undertake it alone.
One of the missions of a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERTM  professional is to quarterback, or lead, the planning effort as part of a team of professionals that are committed to helping you more effectively plan ahead for an end-of-life scenario.
A financial planner can help keep an estate intact, while ensuring that the best interests of a family are well represented. This effort involves a detailed review and analysis of insurance coverage, investments and current estate plan, as well as the minimization or elimination of income and estate taxes, the maximization of cash flow – and much more.

Our Firm - Frontier Capital Management Company

























 
	  
	  
Our Firm 
Frontier
Capital Management Company, LLC is a Boston-based investment management
firm. Founded in 1980, the firm manages $14.3 billion in client assets as of June 30, 2017
in small, small/mid, mid and all cap U.S. equity strategies. These
strategies are managed under a style that is widely defined as “growth
at reasonable valuations.” In 1999, the product line was broadened to
include small cap value. In 2000, Frontier became an affiliate of Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.
(AMG). Under this ownership arrangement, AMG has a majority interest in
Frontier, with the remaining ownership interest held broadly among
Frontier employees. Frontier employees control all of the firm's
management and the investment process.
Our primary
focus and key success factor has been our dedication to internally
generated detailed fundamental research. Through in depth analysis, we
identify companies on a “bottom up” basis that we believe have the
potential to show above average returns for our clients' portfolios.
Our integrated team of 18 investment professionals provides a wide
range of industry coverage and individual company analysis.

Nearly all of the assets at Frontier are managed for institutional
clients. We do not manage any hedge funds or proprietary mutual funds,
allowing for a focused business environment.
 Since
inception, Frontier has grown at a steady, manageable pace. We have a
deep appreciation for the importance of controlled growth at all
levels, placing a priority on long term investment performance. This
allows us to emphasize superior investment performance, while
delivering excellent client service and providing opportunities for our
employees.
