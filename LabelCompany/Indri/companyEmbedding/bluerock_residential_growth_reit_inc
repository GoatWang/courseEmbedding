Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc.






Year:  2016Report Date:  1/24/2017Notes/Supplemental Information: Bluerock Residential Growth REIT, Inc. has Class A Common Stock which was traded under the ticker "BRG". BRG also had one class of common stock "Class B-3" which was restricted and non-tradable and did not have a ticker symbol but did have a CUSIP number.
Classes B-3 was paid dividends during a portion of 2016, same as the Class A Common Stock. We have provided the information in the table with the CUSIP numbers but no ticker symbols.
Series B Preferred Stock is a non-tradable security sold in bi-weekly closings, each closing has a separate CUSIP number and pays a monthly dividend.
This spreadsheet and the accompanying instructions do not constitute, and should not be considered a substitute for, legal advice. The rules governing the proper tax characterization of distributions by REITs can be complex. Each REIT should consult its own tax advisor regarding the proper tax characterization and reporting of the REIT’s distributions.
