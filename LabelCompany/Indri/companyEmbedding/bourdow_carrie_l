Trevena Appoints Carrie Bourdow as Chief Commercial Officer5/4/15
Trevena, Inc. (NASDAQ: TRVN), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of biased ligands targeting G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), today announced the appointment of Carrie L. Bourdow as senior vice president and chief commercial officer, effective immediately.
“Carrie has a fantastic track record of leading successful commercial strategies, and brings a wealth of experience in a wide range of therapy areas, including neurology and hospital acute care,” said Maxine Gowen, Ph.D., chief executive officer. “Her expertise will be invaluable as we advance our growing portfolio and build our company for long-term success.” 
“I am excited to join the Trevena team as the company progresses towards commercializing intravenous TRV130 for acute moderate to severe pain,” said Ms. Bourdow. “The company’s novel research has generated a diverse therapeutic platform and I look forward to providing commercial insight and perspective as Trevena develops its Phase 3 programs.” 
Ms. Bourdow brings over 25 years of experience in pharmaceutical sales and marketing. Most recently, she was vice president of marketing, reimbursement, and operations at Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where she led launch strategy, marketing, reimbursement, and operations for five acute care hospital pharmaceuticals totaling over $1 billion in annual revenues. Prior to joining Cubist in 2013, Ms. Bourdow served for more than 20 years at Merck & Co., Inc., where she held positions of increasing responsibility across several therapeutic areas including anti-infectives, acute heart failure, and pain. Ms. Bourdow has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Hendrix College and earned her Masters in Business Administration from Southern Illinois University. 
About Trevena 
Trevena, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and intends to commercialize therapeutics that use a novel approach to target G protein coupled receptors, or GPCRs. Using its proprietary product platform, Trevena is developing four biased ligand product candidates it has identified - TRV027 to treat acute heart failure (Phase 2b), TRV130 to treat moderate to severe acute pain intravenously (Phase 2b), TRV734 to treat moderate to severe acute and chronic pain orally (Phase 1), and TRV250 for treatment-refractory migraine and other CNS disorders (preclinical). 
Cautionary Note on Forward Looking Statements 
Any statements in this press release about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, including statements about the company’s strategy, future operations, clinical development of its therapeutic candidates, plans for potential future product candidates and other statements containing the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “predict,” “project,” “suggest,” “target,” “potential,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “should,” “continue,” and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including: the status, timing, costs, results and interpretation of the company’s clinical trials; the uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials; whether interim results from a clinical trial will be predictive of the final results of the trial or results of early clinical trials will be indicative of the results of future trials; expectations for regulatory approvals; availability of funding sufficient for the company’s foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; other matters that could affect the viability or commercial potential of the company’s therapeutic candidates; the inherent uncertainties associated with intellectual property; and other factors discussed in the Risk Factors set forth in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in other filings the company makes with the SEC from time to time. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this press release represent the company’s views only as of the date hereof. The company anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause the company’s views to change. However, while the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, except as may be required by law.
