2. The reporting person is filing this amendment to correct an error with respect to the amount of securities deemed to have been cancelled pursuant to the transaction described in footnote (1), which in turn resulted in an error in the amount of securities reported as beneficially owned in subsequent reported transactions.

3. Represents time-based RSU awards that will vest in three equal annual installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of October 1, 2015, subject to the Reporting Person's continued employment with the Company.

4. Represents time-based RSUs that vests 100% on the third anniversary date from the date of grant.
