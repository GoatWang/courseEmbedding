Testimonials


 




"the signature style here ... runs all the way from the brilliant energy they gift to the room through to the apposite design of the new bedrooms in the lodge ...a little piece of heaven."


John McKenna ~ author of The Bridgestone Guides

"A symphony of "Victorian Contemporary Fusion" with Arts & Crafts stained glass, bordello brocades, spray-painted silver furnishings, and lordly antiques, this unique hotel in an old Victorian building is a racy addition to the sometimes staid Dublin scene. The restaurant continues the over-the-top decor with a lavish 1940s glam look."


Fodor's Travel  ~ Review

"A wide open shell was cleverly transformed into space that utilises the cafe to its optimum productivity, while quite literally becoming a home away from home for many hungry customers. Warm, bright, cosy, comfortable, stylish, rustic chic are all terms people who have kindly visited the cafe to date have often used in very complimentary terms."


Audrey McDonald ~ Proprietor

During 2012, BBC Radio 3's Choral Evensong will feature anthems from this collection and a specially bound copy will be presented to HM The Queen. Featured composers include John Tavener, John Rutter, Judith Weir, Roxanna Panufnik, Judith Bingham, Richard Rodney Bennett, Peter Maxwell Davies and others.
