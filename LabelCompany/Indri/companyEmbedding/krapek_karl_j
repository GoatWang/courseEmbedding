Krapek To Re Tire From Utc - tribunedigital-thecourant







 


 Home→Collections→UtcKrapek To Re Tire From UtcSurprise Decision By Second In Command Raises Succession QuestionsJanuary 12, 2002|By BARBARA NAGY And MICHAEL REMEZ; Courant Staff Writers Staff Writer Kenneth R. Gosselin contributed to this report.Karl J. Krapek, the executive who rebuilt United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney division and was expected to succeed George David as UTC chairman, is abruptly leaving the company.Krapek, 53, will retire at the end of this month as UTC's second in command -- president and chief operating officer.He apparently has no other job lined up. The sudden announcement stunned employees, community leaders and even some of Krapek's friends."I have come to a time in my life where other priorities are important to me and my family," the one-time General Motors Corp. manager said in a brief press release issued by UTC after the stock markets closed late Friday.David, Krapek's mentor during his 20-year rise through the company, said he will miss Krapek's energy, experience and counsel.Neither was available for comment late Friday."No one knew this was coming," said one manager at Pratt's East Hartford headquarters, where executives were called together at 4:30 p.m. to hear the news. "There was not a rumble."The announcement led to speculation that David and Krapek, both known as energetic, take-charge executives, were not getting along. The release contained just five paragraphs, three of them about Krapek. The fourth reaffirmed Wall Street's estimates of UTC's fourth-quarter profits, scheduled to be released next Thursday, and the last paragraph contained background about the company.But Krapek, who travels frequently and faces lengthy days at work, has long lamented to friends about his lack of time with family. Krapek has held top civic positions -- most notably in the redevelopment of downtown Hartford -- and seemed to enjoy the work. But he had to cut back on commitments after moving from Pratt to his corporate post.Analysts expect UTC stock to suffer Monday when trading resumes, but they said David will have plenty of time to find another successor. They said they wouldn't be surprised if Krapek is quickly hired by another company or even has something else already lined up."It always hurts when you lose a top person," said Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research in Newport, R.I. But he added David was not expected to retire soon and should have no trouble resuming control of day-to-day operations until a successor to Krapek can be found."I'm not going to change any earnings estimates or anything like that because of it," Nisbet said.People familiar with UTC, the state's largest industrial employer, have long wondered whether Krapek would be content playing a supporting role at the company for another five years -- assuming David didn't retire until he was 65. Krapek once said his favorite job was running Pontiac's Fiero assembly line at GM 25 years ago, because he had near-total control -- and responsibility -- for the operation.Wall Street analysts recently had suggested Krapek as a candidate to head Honeywell International Inc., a company David tried unsuccessfully to woo into a merger 18 months ago. A year ago, Krapek was also mentioned as a possible candidate for an executive post at the Boeing Co.Krapek was raised in Osage, Iowa. He has said his father, a dentist, gave him the drive to excel. A young Karl Krapek worked his way up through GM before being hired as a vice president at UTC's Otis Elevator Co.When David needed someone with manufacturing expertise to run UTC's troubled Pratt division in 1992, he turned to Krapek.Krapek and a handful of trusted deputies used new efficient-production techniques developed by Toyota Motor Corp. in Japan to transform the jet-engine company into a lean operation. They eliminated thousands of jobs and forced Pratt's suppliers to cut costs, steps that won Krapek the disdain of many workers.But industry observers say that without the changes, the company would not have survived. Analysts had hoped Krapek would do the same with UTC's other divisions over the years.Today, Pratt is producing record profits and is spending hundreds of millions to develop new engines that it hopes will get it back in the growing market for smaller aircraft."You have to credit Karl Krapek with positioning the company to take advantage of that," Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, said when Krapek left Pratt in 1999. "Clearly that didn't come without pain and a lot of that pain [was] due directly to people being laid off."With success, Krapek has won national media attention and praise from Wall Street. Executives at UTC have worried that Krapek might be lured by a corporate talent-hunter to jump to another company. In 1998, as an incentive to stay, they gave Krapek a position on the board of directors and lucrative stock incentives."I don't know how they're going to replace Karl," said consultant Mark Bobbi. "That's not good news for UTC."It wasn't immediately clear Friday how his departure would affect those incentives.1 | 2 |  Next
