Linda Cook (business)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from Linda Z. Cook)

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Linda Zarda Cook (born June 4, 1958) is an American businesswoman. She rose to be CEO of Shell Gas & Power, part of Royal Dutch Shell, in the Netherlands. Cook was named the 11th most powerful businesswoman in the world by Fortune magazine in October 2002 and the 44th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine in September 2007.
Cook, raised in Shawnee, Kansas, graduated from the University of Kansas in petroleum engineering in 1980. She began her Shell career in 1980 as a reservoir engineer in the United States, advancing through the company to accept greater responsibilities in exploration and production with Shell U.S.A. Her first European assignment came in 1998, when she and her family moved to the Netherlands, where she led Shell International EP. She has led the Gas & Power division since January 2000. Cook is also member of board of directors of KBR (company) and The Boeing Company.
Following a loss in the race to become the company's next Chief Executive,[1] Cook is to step down from her position in Royal Dutch Shell, forgoing a loyalty bonus of more than £800,000. Shortly following the announcement of her resignation was the news that her division, Gas and Power, would be absorbed into the new management structure being promoted by new Chief Executive Peter Voser.[2] Shares in Shell fell 1.1 per cent or 18p to 1613p in morning trading.
A Shell spokesman said the resignation was by mutual agreement.[3] Cook, who since 2004 has been in charge of the group’s gas and power division, responsible for natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and Shell’s power generation operations, had worked for Shell for 29 years. Cook's severance pay comes to about 5.4 million euros, a figure determined by standard company and legal guidelines.[4]
On March 16, 2015 it was announced that Cook would not seek reelection to Boeing's board of directors.[5]

Linda Z. Cook Elected to Marathon Oil Corporation Board of Directors
HOUSTON, July 5, 2011 - Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) announced today that Linda Z. Cook has been elected to the Company's board of directors, effective July 1, 2011.   Cook, whose career in the oil and gas industry spanned 29 years, retired in 2009 from Royal Dutch Shell PLC where she was a member of the executive committee and the board of directors, serving as executive director of Shell Gas and Power based in Den Haag, Netherlands.      "Marathon is delighted to welcome Linda Cook to Marathon Oil's board of directors," said Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr., chairman, president and CEO.  "Linda's extensive global experience in oil and gas exploration and production, her keen business insights and knowledge of other key elements of the upstream business, and her proven track record as a leader make her an outstanding addition to the Marathon Oil board."   As executive director of Shell Gas and Power from 2004 to mid-2009, Cook was responsible for Shell's global natural gas and power business including liquefied natural gas, major natural gas transport activities, as well as gas to liquids and clean coal technology.  Her other responsibilities included Shell Trading, Shell Renewable Energy, Global Solutions and Shell Technology, in addition to regional oversight for Shell's activities in East Asia and Australia.   From 2003 to 2004, Cook served as president and chief executive officer and a member of the board of directors of Shell Canada Ltd., in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, one of Canada's largest publicly traded integrated oil companies at the time and a leader in natural gas exploration and production, oil refining and marketing, and oil sands mining and upgrading.  Prior to that, from 2000 to 2003, she served as chief executive officer of Shell Gas and Power in London, U.K.; and from mid-1998 through 1999, as managing director, International Ventures of Shell Exploration & Production Company in Den Haag, Netherlands.     Cook served as general manager, New Business Development of Shell Exploration & Production Company in Houston, Texas from 1997 to 1998; and she also held various other production management and engineering positions within Shell Exploration & Production Company from 1980 to 1997.   Cook, 53, is a 1980 graduate of the University of Kansas with a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering.  She serves on the boards of The Boeing Company, the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems; and Cargill, Inc., an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial and industrial products and services.  She was recently elected to the board of directors of KBR, Inc., one of the world's leading engineering, procurement and construction companies.
