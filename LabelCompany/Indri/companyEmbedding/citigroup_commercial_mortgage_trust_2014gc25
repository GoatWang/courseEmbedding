                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2014-GC25 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2014-GC25
    





October 06, 2016 03:39 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust (CGCMT) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 
      2014-GC25. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of CGCMT 2014-GC25 are based on the stable performance 
      of the underlying collateral since issuance. As of the September 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 0.91% to $834.3 million from $842 million at issuance. The 
      pool has experienced no realized losses to date. De minimis interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting the non-rated class G. There are 
      currently no delinquent or specially serviced loans, and no loans are 
      defeased. Four loans are currently on the servicers watch list (5.74%).
    

      The largest loan on the servicers watch list is the Denver Merchandise 
      Mart (3.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 810,000 square foot (sf) 
      wholesale trade mart and exhibition hall located in Denver, CO. The 
      property went on the servicer's watchlist after incurring damage from a 
      hail storm in June 2015. A roof replacement was required as a result, 
      and insurance proceeds have been reserved to complete the repairs.
    

      Repair work began in February 2016, with phase I completed. According to 
      the servicer, phase II repairs on the Mart Expansion section of the 
      building were scheduled to be complete in July 2016, with a third phase 
      to begin thereafter on the Mart and Upper Mart sections. Based on 
      servicer reporting, property operations appear to remain stable. The net 
      operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported at 
      1.89x at year-end (YE) 2015, compared to 1.96x at issuance. The interim 
      year-to-date (YTD) June 2015 DSCR was higher at 2.56x given the partial 
      year operations reflecting lower expenses (utilities, marketing, 
      payroll, and R&M) for the first half of the year. The servicer reported 
      occupancy is 86% as of June 2016, and was 92% at YE 2015.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (13.2%) is secured by Bank of America 
      Plaza, a 1.4 million sf office building located in downtown Los Angeles. 
      Occupancy has averaged above 90% over the past 10 years, reporting at 
      92% occupancy per the June 2016 rent roll. Since issuance, the largest 
      tenant, The Capital Group Companies (22.6% of the net rentable area 
      [NRA]), extended its lease for an additional 15 years to February 2033 
      from its original expiration in February 2018. Other major tenants 
      include Shepard, Mullin, Richter, & Hampton LLC (13.0% of NRA) and Bank 
      of America (rated 'A'; 11.4% of NRA), with lease expirations in December 
      2024 and June 2022, respectively.
    

      Property NOI has improved since issuance, with the YE 2015 NOI reporting 
      an 8.2% increase over YE 2014, and 21% over the trailing-twelve-month 
      (TTM) June 2014 provided at issuance. The NOI improvement is primarily 
      driven by increased revenues from lease rent steps, plus an increase in 
      other income since issuance. The YTD June 2016 DSCR reported at 2.74x, 
      compared to 2.45x and 2.27x at YE 2015 and YE 2014, respectively.
    

      The second largest set of loans in the pool (7.3% of the pool) consists 
      of five cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans secured by five 
      anchored or unanchored retail properties located in CA, ND, or CO. 
      Anchors include Office Depot, Stater Bros, Sears, Chuck E. Cheese, 
      Trader Joes, and King Soopers. The properties across the portfolio have 
      experienced stable operations since issuance. As of June 2016, the 
      combined occupancy for the five properties reported at 92% with NOI DSCR 
      at 2.11x. The largest of the loans is the $20 million Orange Plaza 
      Shopping Center loan (2.4% of the pool), secured by a 132,000 sf 
      shopping center in Redlands, CA. The property is 99% occupied and is 
      anchored by Rite Aid (29% NRA) and Trader Joes (15% NRA) and shadow 
      anchored by Vons grocery store.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks remain Stable for all classes due to stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. Fitch does not foresee positive 
      or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC25' (Jul. 28, 2015), 
      available at www.fitchratings.com.

      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the

      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating

      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust (CGCMT) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 
      2014-GC25. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of CGCMT 2014-GC25 are based on the stable performance 
      of the underlying collateral since issuance. As of the September 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 0.91% to $834.3 million from $842 million at issuance. The 
      pool has experienced no realized losses to date. De minimis interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting the non-rated class G. There are 
      currently no delinquent or specially serviced loans, and no loans are 
      defeased. Four loans are currently on the servicers watch list (5.74%).
    

      The largest loan on the servicers watch list is the Denver Merchandise 
      Mart (3.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 810,000 square foot (sf) 
      wholesale trade mart and exhibition hall located in Denver, CO. The 
      property went on the servicer's watchlist after incurring damage from a 
      hail storm in June 2015. A roof replacement was required as a result, 
      and insurance proceeds have been reserved to complete the repairs.
    

      Repair work began in February 2016, with phase I completed. According to 
      the servicer, phase II repairs on the Mart Expansion section of the 
      building were scheduled to be complete in July 2016, with a third phase 
      to begin thereafter on the Mart and Upper Mart sections. Based on 
      servicer reporting, property operations appear to remain stable. The net 
      operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported at 
      1.89x at year-end (YE) 2015, compared to 1.96x at issuance. The interim 
      year-to-date (YTD) June 2015 DSCR was higher at 2.56x given the partial 
      year operations reflecting lower expenses (utilities, marketing, 
      payroll, and R&M) for the first half of the year. The servicer reported 
      occupancy is 86% as of June 2016, and was 92% at YE 2015.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (13.2%) is secured by Bank of America 
      Plaza, a 1.4 million sf office building located in downtown Los Angeles. 
      Occupancy has averaged above 90% over the past 10 years, reporting at 
      92% occupancy per the June 2016 rent roll. Since issuance, the largest 
      tenant, The Capital Group Companies (22.6% of the net rentable area 
      [NRA]), extended its lease for an additional 15 years to February 2033 
      from its original expiration in February 2018. Other major tenants 
      include Shepard, Mullin, Richter, & Hampton LLC (13.0% of NRA) and Bank 
      of America (rated 'A'; 11.4% of NRA), with lease expirations in December 
      2024 and June 2022, respectively.
    

      Property NOI has improved since issuance, with the YE 2015 NOI reporting 
      an 8.2% increase over YE 2014, and 21% over the trailing-twelve-month 
      (TTM) June 2014 provided at issuance. The NOI improvement is primarily 
      driven by increased revenues from lease rent steps, plus an increase in 
      other income since issuance. The YTD June 2016 DSCR reported at 2.74x, 
      compared to 2.45x and 2.27x at YE 2015 and YE 2014, respectively.
    

      The second largest set of loans in the pool (7.3% of the pool) consists 
      of five cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans secured by five 
      anchored or unanchored retail properties located in CA, ND, or CO. 
      Anchors include Office Depot, Stater Bros, Sears, Chuck E. Cheese, 
      Trader Joes, and King Soopers. The properties across the portfolio have 
      experienced stable operations since issuance. As of June 2016, the 
      combined occupancy for the five properties reported at 92% with NOI DSCR 
      at 2.11x. The largest of the loans is the $20 million Orange Plaza 
      Shopping Center loan (2.4% of the pool), secured by a 132,000 sf 
      shopping center in Redlands, CA. The property is 99% occupied and is 
      anchored by Rite Aid (29% NRA) and Trader Joes (15% NRA) and shadow 
      anchored by Vons grocery store.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks remain Stable for all classes due to stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. Fitch does not foresee positive 
      or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC25' (Jul. 28, 2015), 
      available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10

      --$40.0 million (a) class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$137.9 million (a) class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      a Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for up to the 
      full certificate principal amount of the class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G, X-D, X-E, X-F, or X-G 
      certificates.

      Fitch to Rate Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC25 Commercial 
      Mtg P-T Certs; Presale Issued
    





October 07, 2014 12:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued its presale report on Citigroup Commercial 
      Mortgage Trust 2014-GC25 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$30,646,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,763,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$235,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$248,803,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65,202,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$634,673,000* class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,626,000* class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,259,000b class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,626,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$137,881,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$39,996,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (*) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (a) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) The class A-S, class B and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B and class C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Oct. 6, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $49,469,000*a class 
      X-D, the $16,840,000*a class X-E, the $17,893,000*a class X-F, the 
      $30,524,109*a class X-G, the $49,469,000a class D, the $16,840,000a 
      class E, the $17,893,000a class F, and the $30,524,109a class G 
      certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 62 loans secured by 99 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $842 million as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Citigroup 
      Global Markets Realty Corp.; MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance 
      LLC; Starwood Mortgage Funding I LLC; Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; 
      RAIT Funding, LLC; GS Commercial Real Estate LP; and SPT CA Fundings, 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 71.8% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 85%, and asset summary reviews of 86.7% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower deals. The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) of 1.13x and 
      110.6%, respectively, are worse than the 2013 and first-half 2014 
      averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 105.6%, respectively.
    

      Pool Concentration: The 10 largest loans represent 59.7% of the total 
      pool balance, and the top three loans represent 27.6% of the total pool 
      balance. The LCI for the pool is 485 and the SCI is 508 - both are 
      higher than recent comparable transactions.
    

      Traditional Property Types: The three largest property types are office 
      (35.6% of pool), retail (26.3%), and multifamily (16.2%). Hospitality 
      represents only 2.7% of the pool, a low concentration for the most 
      volatile property type. For Fitch-rated deals in the first half 2014, 
      office, retail, multifamily, and hotels represented 18.4%, 31.4%, 17.2%, 
      and 13.3%, respectively.
    

      Collateral Quality: As a percent of Fitch inspected properties, 49.5% of 
      the pool received a property quality grade of 'B+' or higher, while only 
      5.1% received a grade below 'B-.' The largest loan in the pool, Bank of 
      America Plaza, received a property quality grade of 'A.'
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 8.5% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      CGCMT 2014-GC25 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 76 -77.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan 
      Services, a Division of PNC Bank, National Association, rated 'CSS1' by 
      Fitch.
    

      The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Fitch Affirms CGCMT 2014-GC25
Tweet


Print



      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of Citigroup Commercial Mortgage 
      Trust (CGCMT) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 
      2014-GC25. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of CGCMT 2014-GC25 are based on the stable performance 
      of the underlying collateral since issuance. As of the September 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 0.91% to $834.3 million from $842 million at issuance. The 
      pool has experienced no realized losses to date. De minimis interest 
      shortfalls are currently affecting the non-rated class G. There are 
      currently no delinquent or specially serviced loans, and no loans are 
      defeased. Four loans are currently on the servicers watch list (5.74%).
    

      The largest loan on the servicers watch list is the Denver Merchandise 
      Mart (3.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 810,000 square foot (sf) 
      wholesale trade mart and exhibition hall located in Denver, CO. The 
      property went on the servicer's watchlist after incurring damage from a 
      hail storm in June 2015. A roof replacement was required as a result, 
      and insurance proceeds have been reserved to complete the repairs.
    

      Repair work began in February 2016, with phase I completed. According to 
      the servicer, phase II repairs on the Mart Expansion section of the 
      building were scheduled to be complete in July 2016, with a third phase 
      to begin thereafter on the Mart and Upper Mart sections. Based on 
      servicer reporting, property operations appear to remain stable. The net 
      operating income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) reported at 
      1.89x at year-end (YE) 2015, compared to 1.96x at issuance. The interim 
      year-to-date (YTD) June 2015 DSCR was higher at 2.56x given the partial 
      year operations reflecting lower expenses (utilities, marketing, 
      payroll, and R&M) for the first half of the year. The servicer reported 
      occupancy is 86% as of June 2016, and was 92% at YE 2015.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (13.2%) is secured by Bank of America 
      Plaza, a 1.4 million sf office building located in downtown Los Angeles. 
      Occupancy has averaged above 90% over the past 10 years, reporting at 
      92% occupancy per the June 2016 rent roll. Since issuance, the largest 
      tenant, The Capital Group Companies (22.6% of the net rentable area 
      [NRA]), extended its lease for an additional 15 years to February 2033 
      from its original expiration in February 2018. Other major tenants 
      include Shepard, Mullin, Richter, & Hampton LLC (13.0% of NRA) and Bank 
      of America (rated 'A'; 11.4% of NRA), with lease expirations in December 
      2024 and June 2022, respectively.
    

      Property NOI has improved since issuance, with the YE 2015 NOI reporting 
      an 8.2% increase over YE 2014, and 21% over the trailing-twelve-month 
      (TTM) June 2014 provided at issuance. The NOI improvement is primarily 
      driven by increased revenues from lease rent steps, plus an increase in 
      other income since issuance. The YTD June 2016 DSCR reported at 2.74x, 
      compared to 2.45x and 2.27x at YE 2015 and YE 2014, respectively.
    

      The second largest set of loans in the pool (7.3% of the pool) consists 
      of five cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loans secured by five 
      anchored or unanchored retail properties located in CA, ND, or CO. 
      Anchors include Office Depot, Stater Bros, Sears, Chuck E. Cheese, 
      Trader Joes, and King Soopers. The properties across the portfolio have 
      experienced stable operations since issuance. As of June 2016, the 
      combined occupancy for the five properties reported at 92% with NOI DSCR 
      at 2.11x. The largest of the loans is the $20 million Orange Plaza 
      Shopping Center loan (2.4% of the pool), secured by a 132,000 sf 
      shopping center in Redlands, CA. The property is 99% occupied and is 
      anchored by Rite Aid (29% NRA) and Trader Joes (15% NRA) and shadow 
      anchored by Vons grocery store.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks remain Stable for all classes due to stable 
      performance of the pool since issuance. Fitch does not foresee positive 
      or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'Citigroup Commercial Mortgage Trust 2014-GC25' (Jul. 28, 2015), 
      available at www.fitchratings.com.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$22.9 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9.8 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$235 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$248.8 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65.2 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$634.7 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52.6 million* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45.3 million (a) class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52.6 million (a) class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40.0 million (a) class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$137.9 million (a) class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      a Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for up to the 
      full certificate principal amount of the class A-S, B and C certificates.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G, X-D, X-E, X-F, or X-G 
      certificates.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

            View Mortgage Licenses and Eligibility












  Terms and Conditions Apply. SOFI RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. To qualify, a borrower must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident in an eligible state and meet SoFi's underwriting requirements. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. To qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. If approved, your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including term of loan, a responsible financial history, years of experience, income and other factors. Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions. SoFi refinance loans are private loans and do not have the same repayment options that the federal loan program offers such as Income Based Repayment or Income Contingent Repayment or PAYE. Licensed by the Department of Business Oversight under the California Finance Lender Law License No. 6054612. SoFi loans are originated by SoFi Lending Corp., NMLS # 1121636. (www.nmlsconsumeraccess.org)


  ✝ To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull.


  1 At the end of 84 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 7/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  2 At the end of 60 months the interest rate and monthly payment for the 5/1 ARM adjusts. At adjustment the new mortgage rate will be the average of the Interbank offered rates for one-year, U.S. dollar-denominated deposits in the London market (LIBOR) as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin of 2.25% subject to annual and lifetime adjustment caps.


  3 SoFi’s interest-only loan is a 30-year, 5/1 ARM loan. During the first 10 interest-only years, the minimum monthly payment required is the interest on the loan. Paying the minimum payment during the interest-only period will not reduce the principal loan balance. At the end of the 10 interest-only years, the minimum payment required will increase, even if the interest rate does not change, to include both interest and principal payments.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
