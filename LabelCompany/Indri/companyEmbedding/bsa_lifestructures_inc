Healing







Our Markets
BSA LifeStructures understands the design of a facility directly affects those who work, learn and heal within the space. From the materials used to the distance between workplaces, and from the location of light switches to the orientation of an entire building, these factors from the smallest to the largest have an impact on the outcomes within a healing, learning and discovery environment. At BSA LifeStructures we value every aspect of these spaces, creating inspired solutions that improve lives.

BSA LifeStructures – Indianapolis




BSA LifeStructures was founded in Indianapolis in 1975 by an architect and an engineer. Today, the same multidisciplinary approach drives the growth of the firm within the Midwest as well as nationally. The firm’s robust list of clients provides the foundation of design leadership and expertise in the healing, learning and discovery markets. Indianapolis is the perfect central location for connecting expertise with organizations locally and across the country.
As the setting of the first of seven offices, the Indianapolis community is very important to our firm. We are as committed to our local community today as we were in the beginning. The mission of the firm, “creating inspired solutions that change lives,” is the essence of our team.
Located less than a mile from the interstate 465 and keystone avenue intersection, the office is set in a prime and central Indianapolis location.
