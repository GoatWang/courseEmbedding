Advisory firms are ranked by total assets under management.To land on the list, firms had to have a focus on financial and retirement planning for individual and high-net-worth Clients.  Institutional Clients do not make up a substantial portion of their businesses. Finally, none of these firms are owned by a bank, broker/dealer or investment company. The rating may not be representative of any one client’s experience because the rating reflects a quantitative and qualitative analysis of factors that may include only a sample of the experience of CMG’s Clients. The rating is not indicative of future performance.  CMG did not pay a fee to participate in the ranking.Asset ManagementChurchill recommends providing investment choices across three major asset classes. The most basic menu will always include cash equivalents, fixed income, and equities. To further customize your plan to meet the unique needs of your employees, a plan may offer more expanded menus that provide equity strategies that follow various investment styles and objectives.
