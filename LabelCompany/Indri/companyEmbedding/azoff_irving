Biography[edit]
Raised in a Jewish family[4] in Danville, Illinois, Azoff began promoting and booking bands while a student at Danville High School and then in college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He moved to Los Angeles in 1970 with his first client, Dan Fogelberg. He worked for Geffen-Roberts Management and there began working with the Eagles, a relationship that has lasted more than forty years. During his career he has worked as an agent, personal manager, concert promoter, movie producer, independent record label owner, merchandiser, music publisher, and CEO of a record company.[citation needed]
From 1983 to 1989, Azoff was chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group and is credited for turning around that label's fortunes.[5]
According to Thomas R. King's book The Operator (2001), David Geffen manipulated Azoff into leaving MCA and going to Warner Music Group, where Azoff started Giant Records. King writes that Geffen wanted Azoff out at MCA to clear the way for MCA to buy Geffen Records.[6] Geffen convinced Mo Ostin at Warner Music to offer Irving Azoff a "dream" label deal. Giant Records operated for much of the 1990s until Azoff decided to return to concentrating on artist management.[citation needed]
Azoff co-produced the movies Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Urban Cowboy, Jack Frost (1998 film), Above The Rim, and The Inkwell, and was executive producer of The Hurricane.[7] He has been named "Manager of the Year" by two touring industry trade publications. In 2012, Azoff appeared in Artifact, a documentary film about the modern music business focused on the legal battle between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI.[citation needed] In 2015, he played a thinly veiled version of himself in the Documentary Now! parody of History of the Eagles.[8]
Business developments[edit]
In October 2008, ticketing and marketing company Ticketmaster announced they would acquire the management company Front Line Management Group, Inc. As part of the deal, Azoff, who was founder and chief executive officer of Front Line, became chief executive officer of Ticketmaster and was named chairman of Live Nation in February 2011.[2]
In September 2013, Azoff unveiled Azoff MSG Entertainment, a venture with The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG).[9] In addition to his role as chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment, Azoff would serve as a consultant to MSG in connection with the management of its live event venues, including the Forum in Inglewood, CA and other MSG-managed buildings.[10]
In 2012, he topped Billboard Magazine's Power 100, being named the most powerful person in the music industry.[11] Azoff serves on the boards of iHeartCommunications, Inc. and Starz LLC.

LOS ANGELES — In the music business, an artist’s personal manager is usually a behind-the-scenes figure, the negotiator and taskmaster unseen by the general public.And then there is Irving Azoff, the bombastic super-manager of the Eagles, Steely Dan, Van Halen, Christina Aguilera and other stars, who made his reputation in the 1970s by securing top-dollar deals for his clients. His behavior was so outrageous that Rolling Stone sent Cameron Crowe to write a profile of him. In one oft-repeated anecdote, he once used a chain saw to cut through a hotel room wall.Those antics are now well behind Mr. Azoff, 68, who on Sunday will be honored with a Salute to Industry Icons award as part of the annual pre-Grammy gala hosted by Clive Davis. But Mr. Azoff — who in addition to his career as a powerful manager is a former chairman of MCA and, more recently, Live Nation — remains one of the music world’s most outspoken figures, capable of igniting the industry with a barbed post on Twitter.On a sunny afternoon this week in his office here, Mr. Azoff, surrounded by memorabilia — including a pair of bobbleheads depicting Mr. Azoff and Joe Walsh of the Eagles — spoke about problems facing the music industry today, the last days of the Eagles’ Glenn Frey, who died in January at 67, and the pride he feels in his son Jeffrey, who recently took over the management of Harry Styles from One Direction. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation. Continue reading the main story

Q. You’ve been named an industry “icon.” What does that mean to you?A. To my knowledge this is the first time they’ve given this award to a manager. It’s always been a sitting record company president or the head of a music publishing company or something. So I thought it was important the Grammys are expanding their definition of icons in the music business.I think we’re at a key crossroads in the business. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, and despite higher consumption of music, the monetization of it has gone to hell. So I’m hoping that this signifies a moment when everybody — labels, publishers, artists, managers — are all in the same boat and can really do something about it.Q. What needs to be done?A. It’s very clear that the economics of streaming haven’t helped creators. And I don’t think that when President Clinton signed the law that led to safe harbor, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that there was any intention for the tech companies to hide behind it the way that they currently do.

None of us in the music business have enough resources to fight the legal battles against these big tech companies. The best thing would be to change laws.Q. After you set up Global Music Rights, your new performing-rights organization, a few years ago, one of the first things you did was go after YouTube.A. When I started G.M.R., I was looking for a business opportunity that could better somebody’s plight, and performing rights were the most outrageous and egregious of bad treatment to the creative community. Every year I was sitting here looking at statements on major writers that were going down, down, down at a time when consumption of music was going up, up up.YouTube is an ongoing negotiation, but I’ve stepped out of it and allowed my team to handle it themselves because I’m too angry.Q. You have a famously combative reputation. There’s no shortage of old photos of you sticking up your middle finger.

A. Well, for one, I live in Hollywood, so you have to act a little. Two, if you show me a manager that’s never gotten into a fight, I’ll show you someone that’s badly represented their artist.I think passion is good in this era. When you’re dealing with these tech companies, they are worth zillions of dollars, more than the net worth of the entire music industry. I just don’t know why they have to be so heavy-handed.Q. You’ve run major record companies and been the chairman of Live Nation. Why is artist management the job that you always come back to?A. I think it’s what I’m best at, and where I can make the most difference. And if you are a fan of music, which I am, and a fan of the music business, which I am, you better have respect for the people with the creative talent, because without them none of us would be here.

Q. Recently it was announced that Guns N’ Roses would be reuniting for Coachella. You once briefly managed the band, and Axl Rose said that you had tried to pressure him into reuniting the original group.A. I would never go to an artist and say, “I want you to reunite.” If he had asked me if I thought it was a good idea, I would have said yes. But by the way, nobody tells Axl to do anything. He does what he wants to do.Slash and Duff McKagan are terrific people. Axl is a complicated individual that I wish nothing but success for. I think this is a good historical moment that the public deserves to see. I hope it happens.Q. What was it like for you when Glenn Frey died? He had been your client for more than 40 years.A. It was more like losing a brother first, and then a trusted personal friend, and a client third. It was hard, really hard. I was pretty forthcoming in the statement that he died from complications of rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis and pneumonia. But there’s been all this speculation over what role, if any, the drugs he was taking had in it. When you go on TV and you think, why are there 10 seconds to this drug ad and then 25 seconds of disclaimers? But the reason those disclaimers are up there is that it obviously happens to people. It just happened to Glenn.The Eagles’ career was on an upward spiral, as was Fleetwood Mac, another client, and Steely Dan. Things from that era that still sound great live, they were just getting bigger and bigger. Glenn always said, “The first time we went out on a high, and when we stop touring the second time, it’s going to be the same thing.”We didn’t intend for it to end this way, but you couldn’t write the script for how to have it end any bigger.

Due primarily to its low royalty payments and safe-harbor protection, YouTube has been the whipping boy of the music industry for several years now. So when the first installment of a study the company commissioned from RBB Economics was issued earlier this month — and which claimed, among other things, that piracy would actually increase without YouTube, and that 85 percent of the time currently spent watching music videos on YouTube would be spent on similar or lower-value channels — the reaction was strong.
And possibly the strongest on-the-record reaction came, not surprisingly, from veteran artist manager Irving Azoff, a longtime YouTube critic who wrote an open letter directed at the platform a year ago.



“My report about the ‘Value of YouTube to the Music Industry’ would be really brief because I can summarize the benefit of YouTube to artists in a word: none,” he told Hits. “They say without YouTube, users would look for sites that paid even less for music — I say good luck finding services that benefit so greatly from music and pay so little.
“Google’s Alphabet has a market cap of $660 billion, and YouTube itself is worth somewhere north of $90 billion—a value it acquired, in large part, on the backs of music artists,” he continued. “But they’d rather spend their money on dishonest studies to justify their measly payments than offer creators what they deserve for the use of their work.”
And another thing — “The truth is that, despite having to compete with services like YouTube who hide behind outdated, safe harbor protections, legitimate services like Spotify and Apple Music are attracting more subscribers than ever,” he continued. “If YouTube had the same level of commitment, their subscription service would be more than a head fake—and they’d be working hard, like Spotify does, to convert users to the paid tier for unlimited music. Maybe Google should do a study on that.”

Irving Azoff Threatens to Yank 20,000 Songs From YouTube (Exclusive) | Hollywood Reporter

Irving Azoff Threatens to Yank 20,000 Songs From YouTube (Exclusive)



Jeffrey Mayer/Universal Music Group

















The industry heavyweight, representing Pharrell Williams and others, believes that YouTube hasn't made all necessary deals for its new subscription service and is prepared to take his clients off of the YouTube ecosystem





Many works composed by popular musicians including The Eagles, Pharrell Williams, Boston, Foreigner, John Lennon, Smokey Robinson, Chris Cornell, and George and Ira Gershwin could soon be removed from YouTube.
On Wednesday, just as Google announced the coming launch of YouTube Music Key, its much-anticipated subscription service that will compete with Spotify and Pandora, music industry heavyweight Irving Azoff told The Hollywood Reporter that he is prepared to take 42 of his clients, representing some 20,000 copyrighted works, away from the YouTube ecosystem, including the new Music Key. The move is a huge shot across Google's bow, perhaps even more significant than Taylor Swift's much-discussed decision a week ago to remove her songs from Spotify over doubts about royalties.
Azoff is the former chairman of Live Nation who is now spearheading a new venture, Global Music Rights (GMR), aimed at extracting higher performance rights royalties for songwriters. Traditionally, those rights have been handled by ASCAP and BMI, which have been hamstrung by consent decrees with the Justice Department that requires a license be given whenever an outlet requests it.
Although the DOJ is currently reviewing the consent decrees, Azoff is moving quickly and has a message that appeals to many songwriters: As consumers gravitate more and more to streaming services in lieu of purchasing music, these services should be contributing more compensation to the ones who compose the music.
"The way fans listen to music is evolving daily," says Azoff. "GMR is going to give songwriters and publishers an opportunity to engage in meaningful licensing for their intellectual property. The trampling of writers' rights in the digital marketplace without any regard to their contribution to the creative process will no longer be tolerated."
The big record labels have already made deals with YouTube, owned by Google. But earlier this year, controversy erupted when smaller independent labels reacted negatively to the licensing terms being offered. At one point, there was even speculation that works from Adele, The White Stripes, Radiohead and Vampire Weekend would be blocked from YouTube, but in the last 24 hours came reports that Merlin, representing thousands of small labels around the world, had come to terms with YouTube.
Those deals would only cover sound recording rights, though, which have traditionally brought in the bulk of revenue from digital services.
The owners of songwriter or publishing rights, on the other hand, have long struggled to see significant compensation from digital services. In past years, publishers have employed a variety of strategies to rectify this — suing over novelties like ringtones and targeting YouTube specifically for allowing users to embed videos with music.
Most recently, the publisher war against YouTube has been fairly quiet — with ASCAP and BMI making deals with the online video service — instead focusing its attention on Pandora. Universal and Sony have made direct deals with Pandora, which is currently in the midst of a dispute over rates with song publishers. But not everyone has forgotten about YouTube, which according to a recent Nielsen survey, is more popular among teenagers for music than radio.
Irving Azoff certainly has not forgotten.
Randy Grimmett, who works with Azoff at Global Music Rights, points to publisher deals with Pandora and says the same thing needs to happen as far as YouTube is concerned. He says "there's no business to be built upon unlicensed works," and adds that there needs to be "parity" between the songwriter's side and the record owner's side of the industry.
Unlike ASCAP and BMI and the publishers they represent, Azoff and Grimmett have more negotiating leverage for doing direct deals with digital services, and so on Tuesday, they are going public in an attempt to get YouTube to acknowledge that more licensing work needs to be done.
We will update with any response from YouTube.

Irving Azoff, Tim Leiweke Angle to Buy Music Trade Publications in Bid to Challenge Billboard



Two veteran music execs in talks to purchase Pollstar after acquiring Venues Today

Music industry moguls Irving Azoff and Tim Leiweke are on a buying spree, purchasing live-music trade publications in an apparent bid to challenge industry giant Billboard.
Azoff and Leiweke are in talks to buy the music-touring trade Pollstar, according to the Wall Street Journal. The same duo recently bought Venues Today, a leading publication covering live entertainment and performance venues.
The duo founded Oak View Group in 2016 and the company is quickly building its media portfolio with a conference business as well as traditional trade publications.

Venues Today is involved in three conferences — Venue Operations Summit (VOS) in Nashville, Sport, Entertainment & Venues Tomorrow (SEVT) in Columbia, S.C., and Raising the Industry in Sport & Entertainment (RISE) in Long Beach, Calif.
If Oak View Group successfully acquires Pollstar, it comes with the Pollstar Live Conference, which costs at least $799 to attend and attracts a variety of corporate sponsors. The conference bills itself as an exploration of the “ins and outs of the live event industry” featuring agents, managers, promoters, road warriors, venue executives and professionals from all across the industry.






The Journal pointed out that while most print publications are currently struggling to survive in the modern media landscape, trade publications are tied with the industries they cover.
Luckily for Oak View Group, the music industry is rebounding and record labels saw their sales volume grow 3 percent last year, according to the Journal, which cited Nielsen Music. The popularity of streaming music services and a steady demand in attending live shows has helped the industry rebound from years of declining album sales.

Late last year, the Hollywood Reporter-Billboard Media Group acquired SpinMedia’s music assets Spin, Vibe, and Stereogum, giving the company an online audience of 45 million readers per month.
It appears Oak View Group is gearing up to take on Billboard, which is the music industry’s best-known trade but has been criticized by Azoff over the past few years.
Back in 2015, Azoff tweeted, “Billboard continues their march to irrelevance,” when the magazine ran what he called an “unwarranted attack” on music executive Marty Bandier.
Azoff is one of the most powerful men in the industry, representing acts such as the Eagles, Christina Aguilera, Van Halen, No Doubt, Maroon 5, Bon Jovi and Harry Styles. He is also the former executive chairman of America’s biggest concert promoter, Live Nation.
Meanwhile, Leiweke is the former CEO of Live Nation’s biggest competitor, Anschutz Entertainment Group. He also has experience in non-music live events, as he is the former CEO of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, which controls a variety of professional sports franchises.

Irving Azoff's Global Music Rights Files Motion to Dismiss RMLC's Anti-Trust Lawsuit

Azoff recently likened radio to a 'cartel' conspiring to keep songwriter payments Low.

Global Music Rights, as expected, has filed a motion to dismiss the Radio Music Licensing Committee’s anti-trust lawsuit against the performance rights organization in the U.S. Eastern District Court of Pennsylvania.The court document, filed by O’Melveny & Myers LLP and Harkins Cunningham LLP on behalf of GMR on Jan. 20, says that the court where RMLC filed its lawsuit lacks personal jurisdiction and is an improper forum in which to adjudicate the dispute; and notes that the RMLC complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.On the first point, the GMR filing points out that neither the defendant or plaintiff are located in Pennsylvania, where the suit was initially filed on Nov. 18. GMR responded by filing its own anti-trust lawsuit against the RMLC, alleging it is acting like a cartel, in the U.S. central District Court of California.


If the Pennsylvania case is not going to be dismissed and must be adjudicated, the latest filing states that the case should be in the U.S. Central District of California Court because that’s where GMR is located and the only licensing negotiations that happened in person occurred there; and RMLC also has twice has many member radio stations in California than it does in Pennsylvania, according to the document.Once again, GMR, founded by renowned artist manager Irving Azoff in 2013 and headed by former ASCAP executive Randy Grimmett, makes the case that it is much smaller than the plaintiff and that if anyone is wielding anti-trust practices, it is the RMLC. For one, GMR only handles 73 songwriters, which combined have a share in 20,000 songs--including ones by by the Eagles, Metallica, OneRepublic, Drake, Pharrell Williams and John Lennon--and which only make up one-eightt of 1% of all songs available for radio to play; and its songs only get between 5%-to 7.5% of all radio play. In contrast, the RMLC members combined own about 10,000 radio stations that generate about 90% of U.S. terrestrial radio revenue.It charges that the RMLC is trying to impose a compulsory licensing scheme with a rate court as if GMR had a consent decree from the Dept. of Justice, which regulates two of its much larger competitors, BMI and ASCAP. In addition, the RMLC filed a similar lawsuit in 2012 against the fourth U.S. performance rights organization, SESAC, which agreed to a settlement that includes arbitration if the two sides can't negotiate a fee.Since the RMLC insisted on those terms, GMR tried to negotiate directly with RMLC members but was only successful in cutting a deal with iHeartMedia, the largest terrestrial radio network in the U.S; and with TownSquare, which according to its website owns 312 radio stations in 66 markets.Contrary to the RMLC charges, GMR asserts that as a new PRO, it is creating more competition, especially for songwriters. Moreover, the GMR documents points out that its conduct won’t harm the consumer, i.e., the radio listening public, since terrestrial radio is already free to listen to.


While the two sides are involved in litigation, there appears to be ongoing dialog. On Christmas Eve, for an undisclosed fee, GMR offered a temporarily license that needs to be signed by Jan. 31 that would allow radio to continue to playing GR songs through Sept. 30, 2017, with each party reserving the right to seek a retroactive fee adjustment. That proposed adjustment would depend on a future licensing agreement, the outcome of the antitrust litigation, or a possible settlement between the RMLC and GMR.According to the initial lawsuit, GMR is seeking $42 million combined for the 10,000 radio stations to license its music for a year. Any station that signs the interim license agreement by Jan. 31 and pays the applicable interim license fee will not be subject to copyright infringement claims while the interim license is in effect.On Jan. 9, the RMLC issued a letter to its broadcasters saying that the wording used by GMR in sending out the interim license “incorrectly asserts that the fee was ‘negotiated’ with the RMLC," although the radio group concedes that it did work with GMR to help it offer its members the temporary license. Negotiation is a mis-characterization, according to the RMLC, which characterizes the arrangement as non-negotiable, a take it or leave it proposition fro the GMR.


Secondly, according to the RMLC, the letter with the interim license from GMR incorrectly states that the fees to each station was calculated by the radio group. THE RMLC said it wasn’t involved or “would ever entertain any involvement whatsoever in GMR’s final fee calculations,” according to the radio group letter to its members.“The RMLC believes that these GMR representations, as the level of the RMLC involvement with their interim license offering borders on bad faith at the very least and are intended to lend an RMLC stamp of approval to the process."While the interim license fee was initially undisclosed, GMR was trying to secure industry payments totaling $2.5 million per month for the temporary license, according to that letter. The RMLC letter says it is not disparaging or recommending GMR’s interim license offer.The following day, GMR responded to the RMLC letter with its own letter to RMLC stations:“The interim license was the product of weeks of negotiations, proposals, and counter-proposals between GMR and RMLC,” according to a copy of that letter. “Despite this documented history, the RMLC issued yesterday a statement on its website claiming it did not negotiate the $2,500,000 monthly fee or your company’s allocation of that fee. Both statements are categorically false.”While the two parties were involved in long-term negotiations, the RMLC proposed a one-year deal that would pay out about $27 million, or $2.25 million per month from the stations that abided by the RMLC negotiations.  GMR made a counter proposal of $30 million, or $2.5 million a month, which the RMLC rejected and then filed the lawsuit.Despite the lawsuit, GMR said it was willing to still offer a temporary license at its last rate. “In the course of our ensuing negotiations, the RMLC prepared and sent to GMR a detailed spreadsheet allocating the $2.5 million among each member of the RMLC,” according to the GMR letter. “The interim license fees that we sent to each of you over the weekend were taken directly from the RLMC's spreadsheet,  In addition, the interim license itself was reviewed, revised, and approved by the RMLC and its counsel.  All of this is documented.  The RMLC’s contrary statements are inexcusable and counterproductive.”

Biography[edit]
Raised in a Jewish family[4] in Danville, Illinois, Azoff began promoting and booking bands while a student at Danville High School and then in college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He moved to Los Angeles in 1970 with his first client, Dan Fogelberg. He worked for Geffen-Roberts Management and there began working with the Eagles, a relationship that has lasted more than forty years. During his career he has worked as an agent, personal manager, concert promoter, movie producer, independent record label owner, merchandiser, music publisher, and CEO of a record company.[citation needed]
From 1983 to 1989, Azoff was chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group and is credited for turning around that label's fortunes.[5]
According to Thomas R. King's book The Operator (2001), David Geffen manipulated Azoff into leaving MCA and going to Warner Music Group, where Azoff started Giant Records. King writes that Geffen wanted Azoff out at MCA to clear the way for MCA to buy Geffen Records.[6] Geffen convinced Mo Ostin at Warner Music to offer Irving Azoff a "dream" label deal. Giant Records operated for much of the 1990s until Azoff decided to return to concentrating on artist management.[citation needed]
Azoff co-produced the movies Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Urban Cowboy, Jack Frost (1998 film), Above The Rim, and The Inkwell, and was executive producer of The Hurricane.[7] He has been named "Manager of the Year" by two touring industry trade publications. In 2012, Azoff appeared in Artifact, a documentary film about the modern music business focused on the legal battle between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI.[citation needed] In 2015, he played a thinly veiled version of himself in the Documentary Now! parody of History of the Eagles.[8]
Business developments[edit]
In October 2008, ticketing and marketing company Ticketmaster announced they would acquire the management company Front Line Management Group, Inc. As part of the deal, Azoff, who was founder and chief executive officer of Front Line, became chief executive officer of Ticketmaster and was named chairman of Live Nation in February 2011.[2]
In September 2013, Azoff unveiled Azoff MSG Entertainment, a venture with The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG).[9] In addition to his role as chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment, Azoff would serve as a consultant to MSG in connection with the management of its live event venues, including the Forum in Inglewood, CA and other MSG-managed buildings.[10]
In 2012, he topped Billboard Magazine's Power 100, being named the most powerful person in the music industry.[11] Azoff serves on the boards of iHeartCommunications, Inc. and Starz LLC.

Nationality
United States


Occupation

Known for
Chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment


Irving Azoff (born December 12, 1947) is an American entertainment executive and personal manager, representing recording artists such as Harry Styles, Christina Aguilera, Journey, the Eagles, Dan Fogelberg, Joe Walsh, Van Halen, Thirty Seconds to Mars, Steely Dan, Maroon 5, No Doubt, Gwen Stefani, Triumph, Lindsey Buckingham of Fleetwood Mac, Jon Bon Jovi, Bon Jovi, and entertainer Chelsea Handler.
Since September 2013, he has been chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment, a venture with The Madison Square Garden Company. Prior to this he served as chairman and CEO of Ticketmaster Entertainment and was executive chairman of Live Nation Entertainment and CEO of Front Line Management. He is also on the board of Clear Channel Communications,[1] Starz Inc., and IMG.[2]

Biography[edit]
Raised in a Jewish family[4] in Danville, Illinois, Azoff began promoting and booking bands while a student at Danville High School and then in college at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He moved to Los Angeles in 1970 with his first client, Dan Fogelberg. He worked for Geffen-Roberts Management and there began working with the Eagles, a relationship that has lasted more than forty years. During his career he has worked as an agent, personal manager, concert promoter, movie producer, independent record label owner, merchandiser, music publisher, and CEO of a record company.[citation needed]
From 1983 to 1989, Azoff was chairman of MCA Music Entertainment Group and is credited for turning around that label's fortunes.[5]
According to Thomas R. King's book The Operator (2001), David Geffen manipulated Azoff into leaving MCA and going to Warner Music Group, where Azoff started Giant Records. King writes that Geffen wanted Azoff out at MCA to clear the way for MCA to buy Geffen Records.[6] Geffen convinced Mo Ostin at Warner Music to offer Irving Azoff a "dream" label deal. Giant Records operated for much of the 1990s until Azoff decided to return to concentrating on artist management.[citation needed]
Azoff co-produced the movies Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Urban Cowboy, Jack Frost (1998 film), Above The Rim, and The Inkwell, and was executive producer of The Hurricane.[7] He has been named "Manager of the Year" by two touring industry trade publications. In 2012, Azoff appeared in Artifact, a documentary film about the modern music business focused on the legal battle between Thirty Seconds to Mars and record label EMI.[citation needed] In 2015, he played a thinly veiled version of himself in the Documentary Now! parody of History of the Eagles.[8]
Business developments[edit]
In October 2008, ticketing and marketing company Ticketmaster announced they would acquire the management company Front Line Management Group, Inc. As part of the deal, Azoff, who was founder and chief executive officer of Front Line, became chief executive officer of Ticketmaster and was named chairman of Live Nation in February 2011.[2]
In September 2013, Azoff unveiled Azoff MSG Entertainment, a venture with The Madison Square Garden Company (MSG).[9] In addition to his role as chairman and CEO of Azoff MSG Entertainment, Azoff would serve as a consultant to MSG in connection with the management of its live event venues, including the Forum in Inglewood, CA and other MSG-managed buildings.[10]
In 2012, he topped Billboard Magazine's Power 100, being named the most powerful person in the music industry.[11] Azoff serves on the boards of iHeartCommunications, Inc. and Starz LLC.
Labels founded by Azoff[edit]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
