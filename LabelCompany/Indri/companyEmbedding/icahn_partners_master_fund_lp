Icahn Enterprises L.P. Announces Hiring Of Dr. Richard C. Mulligan






GlobeNewswire



Mar 1, 2017 8:01 AM EST













 


















































 NEW YORK, March 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icahn Enterprises L.P. (NASDAQ:IEP) today announced that Icahn Capital LP, its wholly owned subsidiary, has hired Dr. Richard C. Mulligan as a Portfolio Manager. Dr. Mulligan will be focused on biotechnology investments for Icahn Partners LP and Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, the private investment funds comprising Icahn Enterprises' Investment segment. "We are very pleased to have Richard join Icahn Capital given the depth and level of experience he brings as we look to enhance our focus on the biotechnology sector," said Carl C. Icahn, Chairman of Icahn Enterprises. Richard C. Mulligan is currently the Mallinckrodt Professor of Genetics, Emeritus, at Harvard Medical School, and Visiting Scientist at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. Previously, Professor Mulligan was the Mallinckrodt Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School, and Director of the Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative, an integrated effort amongst basic science and clinical investigators at Harvard University and its Affiliated Hospitals directed towards the pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of novel gene-based therapies for inherited and acquired diseases. Professor Mulligan received his B.S. degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and his Ph.D. from the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine, where he studied under Nobel Laureate Paul Berg. After receiving postdoctoral training at the Center for Cancer Research at MIT with Nobel Laureates David Baltimore and Phillip Sharp, Professor Mulligan joined the MIT faculty and subsequently was appointed Professor of Molecular Biology and Member of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research before moving to Harvard and Children's Hospital in 1996. His honors include the MacArthur Foundation 'Genius' Prize, the Rhodes Memorial Award of the American Association for Cancer Research, the ASMB-Amgen Award, and the Nagai Foundation International Prize. Professor Mulligan is an internationally recognized pioneer in the development of new technologies for transferring genes into mammalian cells. A major interest in Professor Mulligan's laboratory has been the development of genetically engineered animal viruses as gene transfer 'vectors'. Scientists use the specialized tools created in his laboratory to unravel basic questions about human development and to devise new clinical 'gene therapies' for the treatment of both inherited diseases and acquired diseases.
