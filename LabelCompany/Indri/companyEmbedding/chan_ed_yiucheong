True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. ~70% Success Rate.
                   Overview: Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.
It is our number 2 choice. To read the full review just click to Learn More.

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

              Overview: Main ingredients in Steel Libido Red include L-Citrulline, Velvet Bean Extract, Ginseng, Ginkgo Balboa and Theobromine.  Most of the customer reviews we found online were positive. 
Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

About Yum China Holdings
Yum China Holdings will become a licensee of Yum! Brands in Mainland China. It will have exclusive rights to KFC, China’s leading quick-service restaurant concept, Pizza Hut, the leading casual dining brand, and Taco Bell, which is expanding globally but is not yet in China. It will also own the Little Sheep and East Dawning concepts outright. The new company will be well positioned for growth thanks to its strong competitive position, integration of its brands into Chinese popular culture and consumers’ daily lives, expanding geographic footprint in China and existing operational expertise. It will have a strong capital position, no debt and expects to continue growing its system sales and profit by adding new restaurants and through growing same-store sales. Yum China has more than 7,200 restaurants in over 1,100 cities in China and generated over $8 billion in system sales in 2015. The growth of consumption in China is being fueled by a new generation of younger consumers who are digitally sophisticated and brand driven. The additional growth of the middle class and urban population in China is expected to create the world’s largest market for restaurant brands, with Yum China poised to be the market leader.
About Yum! Brands
Yum! Brands, Inc., based in Louisville, Kentucky, has nearly 43,000 restaurants in almost 140 countries and territories. Yum! Brands is ranked #218 on the Fortune 500 List with revenues of over $13 billion in 2015 and is one of the Aon Hewitt Top Companies for Leaders in North America. The Company’s restaurant brands – KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell – are the global leaders of the chicken, pizza and Mexican-style food categories. Worldwide, the Yum! Brands system opens over six new restaurants per day on average, making it a leader in global retail development.

True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

If you ever wanted to give any male enhancement a try, this is the one we recommend to go with.
Experiment Results: 17 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. 85%+ Success Rate.
Overview: ASOX9 was created by a researcher, and Harvard biology graduate who created the formula to help boost his own sexual performance. He spent years researching different formulas in order to undertand why many products didn't work for him, and ended up creating his own formula.  It's our top pick for the best male enhancement supplement of 2016. 

Users claim to have stronger and larger erections than ever before. Many of the users over 50 also report having an increased sex drive at an all time high and a better performance in the bedroom.

Older men say that they feel like  they are in their early 20s after an average of 1 to 3 weeks of use.

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

So give it a try for yourself and let us know what you think by emailing me at david.g@supplementreviewdigest.com

			      ASOX9 contains high amounts of Tong Kat Ali, Arginine, Maca, along with Oyster and Orchic Extract making it very unique. Click the learn more button to read the detailed review. Learn More or Order Here

Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.
