Publisher's Description▼▲
    "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. According to all that I shew thee, [after] the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make [it]." (Exodus 25:12, 89)    Since it was first produced in 2000, the original award-winning Tabernacle DVD has been a blessing to people all over the world.  Now re-created in all its splendor, The Tabernacle Special Edition DVD has been rebuilt, re-rendered and digitally mastered for an experience like no other.  Hear the sounds and walk where the Israelites walked.  Immerse yourself in an experience that is sure to capture your spirit and your heart.    This digitally mastered DVD presents you with vivid colors and contrasting images that have never before been seen this way.  You will see, firsthand, all the detail of scripture come alive in stunning quality and clarity.New in this Special Edition DVD: All new scenes Extended scenes Much more dynamic and engaging to watch visually.

Author Bio▼▲
AnimMan Studios was founded by Eric J. Bouchoc in 2000 in an attempt to bring artists from all over the country together to create imagery that had never been created before.  From that vision, The Tabernacle video was birthed.  Our work on The Tabernacle, taken from the bible, in the book of Exodus, has been rather extensive over the past 9 years.  Led by the Holy Spirit, we embarked on a journey that has brought a tremendous amount of joy to us.  We receive emails from all over the world telling us of the impact that this video has had on peoples lives.  We have no one else to thank and glorify than the Lord Christ Jesus!When we first began AnimMan Studios, we really had no idea what the Lord was going to do, but we knew that the gifts and talents that He has bestowed upon us were for a purpose.  Since that time, the company has seen the gospel go out and lives changed as a result.  To us, it really doesnt matter if you are Christian or Jew, believer or unbeliever&hellip;the Messiah has come and He is Christ the Lord Jesus!   We are convinced that the power in the gospel is enough to change your life forever and we are here, willing and obedient to be a vessel used of the Lord to see lives won for His glory.It is our prayer that the efforts that we put forth in our work will glorify Jesus and as a result your life will be changed as well.  The Tabernacle vision started in a small room with just a few of us having a bible study believing that if we simply opened Gods Word, He would show up.  Well, He did!  We have a simple promise from the Lord that says, "For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in the midst of them."  Our lives are changed and desire to be changed daily.  Wont you journey with us and allow your life to be changed as well?

            I was Amazed at the details presented from what the Bible tell us about The Tabernacle.  It makes the scripture come alive in stunning quality and understanding.  Piece by piece  seen in vivid colors and described in detail.   I agree with the other reviewer, "Beautifully done."  I would highly recommend this DVD.  It is worth the watch and than pass it on for others to see.  It would make a nice gift.  Enjoy!

            We watched this video as part of our small group study in Exodus, the tabernacle chapters. It greatly enhanced our study to actually visualize what we were reading and increased our reverence and awe for the scriptures.


Beautifully done.

From the creators of God's Not Dead! When a local pastor is shaken to the core by the visible faith of an elderly street-corner preacher, he's reminded that true belief always requires action. His response ignites a faith-fueled journey that powerfully impacts everybody it touches in ways that only God can orchestrate.  Rated PG-13. Dove approved (12+). Approx. 120 minutes.

 From the studio that brought you War Room and Miracles from Heaven comes a captivating new film!  All Saints is based on the inspiring true story of salesman-turned-pastor Michael Spurlock (John Corbett, My Big Fat Greek Weeding), the tiny church he was ordered to shut down, and a group of refugees from Southeast Asia. Together, they risked everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all. Look for it in theaters nationwide August 25!

Description
 
WHAT MANNER OF LOVE
(Text by Eric J. Alexander; Tune by Paul S. Jones)
.
O Christ, what love is this,
That all your loved ones know;
That brought you down from highest bliss
To live in such a world as this,
The Father’s will to do,
The Father’s will to do.
O Christ, what burdens these,
You bore on your own soul;
Our guilt, our judgment and God’s wrath:
The man of sorrows died our death,
And all to make us whole,
And all to make us whole.
O Christ, what dread reproach!
The Holy One made sin,
The King of Kings with thorns is crowned,
The Lord of heav’n and earth disowned,
And sinners welcomed in,
And sinners welcomed in!
O Christ, what joy is this?
The joy of sins forgiv’n,
No condemnation now we have,
Nor dark despair beyond the grave,
Instead, the hope of heav’n,
Instead, the hope of heav’n.
O Christ, what glory waits
The objects of your love!
No eye has seen nor ear has heard,
What God in his great grace prepared,
In that blest world above,
In that blest world above.

Product Description▼▲
High-Interest Guide Sure to Spark Curiosity and Conversation A surprising number of well-known Bible verses are commonly misused and misunderstood. Whether intentionally or not, people take important verses out of context, and pastor and Bible scholar Eric J. Bargerhuff has seen the effects: confusion, faulty decisions, sin being dismissed, and more. With a deft touch, he helps readers understand and apply sound principles of interpretation and application of twenty familiar verses. This concise high-interest approach appeals to the curious as well as readers concerned about incorrect theology.

            I did. After reading one particularly lengthy review this moved, which was going back and forth, to my cart.


It's a quick read. I am glad I purchased it. Short... but an interesting take on the verses discussed. I was thinking that I would be quite upset if the posed explanations went against my belief. Which they didn't. I just think I would have been strongly upset if I had bought into the misinterpretations, or, misunderstood way of interpretation. If that were to occur I would go on at length and break this book apart chapter by chapter in order to make an attempt to maintain my adherence to my misunderstandings without a truly, seeking for information mind. 


I'm so glad that didn't happen.

            I bought this book as soon as I read the description.  Our church is truly blessed to have a Pastor that clearly teaches the word of God.  In this book, the author undertakes the task of instructing the reader to the correct reading of a number of bible verses that have grown to be misused and misunderstood.  What many believers fail to do when reading scripture is to keep it in context.  I encourage you to read this book with your Bible open and test what Bargerhuff writes to scripture.  This book gives you a tool to help others understand and appreciate God's word.

Superficial, Confusing, Unsatisfying Exegesis


February 22, 2013



Nelson






  
            This book was rather disappointing for me. I thought it would an exegetically in-depth discussion on how certain verses in the Bible ought to be properly interpreted. It is not that Bargerhuff's method of interpretation is necessarily wrong, but discussion was superficial and interpretations ascertained solely on the basis of context (and maybe some common sense and simple logic). Nothing beyond that is developed.


If the book was "all about learning to properly interpret and apply the truths of the Bible", as the author claims in his "Acknowledgements" (p.12), it leaves out much to be desired. He somehow misses certain pertinent points. Therefore, while his conclusions are not entirely wrong, they do not reflect accurate interpretations of the Biblical texts he cites, which can lead to erroneous views regarding God's moral character as good.


For example:


1. On the interpretation in chapter 5 on John 14:13-14, about asking anything in Jesus' name, as the author concludes, "Our goal in prayer is to see God glorified no matter what" (p.61); and here I have no disagreement. However, that does not necessarily mean God would deny a request that, while it may not be something He specifically willed, nevertheless, is a desire of the petitioner that does not violate His general will. Cannot God answer a prayer even if it does not directly bear on glorifying Himself but is merely a desire of the petitioner that God answers simply because He is gracious?


2. Regarding Rom 8:28, chapter 6, the author states that "all things that happen in the Christian life are designed" to shape us into Jesus' image (p.67). By the word "design", does he mean God ordained, in the Calvinistic sense, "all things" that occur to occur? It would seem so because he further suggests that God is the one who brings "terrible tragedy" upon us (p.69). The question needs to be asked, what loving and good father would do that?


Again, Bargerhuff says, "Even the worst evil that happens...is for a greater good" (68) and gives us some examples. First of all, those examples do not necessarily prove that God designed/preordained these tragedies. These examples only show that God can overturn the resultant evil consequences for a good. His interpretations of the events are mere speculation.


If it is the case that God designed/preordained such events used as examples, then these events actually a great good and not genuinely evil. Furthermore, if his premise is correct, then no evil event is in reality an evil event but a good event. Bargerhuff practically agrees when In an endnote to this chapter, he asserts that "anything that glorifies God and advances his kingdom purposes could rightly be called good" (#3, pg.170). Therefore, I cannot see how he can legitimately escape the idea that the "worst evil that happens" (e.g. one's child being raped), an evil "designed" (if I have correctly understood the implications of his use of this word) by God, "could rightly be called good". Essentially, he is saying that there really is no such thing as evil or tragedy.


Bargerhuff seems to hold to certain errors found in Calvinism and engages their ususal brand of double-speak. This was the most unsatisfying chapter.


3. Chapter 10, regarding God allowing no more than one can handle, is the best chapter, even of handled lightly. My only reason for giving it two instead of one star.


4. Chapter 14 on the "prayer offered in faith" is handled confusingly (as I read it) and leaves open at the conclusion whether or not God will answer the pray made in faith, which flatly contradicts the promise left us in James 5:15, the specific verse he uses to correct what he sees is a flawed interpretation of it while, nevertheless, adding to the error rather than correcting it.


As I stated earlier, his engagement with the texts he choose is rather simplistic and confusing, so if you're looking for an in-depth book that makes good sense and corrects the misinterpretation others have of certain verses, particularly the ones the author chose to answer, this is not the book.

            Gives much needed perspectives on these verses. The author is really encouraging readers to understand the verses using context.
