Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

  Bonds represent the largest asset class in the world. The most affluent investors demand
them, and the most successful advisors rely on them to expand their market
opportunity. However, to capitalize on attractive issues and yield opportunities, advisors
need information, insight and the ability to take quick, decisive action.
   Deep roots and long relationships AAM has been deeply rooted in the fixed income markets for almost 30 years. Our long-standing relationships and trading expertise allow us to establish and maintain an attractive inventory of securities that gives you the opportunity to capitalize on pricing, yields and quality issues.   Dedicated AAM Capital Markets Group As part of our firm’s dedication to client service, our Capital Markets Group (CMG) is comprised of seasoned taxable and municipal fixed income traders. CMG works closely with our very own Advisory Consultants to provide competitive offerings, liquidity, and ongoing support and timely sales ideas to each financial professional we serve.   Seize opportunities with AAM Leveraging our open architecture platform and efficient online capabilities, AAM provides advisors with access to world-class bond solutions. Working with us, advisors can take advantage of competitive pricing and exclusive opportunities that broaden their existing platform and can enhance the value they provide to their clients.

Needs-based custom portfolios Our analysts can create individual portfolios designed to meet specific investor objectives, such as maximizing income, managing risk, tax-advantaged investing and wealth preservation, and then provide tools to assist with monitoring them against these objectives.   Flexible reporting services AAM conducts comprehensive portfolio reviews for new and existing holdings and produces detailed custom reports that show both before and after scenarios, and can be private labeled if needed.

History[edit]
1979–2002[edit]
In 1979, Jim Dillahunty founded Advisors Asset Management, which was known as Fixed Income Securities, Inc. (FIS) in San Diego, California.[5] In 1992, the firm began to streamline its technology trading platform and released Bond Express, one of the first electronic databases for dealer bond listings.[6] Three years later, Barra, Inc., who had invested heavily in the product's development, purchased FIS's interest in Bond Express.[7]
In 1998, Scott Colyer founded Sterling Resources, a fixed income and wealth preservation company for high-net-worth clients and institutions in Monument, Colorado. In 2001, FIS and Sterling Resources merged under Fixed Income Securities, LLC. The merger combined FIS's established account base and IT capabilities with the distribution, trading, and analytical capabilities of Sterling Resources. The firm established its niche by specializing in fixed income investments and portfolio support services exclusively for financial professionals and broker-dealers.[8]
2003–2007[edit]
FIS announces its new Advisors Asset Management (AAM) division to distribute unit investment trusts (UITs). In 2004, AAM became its own UIT sponsor acquiring Matrix Unit Trust, a UIT sponsor based out of Wichita, KS. These proprietary UITs were distributed under the AAM brand name.[9] The AAM division also launched a separately managed account (SMA) service consisting of advisory and sub-advisory fixed income portfolio management platforms.[10]
In early 2006, AAM announced a strategic alliance with Credit Suisse, adding structured products to its distribution offerings.[11] Soon thereafter, they announced an agreement to distribute a select group of Merrill Lynch products to registered investment advisors and independent broker-dealers. Focused mainly on structured products, this agreement with Merrill Lynch's Global Markets & Investment Banking (GMI) division provided the firm access to traditional equity and debt investment securities, such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks, and government agency issues.[12] AAM also added additional structured product sponsors to its offerings, including ABN AMRO and HSBC.[13]
In January 2007, AAM increased its assets under supervision by being named the successor sponsor of Defined Asset Funds (DAF) UIT portfolios formerly sponsored by Merrill Lynch.[14] They were also appointed the successor sponsor of approximately $1.8 billion of Citigroup's Tax Exempt Securities Trusts (TEST) assets the following year.[15] Later that year, AAM partnered with Envestnet in October to create a unified wealth management solution on the Envestnet platform by adding a fixed income component to their existing portfolio services.[16]
2008–present[edit]
In an effort to strengthen name recognition and better define their expanding product offerings, FIS and its AAM division unified under one brand name and officially became Advisors Asset Management, Inc. in June 2008.[17]
In 2009, AAM launched a new Institutional Sales and Trading division in Manhattan, New York to expand its fixed income product distribution to the institutional markets.[18]
In April 2012, AAM’s High 50® Dividend Strategy Portfolio exceeded $1 billion in assets.[19] In September 2012, AAM was named to Inc. Magazine's list of the 5000 fastest growing companies for the fourth year in a row, ranking 160 in the financial services industry.[20]
In January 2014, AAM began its partnership with ISI, Inc. to launch a new unit investment trust (UIT).[21] In June 2014, AAM surpassed $10 billion in unit investment trust assets.[22]
In March 2015, AAM began its partnership with Cyrus J. Lawrence LLC (the former investment management division of ISI, Inc.) following ISI Group’s acquisition by publicly held Evercore Partners in October 2014.[23] Financial services industry veteran John Radtke also joined the firm in March 2015 as Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Capital Markets Sales. The firm plans to leverage Mr. Radtke's extensive expertise related to the fixed income markets to help advisors identify new investment opportunities in light of changing market conditions, and grow its capital markets teams.[24]
In March 2016, AAM announced its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management, the U.S. asset management business of Rothschild & Co ("Rothschild"). The partnership will combine AAM’s national distribution model with Rothschild’s investment management capabilities.[25] In June 2016, AAM expanded its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management to become the distributor for select separately managed accounts (SMAs).[26] In September 2016, AAM expanded its partnership with global investment manager, Cohen & Steers. Cohen & Steers became the portfolio consultant to several of AAM’s unit investment trusts, all of which were co-branded.[27]
In February 2017, AAM hired Charles Sickles as the firm’s Managing Director and Head of Wholesale Distribution and will lead AAM’s distribution efforts across all of its partner firms. Mr. Sickles has over 27 years of experience and previously served as managing director at BlackRock.[28] In March 2017, AAM was recognized as an industry leader in structured products by mtn-i, a London-based global provider of market information for structured notes, private placements and MTN market coverage. AAM received prominent distinctions in two categories: Structured Investment Advisor of the Year and U.S. Deal of the Year. The award for U.S. Deal of the Year was given to AAM and Citi for its successful partnership developing the USD4m Infrastructure Stock Basket-Linked Notes, due 2020.[29]

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

History[edit]
1979–2002[edit]
In 1979, Jim Dillahunty founded Advisors Asset Management, which was known as Fixed Income Securities, Inc. (FIS) in San Diego, California.[5] In 1992, the firm began to streamline its technology trading platform and released Bond Express, one of the first electronic databases for dealer bond listings.[6] Three years later, Barra, Inc., who had invested heavily in the product's development, purchased FIS's interest in Bond Express.[7]
In 1998, Scott Colyer founded Sterling Resources, a fixed income and wealth preservation company for high-net-worth clients and institutions in Monument, Colorado. In 2001, FIS and Sterling Resources merged under Fixed Income Securities, LLC. The merger combined FIS's established account base and IT capabilities with the distribution, trading, and analytical capabilities of Sterling Resources. The firm established its niche by specializing in fixed income investments and portfolio support services exclusively for financial professionals and broker-dealers.[8]
2003–2007[edit]
FIS announces its new Advisors Asset Management (AAM) division to distribute unit investment trusts (UITs). In 2004, AAM became its own UIT sponsor acquiring Matrix Unit Trust, a UIT sponsor based out of Wichita, KS. These proprietary UITs were distributed under the AAM brand name.[9] The AAM division also launched a separately managed account (SMA) service consisting of advisory and sub-advisory fixed income portfolio management platforms.[10]
In early 2006, AAM announced a strategic alliance with Credit Suisse, adding structured products to its distribution offerings.[11] Soon thereafter, they announced an agreement to distribute a select group of Merrill Lynch products to registered investment advisors and independent broker-dealers. Focused mainly on structured products, this agreement with Merrill Lynch's Global Markets & Investment Banking (GMI) division provided the firm access to traditional equity and debt investment securities, such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks, and government agency issues.[12] AAM also added additional structured product sponsors to its offerings, including ABN AMRO and HSBC.[13]
In January 2007, AAM increased its assets under supervision by being named the successor sponsor of Defined Asset Funds (DAF) UIT portfolios formerly sponsored by Merrill Lynch.[14] They were also appointed the successor sponsor of approximately $1.8 billion of Citigroup's Tax Exempt Securities Trusts (TEST) assets the following year.[15] Later that year, AAM partnered with Envestnet in October to create a unified wealth management solution on the Envestnet platform by adding a fixed income component to their existing portfolio services.[16]
2008–present[edit]
In an effort to strengthen name recognition and better define their expanding product offerings, FIS and its AAM division unified under one brand name and officially became Advisors Asset Management, Inc. in June 2008.[17]
In 2009, AAM launched a new Institutional Sales and Trading division in Manhattan, New York to expand its fixed income product distribution to the institutional markets.[18]
In April 2012, AAM’s High 50® Dividend Strategy Portfolio exceeded $1 billion in assets.[19] In September 2012, AAM was named to Inc. Magazine's list of the 5000 fastest growing companies for the fourth year in a row, ranking 160 in the financial services industry.[20]
In January 2014, AAM began its partnership with ISI, Inc. to launch a new unit investment trust (UIT).[21] In June 2014, AAM surpassed $10 billion in unit investment trust assets.[22]
In March 2015, AAM began its partnership with Cyrus J. Lawrence LLC (the former investment management division of ISI, Inc.) following ISI Group’s acquisition by publicly held Evercore Partners in October 2014.[23] Financial services industry veteran John Radtke also joined the firm in March 2015 as Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Capital Markets Sales. The firm plans to leverage Mr. Radtke's extensive expertise related to the fixed income markets to help advisors identify new investment opportunities in light of changing market conditions, and grow its capital markets teams.[24]
In March 2016, AAM announced its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management, the U.S. asset management business of Rothschild & Co ("Rothschild"). The partnership will combine AAM’s national distribution model with Rothschild’s investment management capabilities.[25] In June 2016, AAM expanded its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management to become the distributor for select separately managed accounts (SMAs).[26] In September 2016, AAM expanded its partnership with global investment manager, Cohen & Steers. Cohen & Steers became the portfolio consultant to several of AAM’s unit investment trusts, all of which were co-branded.[27]
In February 2017, AAM hired Charles Sickles as the firm’s Managing Director and Head of Wholesale Distribution and will lead AAM’s distribution efforts across all of its partner firms. Mr. Sickles has over 27 years of experience and previously served as managing director at BlackRock.[28] In March 2017, AAM was recognized as an industry leader in structured products by mtn-i, a London-based global provider of market information for structured notes, private placements and MTN market coverage. AAM received prominent distinctions in two categories: Structured Investment Advisor of the Year and U.S. Deal of the Year. The award for U.S. Deal of the Year was given to AAM and Citi for its successful partnership developing the USD4m Infrastructure Stock Basket-Linked Notes, due 2020.[29]

History[edit]
1979–2002[edit]
In 1979, Jim Dillahunty founded Advisors Asset Management, which was known as Fixed Income Securities, Inc. (FIS) in San Diego, California.[5] In 1992, the firm began to streamline its technology trading platform and released Bond Express, one of the first electronic databases for dealer bond listings.[6] Three years later, Barra, Inc., who had invested heavily in the product's development, purchased FIS's interest in Bond Express.[7]
In 1998, Scott Colyer founded Sterling Resources, a fixed income and wealth preservation company for high-net-worth clients and institutions in Monument, Colorado. In 2001, FIS and Sterling Resources merged under Fixed Income Securities, LLC. The merger combined FIS's established account base and IT capabilities with the distribution, trading, and analytical capabilities of Sterling Resources. The firm established its niche by specializing in fixed income investments and portfolio support services exclusively for financial professionals and broker-dealers.[8]
2003–2007[edit]
FIS announces its new Advisors Asset Management (AAM) division to distribute unit investment trusts (UITs). In 2004, AAM became its own UIT sponsor acquiring Matrix Unit Trust, a UIT sponsor based out of Wichita, KS. These proprietary UITs were distributed under the AAM brand name.[9] The AAM division also launched a separately managed account (SMA) service consisting of advisory and sub-advisory fixed income portfolio management platforms.[10]
In early 2006, AAM announced a strategic alliance with Credit Suisse, adding structured products to its distribution offerings.[11] Soon thereafter, they announced an agreement to distribute a select group of Merrill Lynch products to registered investment advisors and independent broker-dealers. Focused mainly on structured products, this agreement with Merrill Lynch's Global Markets & Investment Banking (GMI) division provided the firm access to traditional equity and debt investment securities, such as convertible bonds, preferred stocks, and government agency issues.[12] AAM also added additional structured product sponsors to its offerings, including ABN AMRO and HSBC.[13]
In January 2007, AAM increased its assets under supervision by being named the successor sponsor of Defined Asset Funds (DAF) UIT portfolios formerly sponsored by Merrill Lynch.[14] They were also appointed the successor sponsor of approximately $1.8 billion of Citigroup's Tax Exempt Securities Trusts (TEST) assets the following year.[15] Later that year, AAM partnered with Envestnet in October to create a unified wealth management solution on the Envestnet platform by adding a fixed income component to their existing portfolio services.[16]
2008–present[edit]
In an effort to strengthen name recognition and better define their expanding product offerings, FIS and its AAM division unified under one brand name and officially became Advisors Asset Management, Inc. in June 2008.[17]
In 2009, AAM launched a new Institutional Sales and Trading division in Manhattan, New York to expand its fixed income product distribution to the institutional markets.[18]
In April 2012, AAM’s High 50® Dividend Strategy Portfolio exceeded $1 billion in assets.[19] In September 2012, AAM was named to Inc. Magazine's list of the 5000 fastest growing companies for the fourth year in a row, ranking 160 in the financial services industry.[20]
In January 2014, AAM began its partnership with ISI, Inc. to launch a new unit investment trust (UIT).[21] In June 2014, AAM surpassed $10 billion in unit investment trust assets.[22]
In March 2015, AAM began its partnership with Cyrus J. Lawrence LLC (the former investment management division of ISI, Inc.) following ISI Group’s acquisition by publicly held Evercore Partners in October 2014.[23] Financial services industry veteran John Radtke also joined the firm in March 2015 as Executive Vice President of Capital Markets and Capital Markets Sales. The firm plans to leverage Mr. Radtke's extensive expertise related to the fixed income markets to help advisors identify new investment opportunities in light of changing market conditions, and grow its capital markets teams.[24]
In March 2016, AAM announced its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management, the U.S. asset management business of Rothschild & Co ("Rothschild"). The partnership will combine AAM’s national distribution model with Rothschild’s investment management capabilities.[25] In June 2016, AAM expanded its strategic partnership with Rothschild Asset Management to become the distributor for select separately managed accounts (SMAs).[26] In September 2016, AAM expanded its partnership with global investment manager, Cohen & Steers. Cohen & Steers became the portfolio consultant to several of AAM’s unit investment trusts, all of which were co-branded.[27]
In February 2017, AAM hired Charles Sickles as the firm’s Managing Director and Head of Wholesale Distribution and will lead AAM’s distribution efforts across all of its partner firms. Mr. Sickles has over 27 years of experience and previously served as managing director at BlackRock.[28] In March 2017, AAM was recognized as an industry leader in structured products by mtn-i, a London-based global provider of market information for structured notes, private placements and MTN market coverage. AAM received prominent distinctions in two categories: Structured Investment Advisor of the Year and U.S. Deal of the Year. The award for U.S. Deal of the Year was given to AAM and Citi for its successful partnership developing the USD4m Infrastructure Stock Basket-Linked Notes, due 2020.[29]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
