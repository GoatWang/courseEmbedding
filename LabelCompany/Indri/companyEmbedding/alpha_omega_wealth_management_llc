LIFEPAC



Overview
LIFEPAC is a Christian homeschool curriculum for grades K-12. Designed by a team of accomplished educators with years of classroom experience, LIFEPAC is based on the principle of mastery learning. Students master content in each unit worktext before progressing to the next. Ten LIFEPAC worktexts provide one full year of learning content per grade level; individual worktexts can also be used as supplemental material. 
In addition, you can mix and match subjects or grade level worktexts to personalize your student's curriculum content. Individual worktexts take approximately 3 to 4 weeks to complete.

What are analysts saying about Caterpillar stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Caterpillar stock: 
1. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "hard to imagine a robust surge" in the near term. Nevertheless, the mining and energy sector as a whole has "passed the lows," and the company is well positioned to capitalize on its status as a leader in capital equipment and engines — when an upturn eventually arrives.Meanwhile, Caterpillar's cost-cutting initiatives, headcount reductions, improved sourcing and shuttering or consolidating more than 30 factories will reduce fixed costs by nearly $2 billion, the analyst continued. Also, the company can save another $750 million from the closings of two factories in Belgium and Illinois while incentive compensation fell by more than $1 billion since peaking in 2014 at $1.3 billion.Last, Caterpillar's new CEO Jim Umpleby is likely to focus on profitability, free cash flow, and returns as opposed to the recent CEO Doug Oberhelman who focused on penetrating new markets and gaining market share. As such, the company should now be viewed as "a whole different animal." (7/24/2017)
2. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Caterpillar’s May sales rose 8%, an improvement from 1% growth witnessed in the last two months thanks to continual improvement in Asia Pacific. It remains to be seen whether this momentum will be sustained as even though commodity prices have improved lately, it is not sufficient to drive a relevant increase in short-term demand for new equipment. Caterpillar guides revenues in the range of $38–$41 billion and earnings of $3.75 per share for 2017, a 2% and 10% year–over-year growth, respectively. In construction, Asia Pacific is showing promise while leading indicators of U.S. construction signal robust conditions ahead. The company’s efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks sub industry. Also, it has a positive record of earnings surprises." (7/14/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Cost cuts continue to benefit margins despite ongoing market weakness. 4Q16 earnings, ex. adjustments, were better than expected on favorable decremental margins in Construction and E&T versus modeled expectations. With FX remaining a headwind CAT lowered the mid-point of the 2017 revenue guide to $37.5bln (prior: ~$38bln) resulting in EPS of $2.90 (Consensus: $3.06). Shares continue to trade above 30x earnings, a premium to prior cycles." (1/27/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 9 Hold Ratings, 10 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.45)Consensus Price Target: $96.31 (15.91% downside)

13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

LIFEPAC



Overview
LIFEPAC is a Christian homeschool curriculum for grades K-12. Designed by a team of accomplished educators with years of classroom experience, LIFEPAC is based on the principle of mastery learning. Students master content in each unit worktext before progressing to the next. Ten LIFEPAC worktexts provide one full year of learning content per grade level; individual worktexts can also be used as supplemental material. 
In addition, you can mix and match subjects or grade level worktexts to personalize your student's curriculum content. Individual worktexts take approximately 3 to 4 weeks to complete.
