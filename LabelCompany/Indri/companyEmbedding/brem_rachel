Rachel Brem, Ph.D., Associate Professor
















Understanding how and why traits differ between individuals

Longevity, susceptibility to age-associated diseases, and many other attributes relevant for aging vary from one person to another. These differences are due in part to DNA sequence variants somewhere in our genomes—though exactly where is still a mystery in most cases. Worms, flies, and single-celled microbes can serve as powerful models for the study of the principles of genetic variation. Research in the Brem lab uses these model organisms to discover genetic changes that impact aging behaviors and other traits, as well as their evolutionary histories. The Brem lab approach uses large-scale analyses of thousands of genes at once, both computational and experimental, with ongoing work in the following areas:
The genetics of alternative polyadenylation. Most genes contain instructions for the production of a protein—a molecular machine that does work for the cell—including information that regulates the amount and timing of protein production. The regulatory sequence included at the end of a gene is defined by a process called polyadenylation. Cancer cells have dramatic changes in polyadenylation positions across the genomes, and in a few cases, other human diseases have been associated with naturally occurring genetic variants at gene ends. In general, how polyadenylation differs among genetically distinct individuals is almost completely unknown.  The Brem lab is dissecting the genetic basis of naturally occurring variation in gene ends and its impact on protein production. The ultimate goal is to understand sequence signals that drive alternative polyadenylation in individual genes as well as the master regulatory factors that carry out processing at many gene ends in parallel. Current work involves cancer samples and wild single-celled brewers’ yeast.
Natural variation in yeast and fly aging phenotypes.  Longevity, and its dependence on diet, can vary dramatically between genetically distinct individuals and between species. In the vast majority of cases, the genetic basis of these differences is uncharacterized.  The Brem lab is mapping genes that underlie naturally occurring differences in lifespan in two model organism systems: wild isolates of single-celled yeast cultured in different growth media, and wild-caught Drosophila flies reared on different food sources. The ultimate goal is to identify genes whose role in metabolism and aging is conserved between these simple organisms and humans.
Polygenic evolution. In wild environments, when DNA sequence variants in an organism’s genome confer a fitness advantage, they are maintained and passed to progeny by the process of natural selection. Starvation resistance, fertility, and other traits relevant for aging have been tuned by natural selection during the evolution of many species, likely including humans. How do we discover precisely which genetic changes have enabled adaptive benefits during evolutionary history? Standard approaches examine the DNA sequence of one gene at a time for signatures of natural selection. But a suite of independent genetic variants, at genes all over the genome, may together underlie an advantageous trait. The Brem lab has developed methods to harness groups of genes, rather than just one gene at a time, to detect this type of polygenic natural selection. These strategies use measurements of gene regulation across species as well as DNA sequences from individuals in populations.  The project’s current focus is on organism-level advantages to brewers’ yeast that result from polygenic suites of genetic variants, including metabolism and stress resistance.
Dr. Brem’s Ph.D. thesis work was in the lab of Ken Dill at the University of California, San Francisco, where she developed computational methods to model the forces that drive protein molecules to assemble. As a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Leonid Kruglyak at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, she pioneered large-scale experimental strategies to discover variants that underlie differences in gene regulation between genetically distinct individuals, using single-celled yeast as a model. She began her independent research career as an assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley before joining the Buck Institute in 2014. She was a recipient of the Burroughs-Wellcome Career Award at the Scientific Interface and the Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar Award in Aging.

Brem Foundation

































































 DETECT EARLY.SAVE LIVES.



 In 2016 40,450 women - moms, sisters, daughters, and friends - lost their lives to breast cancer. But it does not have to be this way. In 2017, over 316,120 people will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Over 95% of those diagnosed early will survive and thrive.  The Brem Foundation needs YOU to bring us closer to a world where more moms, sisters, friends, daughters, and wives get to be with their families for long, healthy years.  

#runforherlife











BREAST CANCER IS95% CURABLE WHENCAUGHT EARLY











SURVIVAL CANNOT BE THE ONLY METRICThe toll on a woman, her family, her caregivers, her employer, and the entire healthcare system is intensely different when she is diagnosed at early vs. later stage breast cancer. Even if she survives. That is why survival, alone, should not be the only metric for determining when and how to screen. "Intensity of care" cuts heavily in favor of every woman being properly screened at least every year after age 40. 

Advocate for yourself











3 IN 4 WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCERHAVE NOFAMILY HISTORY



















BREAST CANCER GENES CAN BE PASSED FROM EITHER PARENTGenetic mutations that increase a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer can be passed from her mother or her father.THE #1 RISK FACTOR FOR BREAST CANCER IS BEING A WOMANA family history of breast cancer increases a woman’s risk of getting the disease, but most women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of breast cancer. 

know your risk factors


LEARN WHERE TO START
A MAMMOGRAM IS JUST ONE OF MANY SCREENING OPTIONSOther screening options—such as ultrasound, MRI, tomosynthesis, and molecular breast imaging—should beutilized based on each woman’s risk factors.

Dr. Rachel Brem — Brem Foundation































































WHO WE AREDR. RACHEL BREM






The Brem Foundation is inspired by Dr. Rachel Brem’s mission and life story.The Brem Foundation is inspired by Dr. Rachel Brem’s mission and life story. As the Director of the Breast Imaging and Intervention Center and the Program Leader for Breast Cancer at the George Washington Cancer Center, Dr. Brem works everyday to prevent breast cancer from taking more lives.When Dr. Brem was twelve years old, her 33-year old mother was diagnosed with breast cancer—and was given six months to live. Despite the odds, Dr. Brem’s mother lived 43 years after her diagnosis—but this diagnosis inspired Dr. Brem to dedicate her life to curing breast cancer.At 24 years old, Dr. Brem graduated from Columbia Medical School. She then completed her Radiology and Breast Imaging training at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and joined the breast imaging team at Johns Hopkins.  Because of this philosophy, Dr. Brem often tried new equipment on herself before deciding whether or not to use it with her patients. While practicing medicine, Dr. Brem always prioritizes every patient’s health and comfort. One evening after her patients had gone home, Dr. Brem tried a piece of new equipment on herself. She just wanted to examine the image quality of the technology—but what she found was her own breast cancer. After fighting and beating the disease at age 37, and with three daughters aged 12, 9, and 9, Dr. Brem’s passion for her life’s work became even more intense.She continues to channel that passion to change the face of breast cancer. Her accomplishments all involve new technologies for the early detection of breast cancer. Specifically, she has led the field in Computer-Aided Detection (CAD), Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI), Automated Breast Ultrasound Systems (ABUS), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Her advancements have led to many awards and honors. These include Newsweek Magazine naming her as a top cancer doctor, appearing on the Dr. Oz show - where Dr. Oz described her as a "cancer detective", being named a Woman To Watch by Jewish Women International, and being named Woman of the Year by the International Biographical Center. Dr. Brem and her colleagues at GW built a cutting-edge, multidisciplinary breast cancer program at George Washington. She is a Fellow of the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging.
