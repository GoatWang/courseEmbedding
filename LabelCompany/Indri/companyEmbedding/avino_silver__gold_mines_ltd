Management





Gary Robertson
Chairman and Independent Director

Mr. Robertson is a Certified Financial Planner. He has worked in the financial industry for the past twenty years, and presently serves on the board of several private companies as well as on the board of 5 Canadian junior gold mining companies, including Bralorne Gold Mines Ltd., Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd., Coral Gold Resources Ltd., Mill Bay Ventures Inc. and Sage Gold Inc.



David Wolfin
President & CEO, Director

Mr. Wolfin brings 30 years of experience in mining and finance. He learned the business from the ground up, starting as a geologist's assistant in Nevada, a metallurgist's assistant at the Avino mine in Mexico and later in a number of mining and exploration-related capacities. In the late 1980s, Mr. Wolfin worked on the floor of the Vancouver Stock Exchange and also for several brokerage houses, gaining a solid foundation in the finance side of the industry.

Since 1990, Mr. Wolfin has worked for the Oniva Group of Resource companies, including Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd. (CEO, President & Director); Bralorne Gold Mines Ltd. (CEO, President & Director); Coral Gold Resources Ltd. (CEO, President & Director); and Levon Resources Ltd. (Former Director). In his various roles with these firms, he has helped raise over C$100 million.



Carlos Rodriguez
COO

Mr. Rodriguez Moreno is a professional geologist with over 27 years of experience in underground mines and regional exploration in Mexico. 

Mr. Rodriguez Moreno graduated in 1984 from the University of Sonora in Hermosillo, Mexico in geology. He is also a graduate from the Colorado School of Mines with a degree in mineral exploration. He is joining the Avino management team to strengthen the operational and managerial leadership at the Mine. 

Mr. Rodriguez Moreno is very familiar with the underground workings at the Avino Mine as he was the last chief geologist at Avino before the operation ceased in 2001. Since his last post at Avino, Mr. Rodriguez Moreno has worked for Luzon Minerals Ltd. in the States of San Luis Potosi, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas and Durango, Mexico, as well as for Kings Minerals Ltd., an Australian mining company exploring the Cerro El Gallo project in the state of Guanajuato. He joined Avino again in 2006 as mine exploration and general manager and was instrumental in the discovery of the San Gonzalo deposit in 2007. He started rehabilitating the 250 tpd flotation circuit, brought it on line in 2010, and built the water treatment facility for treating mine water and is now moving forward to re-furbish the 1,000 tpd circuit for a total mill throughput of 1,250 tpd.

1 Metal Production is expressed in terms of silver equivalent ounces, (oz Ag Eq.), the formula for which depends on the gold and silver metal prices used in each year and hence are only indicative.
2�The Company reports non-IFRS measures which include cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce, and cash flow per share. These measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning and the calculation methods may differ from methods used by other companies with similar reported measures.
Under National Instrument 43-101, the Company is required to disclose that it has not based its production decisions on NI 43-101-compliant reserve estimates, preliminary economic assessments, or feasibility studies, and historically projects without such reports have increased uncertainty and risk of economic viability. The Company's decision to place a mine into operation at levels intended by management, expand a mine, make other production-related decisions, or otherwise carry out mining and processing operations is largely based on internal non-public Company data, and on reports based on exploration and mining work by the Company and by geologists and engineers engaged by the Company. The results of this work are evident in the Company's discovery of the San Gonzalo resource, and in the Company's record of mineral production and financial returns since operations at levels intended by management commenced at the San Gonzalo Mine in 2012. This approach is being applied for the advancement of the�Avino�Mine project, for which similar risks and uncertainties have been identified.



Mining

The San Gonzalo Mine is an underground operation that uses both shrinkage stoping and cut and fill mining methods to extract mineralized material.  Once mineralized material has been broken from the stopes, it is transported to the surface and trucked 2 km to the mill where it waits to be processed.

A 250 tonne per day bulk flotation circuit at the processing plant is then used to produce a bulk concentrate that contains silver, gold, lead and zinc. The concentrate is then shipped to Manzanillo, Mexico on a monthly basis where it is sold to a trading company. For more information about the processing plant, please click here

Qualified Person(s)

Avino's projects are under the supervision of Chris Sampson, P.Eng, BSc, ARSM Avino Consultant and Mr. Jasman Yee P.Eng, Avino director, who are both qualified persons within the context of National Instrument 43-101. Both have reviewed and approved the technical data herein

Ride The Silver Bull With Avino Gold & Silver Mines - Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd (NYSEMKT:ASM) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ride The Silver Bull With Avino Gold & Silver MinesJul.19.17 | About: Avino Silver (ASM) Kevin Vlerick Deep Value, contrarian, Gold&Silver, long/short equitySummaryPositioning in silver through a low-cost silver producer.Near-term production growth and catalyst pipeline in the works.Excellent leverage potential for the 'Silver Bull'.Introduction During the correction in the silver price of the last couple of years, many silver miners have been struggling to thrive as profit margins have been razor thin to negative. Some companies, however, have been able to grow significantly despite these market challenges. I would like to present you with my thoughts on one of these companies today, consider its potential going forward, and explain why I see the company as a leveraged bet on the silver price with reasonable downward protection.  Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd., (TSX-V: ASM ǀ NYSE-MKT: ASM ǀ FRANKFURT: GV6) is a Canadian based gold and silver junior mining company with precious metal projects in Canada and Mexico. The company operates two producing mines on its Avino property in Mexico and is currently producing close to 2.7 million silver equivalent ounces per year. At the time of writing, Avino is trading at 1.49 USD per share and holds a market cap of approximately 80 million USD. When observing the chart hereunder, my eyes see underlying strength over the long term. I say this fully aware that a continuation of declining silver prices could drive the stock price considerably lower than it already has since its latest peak of 2016. In my mind, however, this bear market will end, and I consider the current price point an ideal moment to accumulate or initiate a position. 

 Source: Seeking Alpha Why consider Avino Gold & Silver Mines as a leveraged bet on the silver price? Low-cost producer: As described above, the silver price has been in a declining trend, and this decline might continue or not. It's impossible to predict at this point, especially with 'fat finger flash crashes' flying around. Therefore, I find it especially important to find low-cost producers when considering leveraged exposure to the silver market. My strategic thought here is based on my assumption that silver producers with higher all-in sustaining costs per ounce will be hurt first. In the last couple of years, Avino has consistently managed to produce its silver equivalent ounces (AgEq) at around 10 USD all-in sustaining cost per ounce. If Avino can hold production costs at these levels, it offers investors reasonable downward protection in case of declining silver prices and excellent upside potential in a rising price environment. With silver prices currently trading at 16.12 USD per ounce of silver, it effectively allows the company to be profitable and to invest in its growth.

(Source: Avino Corporate Presentation)  Expansion projects to significantly boost production profile over the coming years: While in my opinion, aiming for a low-cost producer is a sound strategy in reducing risk, I personally find a clear path towards production growth another key part in hedging the price you pay for a stock. Avino has various expansion programs in the pipeline which could potentially nearly double its production profile through 2018-2021. In the chart below you will find management’s indication of expected near-term production growth for 2018 and 2019, which tops 4 million AgEq ounces per year. Note that this is mainly based on the completion a current fully funded expansion plan which is underway. This plan will boost output from the Avino mine by 70% from 1,500 TPD (tons per day) to 2,500 TPD by adding a fourth mill circuit on the Avino mine. The Avino mine produced 1.6 million AgEq ounces in 2016. Growing capacity by 70% could roughly add 1.1 million AgEq ounces per year. Whether the company actually reaches the projected 4 million AgEq ounces by 2018 or just stays shy of it, I find the production growth for next year perfectly fitting for my 'positioning' strategy with downward protection. 

(Source: Avino Corporate Presentation)
 Avino is also working hard on advancing its oxide tailings project which could add another 1.2 million ounces of low-cost AgEq production annually for a period of seven years by 2020-2021. While there is still some work to do in de-risking that project, it definitely shows that management is serious about organic growth. The updated PEA (Preliminary Economic Assessment) which was released in April 2017 boasts a Pre-Tax NPV (8%) of 40.5 million USD and a 48.4% IRR. If successful, it would comfortably turn Avino into a 5 million+ AgEq ounce low-cost silver producer. If we consider that market capitalization currently stands at roughly 80 million USD, one can appreciate the potential Avino has. Additionally, the company has been busy in restoring the glorious past of the Bralorne gold mine in Canada. While it is not within the scope of this article to go into a lot of detail on this high-grade gold project, it does show the potential for even more organic growth over the coming years. Management has basically consolidated the land packages of three historic mines and wants to mine the untouched gap zones between those mines and has proposed an initial target to build a 500 TPD operation. Recently, it gave the market a progress update for the Bralorne mine. As an investor, you should stay vigilant about the added risk this property brings as it could become more capital intensive than management is projecting, weigh on the organization, and take resources away from the proper development of the Avino property. For now, I am giving management the benefit of the doubt on this. I will, however, be monitoring closely how it allocates its resources in that respect, and I would hope to see a continuation of drilling on the property in order to increase the known mineral resources of the Avino property. 'Silver Bull', 'Leverage' and 'Positioning': The premise here is that you are at least bullish on silver, and you have the intention to position yourself before a potential resumption of the silver bull market. The key takeaway is that we do not know when the silver price will provide us that leverage, but Avino can provide us significant leverage and downward protection in the near term through its organic growth initiatives that are currently underway. If successful, it would only be a matter of time until the market starts pricing in the progress of the company.
 Final thoughts and disclosure This article is not intended to provide a specific price target for the company. Its intention is to portray a potential leveraged play on the silver price, but I would strongly encourage you to do your own due diligence. I have personally been long on Avino Silver & Gold Mines for a while (2013). While I failed to trade in and out of positions in order to end up with free shares, it has more or less done what I wanted it to do when I initially invested. It protected my capital during the downtrend, grew production significantly, and became a stronger company. I still expect the bear market in silver to be closing in towards its end and find Avino in that respect still one of my favorite vehicles to play a potential upcoming market turn and resumption of a silver bull market. I'm looking forward seeing the company grow even stronger and, if the silver price cooperates over the coming years, truly unlock amazing leverage and value for the patient investor. When investing in small-cap stocks, you should always consider the higher risks involved and the higher volatility of the stock price and the potential total loss of your investment. Your portfolio and investment decisions should be based on your own investment profile and risk appetite.

VANCOUVER, July 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Avino Silver & Gold Mines Ltd. (NYSE-MKT:ASM: TSX.V, ASM; "Avino" or the "Company") announces second quarter 2017 production results from its Avino property near Durango, Mexico.

    --  Silver equivalent production increased by 11% to 698,174 oz*
    --  Gold production increased by 29% to 1,954 oz
    --  Silver production increased by 1% to 386,002oz
    --  Copper production increased by 7% to 1,133,161 lbs




    *For comparison purposes, the

"We are pleased with the 11% increase in production this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year. The results are higher this quarter compared to the same period last year mainly due to the increased mill availability experienced in the second quarter of 2017.
At our current rate of production, we anticipate outputs to be similar in the second half of the year.
We are also very happy with the progression of the plant and mill expansions which will further develop and maintain a solid production profile going forward."

Second Quarter 2017 Highlights

    1. The tonnage processed increased by 20% due to circuits #2 and #3 being
       used exclusively for the processing of the Avino mine material.  The mill
       availability rate increased by 13% over the second quarter of 2016 during
       which time there were mechanical issues with the ball mill of circuit #3.
       In the second quarter we opted to mine by slashing the vein to provide
       mill feed, therefore the mine development decreased by 38%.
    2. Silver and gold feed grades increased by 19% and 106% respectively while
       the copper grade decreased by 10% due to the change in mineralization.
    3. Gold recovery improved by 14% due to the higher feed grade realized,
       while the silver and copper recoveries remained stable with minor changes
       seen.
    4. The higher tonnage processed resulted in 18% more concentrate produced
       although the copper feed grade decreased by 9%.
    5. Gold production increased by 181%, while silver and copper increased by
       43% and 7% respectively.
    6. The higher tonnage processed, together with the higher silver and feed
       grades resulted in 50% more silver equivalent ounces produced.

Second Quarter 2017 Highlights

    1. Tonnage mined and processed decreased by 14% and 41% respectively due to
       circuit #2 being used for the Avino mine material.
    2. The silver in the feed grade increased by 17% whereas the gold grade
       decreased by 10%.
    3. The gold recovery improved by 5% while the silver recovery decreased
       slightly by 2%.
    4. Concentrate tonnage produced also decreased by 42% due to the lower
       tonnage processed and the increased grades of silver and gold in the
       concentrate of 19 and 16% respectively.
    5. The lower tonnage throughput, together with the changes in the feed
       grades and recoveries, resulted in a decrease of silver ounces by 32%,
       gold by 44% and overall silver equivalent by 35%.


Zinc Circuit
Testing of the zinc circuit has been ongoing during the second quarter and the initial results have indicated slight improvements in the San Gonzalo gold and silver recoveries, however the grade of the concentrate has been low.  We will continue with the testing to obtain a marketable product.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control
Mill assays are performed at the Avino property's on-site lab. Check samples are sent to SGS Labs in Durango, Mexico for verification.  All concentrate shipments are assayed by one of the following independent third party labs:  AHK, Inspectorate in the UK, and LSI in the Netherlands.
Qualified Person(s)
Avino's Mexican projects are under the supervision Jasman Yee P.Eng, Avino director, who is a qualified person within the context of National Instrument 43-101. He has reviewed and approved the technical data in this news release.

The Securities Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning "measured mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" or "inferred mineral resources" or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute "reserves" by SEC standards, unless such information is required to be disclosed by the law of the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation or of a jurisdiction in which its securities are traded. U.S. investors should also understand that "inferred mineral resources" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. Disclosure of "contained ounces" is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute "reserves" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.
Neither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

Harvard Economist Harry Dent Warns: “$700 Gold by 2018" | Economy and Markets












































































































Harvard Economist Warns “$700 Gold by 2018″


									By Harry Dent							



Investors are fleeing to gold in a desperate attempt to weather the recent market volatility… but is this long time “safe-haven” actually poised to collapse wiping out trillions of dollars of wealth in the process?
One highly respected Harvard economist is stating an emphatic “yes!”.
“While many economists will argue that gold is not in a bubble… and insist it will soar to $2,000, $5,000 and even $10,000, my research has said otherwise” says Harvard economist Harry Dent in his latest report. “I’ve never been more certain of anything in over 30 years of economic forecasting.”
Market volatility, worries over the Europe Central Bank, negative interest rates, and China are among a laundry list of events that are driving panicked masses to buy the yellow metal. But this is only inflating the gold bubble that is poised to pop at any moment, he says.

Dent, who pioneered a whole new science of economic forecasting in the early 1980’s has been able to accurately predict almost every major economic event over the past 30 years. —including the collapse of Japan, The Great Tech Boom of the 1990’s, and the 2008 market crash.
Now his latest prediction his proving controversial among financial circles across the country.
Traditionally investors flock to gold as a way to hedge against inflation. But according to Dent’s research, we’re about to see the exact opposite happen.
Dent warns that we are about to experience an economic crisis far worse than 2008 — the full-blown collapse of the stock market and massive deflation.
And that investors who attempt to hide their money in the “safe haven” of gold, could damage their wealth to an even greater degree.

This scenario was practically preordained — as far back as the mid-1990s when the bubble in stocks began and real estate followed and Baby Boomers were heading for their peak spending years into 2007.
“When you understand this event, including the fundamental reasons driving it, you need not panic. You will see there’s a tremendous upside to what will unfold over this decade and beyond.” Says Dent. “After all, when you’re able to know what’s coming – and position yourself accordingly – the years ahead could be prosperous times.”

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
