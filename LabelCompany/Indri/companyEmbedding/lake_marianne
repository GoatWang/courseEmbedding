The Most Powerful Women in Business






Nearly half the women on our list run huge companies—a record. And all are working hard to transform their businesses.
By Caroline Fairchild, Beth Kowitt, Colleen Leahey, and Anne VanderMey, with additional reporting by Michal Lev-Ram and Patricia Sellers
More CEOs, more industries, more power, more challenges. That’s the story of Fortune’s 2014 ranking of the 50 Most Powerful Women in ­Business, which features an all-time record of 24 large-company CEOs in its pages. Our women are leading—and in many cases pushing through difficult transformations—in heavy industries such as tech, energy, defense, and autos. Ginni Rometty, No. 1 for the third time running, continues to retool IBM. No. 2, Mary Barra, must fix General Motors from the inside out. And Marillyn Hewson, the CEO of Lockheed Martin and our fourth-ranked woman, is looking beyond defense for growth. Today eight of our top 10 MPW lead large industrial, tech, and consumer products companies.
It’s a long way from our original 1998 list, on which, we noted at the time, most members “came from industries with a premium on creativity,” such as advertising, media, and publishing, with “no top women at blue-chip firms.” Creativity is still a requirement for success, of course, but you no longer have to work in a “creative” industry to advance as a woman. Another common denominator is change: Seven of our top 50 were named to their jobs in the past year, and nine are newcomers to the list. That suggests more turnover at the upper echelons of business—which, it’s fair to say, is a very good thing for a whole lot of powerful women. —Jennifer Reingold

Methodology




The Most Powerful Women in Business list is compiled by FORTUNE editors, who consider four criteria: the size and importance of the woman's business in the global economy, the health and direction of the business, the arc of the woman's career (resume and runway ahead), and social and cultural influence.

Marianne   on 8/12/2001 2:36:00 PM   More reviews by Marianne    Age: 25-29 Skin: Very Dry, Other, Not Sure Hair: Black, Other, Other Eyes: Black     			Just got this, after reading it was the highest rated foundation at misskat.com (Asian beauty site with tons os reviews.)  Wonderful!  I have such dry skin, but this is just fine... it's super smooth and doesn't feel chalky at all!  Not too matte, but not too shiny, which I sometimes felt with the Stila IPF.  The compact is gorgeous (and I can travel with it!), comes with a cloth pouch, and there is a compartment to keep the sponge separate from the product.  Or I use a brush for lighter coverage.  I don't wear much make-up, but this is so fast and looks so natural, it is defn. going to be used up by me!  And it is a God-send in this hot humid weather... Chantecaille just makes such super-quality products.  The only thing that would make this even better is if it had a high SPF.  I am a FS Cream, and Bamboo seems to be a prefect match.hmmm.  it's two weeks later since i wrote the review.  i still love the chantecialle, but i think that my skin is getting paler, b/c the bamboo isn't the same match (i just need to find another one, i hope!).  but it is still wonderful, and i like it better than Stila IPF! continued >>         2 of 2 people found this helpful.

I heard great things about this and finally purchased it a couple of months ago, Petal is my perfect shade and it gives my skin a very natural, polished and airbrushed look to it. I normally apply my foundation as normal and then wear this on top sort of like a finishing powder but it really does add a bit of extra coverage, it isn't cakey even if you apply it with the sponge and the colour match is absolutely perfect.  I'd say that this is imperceptible on the skin to be quite honest with you and I would recommend it to anyone who asked me what good powder compact they should buy.  This, always this.  I did sort of want more coverage mainly because that's what I expected from this but it hasn't let the product down in any way.  It's perfect on top of TM.  The cons are that this is an expensive purchase for sure, and after 2 months of daily use I have already hit pan on it in the very centre which has disappointed me somewhat but also alerted me to the fact that this is a staple in my routine and one that I do not wish to be without.  I have tried other foundations in the past which have sat on top of my skin, not matched very well or looked too obvious and this is just... it's just understated, classic and elegant.  I may even buy a second one to keep in my bag.A little note on the compact:  It gets scruffy looking fairly easily because it's so shiny and beautiful at the start and it's constantly being thrown in my makeup bag, but it is quite expensive looking and pretty - it has a nice mirror and a compartment under the powder with a decent sponge in it - it is the perfect travel companion and looks elegant and beautiful.  I highly doubt i'll be swapping this for anything else anytime soon.  It's on of "those" products.  		     Report Abuse  3 of 3 people found this helpful.         				Cinerem				   on  11/2/2015 9:59:00 PM   More reviews by Cinerem    Age: 19-24 Skin: Combination, Fair, Neutral Hair: Brunette, Wavy, Medium Eyes: Blue     			Chantecaille Compact Makeup was my first foray into more niche/inaccessible high-end makeup. Based on online swatches, I blindly chose the color Petal for my NW10 skin. Petal is neutral with a slight tinge of pink. To date, I have not been able to find a better match for my skin in terms of shade and undertone. The second closest foundation match I've been able to find is the YSL Top Secrets BB Cream in Clear.The foundation powder is housed in a metallic silver moon. It's definitely one of the larger compacts in my collection, and its size is comparable to that of the Shu Uemura Lightbulb Oleo-pact. Like the Lightbulb, the top of the compact is domed, so you can't really stack other things on top of it. I've seen reviews of this product online, and some pictures show it coming in a beautiful drawstring pouch. I ordered this product from Nordstrom about 2 years ago, and it did not come with a pouch. Despite the larger size, I do appreciate Chantecaille's attention to detail with the packaging; the general feeling is one of weighted luxury, and this compact puts my Chanel purchases to shame and gives my Guerlain powders a run for their money. The mirror is generously large, and I'll often use it for touch-ups when I'm on-the-go. The compartment below the powder has venting to allow the thick, plush sponge to dry between uses. The compact snaps shut securely, and I've never had any issues with it opening and wreaking havoc on the contents of my bag.In terms of formula, this is my HG pressed powder foundation. I'd say it sets to a natural matte. Coverage can be built up to almost-but-not-really medium. For me, the main selling point is the enhancement of skin texture; my pores seem smaller and there's a general appearance of smoothness. This overall sense of evenness combined with textural refinement means that a thick layer of spackle isn't required to get a polished look. My skin still looks like skin with both powder brush and sponge application. The powder itself has a creamy texture; when some powders get to that panned state, they crumble even if you look at them the wrong way. That hasn't occurred with this foundation. About 80% of the pan is showing at the moment, and I know I'll be able to use it up to the end.I've made this formula work for me despite skin type fluctuations. I am tremendously clog-prone; this product has never exacerbated my acne and was one of the few products I'd turn to when my skin was being extra temperamental. I used it when I was younger and my skin was considerably oilier. I would still have oil breakthrough after 3 or 4 hours but, given the volume of oil pumped out of my skin (thanks, crappy genetics), this was considerable longevity. Even at the end of a workday, the majority of my foundation would still be in tact with some fading around the chin and nose. I am currently on a course of Accutane, and this foundation still holds its own even though the oil production in my skin has halted. My skin is desert dry but, with an extra layer of moisturizer, only a bit of dryness shows around my mouth at the end of the workday. Anyone who is familiar with the effects of Accutante will know how incredible that is. Overall, if you are seeking a balance of coverage and textural perfection and can stomach the Chantecaille price, I wholeheartedly recommend this foundation. I'm a foundation addict, and I haven't looked twice at another pressed powder since I bought this. 		     Report Abuse  7 of 7 people found this helpful.         				Tgivens				   on  8/28/2015 1:38:00 PM   More reviews by Tgivens    Age: 30-35 Skin: Oily, Fair-Medium, Not Sure Hair: Brown, Other, Other Eyes: Hazel     			Let me just start by saying I have never liked a product enough to write a review. I have been searching for quite some time now for a powder foundation to stand up to my oily skin. I live in Florida and between my oily T-Zone and humidity make up usually melts right off. This powder foundation lasts for a solid 8-9 hours and keeps the oil under control. It is easy and quick to apply. I use a powder brush as it goes on quick and even. This is not a full coverage make up. It goes on light and feels like you don't have any make up on, for me this is a plus. I don't like my face to feel heavy.  Although this is expensive it is well worth it. Not the largest color selection but I was able to wear Dune which worked okay. This brand is also cruelty free which is very important to me. Update 9-4-16 I have not continued to use this makeup. I do still highly recommend it, but the color selection needs to be expanded. Dune is the closest I could find to my skin tone, but looked pink is certain lighting. For a very expensive makeup it needs to be perfect. There is no compromising on a $70 compact.

Deandra				   on  6/27/2015 6:45:00 AM   More reviews by Deandra    Age: 36-43 Skin: Sensitive, Fair, Neutral Hair: Blond, Straight, Medium Eyes: Blue     			This is one of the best powder foundations ever created.  It's excellent.In the store the lighting made it difficult to choose the correct color. I walked out of there with a lovely neutral shade called Bamboo, only to find after two days that it was much too dark for me.  Neiman Marcus was surprisingly very kind and understanding about letting me exchange it for a different color, and I was glad because $66 is a lot to spend on foundation.  Shell ended up being a better match for my skin.  The compact has a mirror in the lid and a hidden compartment with a circular sponge, like Stila's Illuminating Powder Foundation if you were ever a fan of that.  This compact has a more elegant look and feel than Stila's or MAC's, and I guess the higher price tag gets you better packaging.  The compact is so handy.At home I use a brush to apply instead of the sponge because I find I don't need much.  Coverage can be light or medium depending on how you apply.  I've only used it dry.  One of the ladies at NM told me it can be used wet but I have not tried it that way.  This is lighter feeling on the skin than my Bare Escentuals Original Foundation.  I realize BE costs half as much.  But also Chantecaille gives me a better finish and does a better job of hiding flaws. The name sounds French but the powder is made in Italy.  It seems to melt into the skin.  The SA almost put me in Petal when I exchanged Bamboo, but I was afraid that was too light and pinkish.  Delicate rose ivories don't work out for me; they usually wash me out.  If Petal is neutral in different light, it might be right for winter when I am more pale.  Again, it's so hard to tell in the store.  Shell is relatively neutral with a slightly yellow undertone.  Normally I wear it over a sunscreen product that contains titanium dioxide, and I really think Shell blends softly and believably into my skin.  The SA said both colors could work for me.  I am using a powder brush most of the time rather than the sponge and not caking it on.I'm no stranger to powder foundations.  MAC's Studio Fix Powder Foundation is one of my fallback favorites.  But this powder is more finely milled and less...hmm...powdery-looking. Again, Chantecaille is expensive, so you have to decide how much you're willing to spend.  Another selling point that will appeal to some buyers: this powder does not go ghostly on you when photographed.  It's also fragrance-free!I think a great liquid foundation is probably better for my combination sensitive skin when I need more coverage than this.  Sometimes my bare skin looks lovely.  But sometimes I get acne and need to conceal it.  All pressed powders run the risk of adding a zit because of ingredients that hold the powder together in that handy little cake. This foundation is really best for skin that just needs a little help but not a major fix.  For problem skin, there are better choices.My love for a good powder foundation comes from a desire to simplify.  I get busy and when I'm in a hurry, powders are so quick to apply!  For weekend jaunts, a run to the market, or yikes, a surprise visit from a neighbor, I love the convenience of this. I don't always have time to apply primer, deftly blend liquid foundation with a sponge, and follow with finishing powder.  Sometimes I hit the snooze button, you know?  I put a dusting of Chantecaille Compact Makeup on this morning and it's still comfortable on my combination skin at 5pm.  I did touch up twice with MAC Blot Powder in the T zone.Now that I know Shell is my color match, at least in summer, I will probably buy it again after I run out, even though $66 is costly.

It doesn't cover pimples that well, they seem to poke thru, even if you try to cake it. However in saying that it has the best anti-shine staying power ever. I use this on the very humid / hot West Australian days [40+ degress celsius]. If you are looking for a light coverage foundation with great staying power, and have pretty good skin already, this foundation is for you. EDIT: I just picked this up again for the first time in 10 years. It really is specatcular. It's sits so finely milled on my dry skin, and it leaves my skin looking poreless and glassy without sitting in lines. Damn I love it. Petal is a great match for my uber PPP skin. Don't be put off, it applies and wears much lighter than it appears in the pan. Great packaging too. :D However it's not very forgiving on very very dry skin, I wouldn't recommend it for winter wear.

"Shell" is natural on my face, it's almost like I haven't done make up, it just light up complexion, I have both used it with or without a makeup base. I of course prefer a makeup base because in the afternoons, without the help of a makeup base, it falls off (or melt) a bit.I pair it with Dior Radiant Base, this combo light up my face. I look alive. I am happy with the golden micro-shimmer contained Radiant Base and then a thin layer of this Chantecaille, I'm quite happy that I don't look too melty after 8 hours.But note that it is more lean to weak coverage side, I will give it a 3 out of 10 for coverage if 10 is full score. really weak! So for people who don't have good skins conditions - most of us are like that unfortunately, it doesn't cover at all. It highlights the good skin but doesn't help disguise bad skin. You need to have a good base - primer + foundation and then apply this compact, use it alone, it only helps to light up your skin a bit and helps to even out discoloration a little but it doesn't give any coverage.Still a bit drying even Chantecaille claim it's moisturizing, but I don't expect a compact to do the moisturizing work.My skin feels extremely dry so I find this compact isn't too bad.

I love to wear this over my sunscreen.  However, the biggest selling point for me was the shade selection.  I have a very hard time finding foundation colors that match me.  My skintone is in the family of NW20-NW25, but the MAC products look chalky on me.  If you have pink, peach and yellow undertones; and, if you find that most foundations wear too yellow or too pinky beige on you, CHANTECAILLE COMPACT MAKEUP IN PEACH just might work.  It did for me!

But this one is different. The texture is so smooth that it went on my face than disappear yet I can tell all my pores and minor imperfections were covered. And it lasted quite long time - my face was still fresh after a long night going out. It's amazing. I'm NW20 and Peach is perfect for me.

I decided to try Chantecaille Compact makeup after reading the fab reviews here.I bought mine at SpaceNK for, gulp... �47 (approx $70). What a waste of money. This seems to be nothing more than a tinted powder. The shade Cashew is a better colour on me than my HG Chanel (although my DD thought it was a little too light), but the texture feels dry and powdery, accentuating any dry areas and making the skin around my eyes look crepey - ouch! As for coverage, what coverage? I was oily and needed to use a blotting sheet after a couple of hours (at least 5-6 with Chanel). The packaging is bulky and dare I say it, cheap looking.  Having used and loved other Chantecaille products I was really disappointed with this - not to say miffed at my expensive mistake. I'm sticking with Chanel.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.
