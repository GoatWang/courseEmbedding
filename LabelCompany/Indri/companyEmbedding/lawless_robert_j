Lawless, Graduate School of Business, Strategy and Organization Management, Campus Box 419, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0419.AbstractIn this article, Michael Lawless and Robert Fisher propose a conceptual framework for analyzing durable sources of competitive advantage for new products. They assess various components of new product introduction strategies in terms of their degrees of competitive “imitability” (i.e., the ease with which competitors can imitate). The less imitable the component, the more durable the profits it generates. The authors identify seven strategic components based on bodies of research in strategy and promotion, distribution and firm characteristics. By selectively managing these components, an innovating firm can affect a new product's imitability and the duration of returns. Using a “resource mobility” perspective, the authors develop propositions that should lead to a more systematic focus on long-term profits in new product introductions.
