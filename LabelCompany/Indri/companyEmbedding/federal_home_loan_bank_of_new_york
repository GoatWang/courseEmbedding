FHLBNY Careers


Join Our Team!
When you join the Home Loan Bank, you're joining a team of people from diverse backgrounds who are dedicated to helping local communities grow.
 
If you have any questions, please contact careers@fhlbny.com



Who We Are & What We Do
The Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLBank) System is a vehicle for economic stability and growth, comprised of 11 regional wholesale banks that are independently owned and operated. Thousands of U.S. financial institutions rely on the FHLBank System to provide a stable source of funds through all credit cycles to support housing and economic growth.
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY) serves member community lenders throughout New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Our credit, cash management, mortgage finance, and housing programs help our member-lenders extend affordable credit to local communities to buy a house, start or expand a business and create more jobs in the community, or cope with a disaster — the day-in, day-out needs of vital, growing neighborhoods and the people who live and work in them.
As part of our dedicated team, you can help contribute to the American Dream of homeownership and prosperity. We work towards our mission to advance housing opportunity and local community development by maximizing the capacity of community-based member-lenders to serve their markets.
We Care About Our Employees
Although we are a large wholesale liquidity provider, with over $100 billion in assets, we are a relatively small company that operates with only 270 employees — small enough for your work to be known, yet big enough for you to make a difference.

We also offer financial support for continuing education, professional licenses, and certifications in your field of expertise. With a corporate culture that fosters growth and further development, you can build a solid career at our home.

Our company also participates in Habitat for Humanity events, holds fundraisers and drives, and matches employee charitable contributions to non-profit organizations to contribute to the FHLBNY’s mission in a tangible way.

Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion means seeking out the best mix of talent available, eliminating barriers for growth within our company, and providing opportunities and incentives to unlock the full potential of a diverse workforce. We have a strong representation of women and minorities throughout the FHLBNY.

Equal Opportunity Employer

First Home Clubsm(FHC)
The First Home Clubsm (FHC) was launched by the HLB in 1995 to offer an incentive for households with incomes at or below 80% of area median income to save towards the purchase of a new home. The program is a non-competitive set-aside of the HLB’s Affordable Housing Program and is administered through approved members of the HLB.The FHC provides down payment and closing cost assistance by granting $4 in matching funds for each $1 saved in a dedicated account (up to $7,500 in matching funds) to an eligible first-time homebuyer purchasing a home through one of our approved member community lenders.
By offering the FHC in your institution, HLB Members can increase their deposits and mortgage originations and enhance their public relations and their CRA credit.
› Read more about FHC for HLB Members
If you are a first-time homebuyer and would like to participate in the FHC, contact a participating HLB Member so that they can determine eligibility.

1Linksm News and Updates
4/1/15:
1Link Safekeeping Module will be discontinued. The Safekeeping Module in 1Link will be phased out by the Fall. All safekeeping transactions and reporting can be done through the new safekeeping platform 1LinkSKsm.
If you are using the Safekeeping Module and need assistance transitioning to 1LinkSK, please contact our Custody and Pledging Services team at (800) 546-5101 or by e-mail at CustodyandPledgingServices@FHLBNY.com.
The new 1LinkSK platform offers members even more than the legacy 1Link Safekeeping Module. This new online platform includes intuitive self-service features that provide your institution’s authorized users with the opportunity to:

Perform trades,
Create Pledge transactions,
View “real-time” monitoring of account activity, and
Customize reports and delivery methods.

Also for your convenience, the following 1Link reports are now available on 1LinkSK:

Custody Daily Income Projections
Daily Asset Holding with Factors
MBS P&I Payments
Monthly Asset Holding Positions
Municipal Security Pledge Report

 

Did you know you can transact with the FHLBNY remotely via 1Link?
Remote access can come in handy during the winter season. Through 1Link, your institution’s authorized users have the ability to obtain account balances and perform business transactions (Advances, Wire Transfers, Book Wires, and Safekeeping transactions) from alternate worksites.
Please note: For business transactions, the user will need their Security Device in their possession. The alternate worksite computer must meet the minimum system requirements to access 1Link. Should you encounter any issues when attempting to access 1Link, contact the 1Link Helpdesk at (800) 546-5101.

About Us
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY) helps community lenders in New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands advance housing and community growth. The FHLBNY is part of the congressionally chartered, nationwide Federal Home Loan Bank System, which was created in 1932 to provide a flexible credit liquidity source for member community lenders engaged in home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The FHLBNY increases the availability of mortgages and home finance to families of all income levels by offering high-value correspondent and cash management services to assist our members in more effectively serving their neighborhoods and meeting their Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities.
Our Mission
The mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York is to advance housing opportunity and local community development by supporting members in serving their markets.
The FHLBNY meets our mission by providing our members with access to economical wholesale credit and assistance through our credit products, mortgage finance program, housing and community lending programs, and correspondent services to increase the availability of home finance to families of all incomes.
How We Lend Money
FHLBNY credit products enhance the financial strength of local lenders, providing them with a reliable source of liquidity at competitive prices so they in turn can help meet the housing finance and credit needs of their communities. Since the FHLBNY is a secured lender, all of our credit products require collateral to maintain our positions as a accessible and cost effective source of credit for members. Collateral can take the form of securities, residential or multi-family mortgages, or in some cases, commercial real estate.
How We Help All Communities
The FHLBNY enables local lenders to extend affordable credit to their communities. Thanks to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, communities across the country have access to more affordable housing, small business, and community development programs.
How We Help Low-Income Communities
Each year since 1990, the FHLBNY has contributed 10% of its income to the Affordable Housing Program (AHP). This program subsidizes long-term financing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families. The FHLBNY also offers Community Lending Programs and the First Home Clubsm, a grant program for first-time homebuyers.
The Federal Home Loan Bank System

There are 11 district banks within the Federal Home Loan Bank System, located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Des Moines, Indianapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Topeka, altogether having a membership of over 8,000 financial institutions.
The Federal Home Loan Banks are all privately capitalized and operated by their member stockholders. They receive no taxpayer funding and raise their funds by issuing debt instruments in the capital markets.
The System is supervised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which ensures that the Federal Home Loan Banks operate in a financially safe and sound manner, remain adequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets, and carry out their housing finance mission.

	Insurance Companies and the Federal Home Loan Banks - A Growing Relationship












































    Insurance Companies and the Federal Home Loan Banks - A Growing Relationship







  You have a vision for your financial future, our partnership can play a key role to help get you there.   
 








Insurance companies play a key role within the U.S. housing market. The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY) promotes housing and economic development by providing low-cost, flexible liquidity to member financial institutions. This closely aligns with our insurance company members’ significant investments and participation in the mortgage market along with their economic development initiatives. Our insurance company members count on us to be a reliable and stable source of liquidity in any market condition.
Membership and advances by insurance companies have increased exponentially as more and more realize the integral role the FHLBNY plays to insurers looking to converge liquidity and working capital needs (as shown in the chart to the right). Overall, the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLBanks) has close to 400 insurance company members, while the percentage of all FHLBanks borrowings by insurance companies has quadrupled between 2007 and 2016.
Insurance companies typically capitalize on their membership to satisfy contingent and strategic funding needs, in addition to financing capital, acquisition costs, and new facilities. This enables them to manage their liquidity positions and obtain affordable financing to support lending, investing, daily operations and grow their business in order to support the housing markets and the communities they serve.
Since the FHLBNY is structured as a cooperative, our members are shareholders. Over the last five years the FHLBNY paid an average dividend of 4.50% — the largest payout by an FHLBank over that time period. This high performance is a testament to our dedication to provide value to our members.

Opportunity for NJ Credit Unions — Municipal Letters of Credit (MULOCs) Credit unions are now eligible to act as public depositories under New Jersey law, and therefore are able to use our MULOC product. MULOCs are a more efficient way to use capital to generate higher returns. Using this type of Letter of Credit frees up your institution’s assets for liquidity reporting or other lending purposes that provide a higher yield.

President's Report
July 3, 2012
At the Bank
Changes, Challenges, and Proven Support
A recent item in The Kiplinger Letter highlighted a big challenge facing automakers: convincing young buyers that cars still matter. According to the article, “a quarter of driving-age folks under 35 don’t even have a license.”
Those of us who will spend this week stuck in July 4th traffic may laugh at this, but there is substantial evidence that younger consumers are driving fewer miles, moving to cities and relying on mass transit. Last week, the Census Bureau released data that showed that, from 2010 to 2011, cities grew at faster rate than suburbs. Metro areas with at least one million residents grew by 1.1% over this period, as compared to an increase of 0.9% for suburbs. When compared side-by-side, the numbers do not seem that far apart. But considering how suburbs expanded at triple the rate of cities over the last decade, it represents a significant shift for our nation.
Our economy, which continues to struggle, and weak job growth, which limits opportunities previously found outside city centers, are the leading causes of this urban expansion. But the housing market and new opinions on homeownership certainly factor into this shift, too. The community lender is now faced with a challenge similar to that confronting automakers: convincing young consumers that the home still matters.
The community banker knows that the home still matters, not as the quick investment opportunity that many saw it as in the run-up to the recession, but as a stable foundation from which to build a life. And as a commissioner on the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Housing Commission, I have had the opportunity to work alongside many housing experts and policymakers who share my belief in the importance of homeownership. But in recent weeks, as I have spent more time in Washington discussing these issues, it has become abundantly clear that a fundamental change in how our housing finance system operates is happening. Of course, change, in itself, is not a strategy. At the Home Loan Bank, our challenge is responding to this change and determining where our members want us to be for you as you, too, respond to these changes.
Over the past 80 years, our economy has been faced with daunting challenges and significant change. But the Home Loan Banks have risen to meet every challenge and adapted to each change, and, eight decades after our inception, remain key support beams for our nation’s lending framework. I have every belief that, regardless of what the future holds for our nation’s economy, the community lender will remain a vital part of responsible housing finance, and your Home Loan Bank will be there to offer our consistent and proven support every step of the way.
I am sure that as you read this, you are thinking about the changes you have already seen in your business, as well as those you anticipate on the horizon. Throughout the year, the Home Loan Bank will conduct a series of outreach efforts to promote a better awareness and understanding of these changes. But remember, you can provide feedback anytime through email, letter or conversation with your calling officer. All of us at the Home Loan Bank, from each member of the staff to every Director on our Board, are interested in hearing your opinion about the changes you see in your marketplace, both now and in the future.
Advances Average $65.1 Billion in May 2012
Advances are the main tool Home Loan Banks use to support our members.  And in May, our members had $65 billion in advances put to work in their communities.  As long as markets remain open, and a member has pledged sufficient qualifying collateral and is willing to purchase the requisite amount of capital stock, the Home Loan Bank will always continue to lend to our members to help you meet your community’s needs.  But as you know better than anyone, a community’s needs are always changing.  And, as you also know, the Home Loan Bank offers many services to our members to help you respond to these needs.  Our Community Investment Programs can be used to help drive job growth and economic development at the local level.  Our Affordable Housing Program helps our members respond to those in their communities who need the most help.  Our triple-A-rated Letters of Credit can be used by members to collateralize a wide range of items, including municipal deposits.  And our Mortgage Partnership Finance® Program provides a competitive secondary market alternative for our membership.  By taking advantage of any or all of these options, Home Loan Bank members are well-positioned to meet the challenges of a changing economic environment.
In Washington
Office of Inspector General Report
The “unsecured lending” transactions referenced in the OIG report are actually “Fed Funds” transactions executed among domestic banks, domestic branches of foreign banks, and federal agencies; at the New York Bank, these transactions are usually done on an overnight basis. Typical of financial institutions, we participate in the Fed Funds market largely for liquidity purposes, as these excess funds enable us to renew advance maturities and pay off upcoming debt maturities in the event of a market disruption. This activity is not absolutely risk-free, nor is the alternative costless. Excess funds left in our reserve account at the Federal Reserve do not earn interest. As a result, we balance the various risks in line with the Bank’s low-risk appetite.
We have always been highly selective with regard to the financial institutions with which we engage in these overnight transactions. These institutions are under constant internal review, and if an institution does not meet our strict criteria, we have strategies and procedures in place to swiftly eliminate corresponding risk exposures. While we do engage in Fed Funds transactions with foreign banks located in the United States, we only deal with the strongest banking entities from governments with solid underlying economic fundamentals, and the domestic branches of foreign banks own a sizable portion of U.S. assets and are subject to Federal Reserve regulations. Accordingly, our activities with regards to Fed Funds transactions reflect our commitment to strong risk management across the Bank.
This week, we celebrate our nation’s birthday. Across the country, people will spend their holiday at a backyard barbecue with family; or in a pick-up softball game in the park with friends; or shoulder-to-shoulder with neighbors for a parade through town. However we choose to celebrate, in no small way, the local lender helps it happen. You are as vital a part of the community as our friends, families and neighbors. And as we move through another year of our country’s history, it is important that we make sure that the local lender remains part of our future.
I wish you all the best this holiday.
 
Sincerely,
Alfred A. DelliBovi
President and CEO

NYBA Member Banks Step Up to Help in Aftermath of Sandy

Posted on November 5, 2012  by  New York Bankers Association 


As the rebuilding and recovery efforts in the storm-ravaged states move into high gear, several NYBA member banks are announcing a wide range of programs designed to help, from donations to the American Red Cross to Small Business Loans. (This list is not comprehensive.)
 Wells Fargo’s 12,000 ATMs nationwide are able to accept donations for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund through November 13.  In addition, Wells Fargo will donate $1 million for relief efforts.  The bank has expanded its mobile deposit services to customers in impacted areas.  In terms of fees, Wells Fargo has extended its waiver of certain loan fees and credit card late payment fees until to November 7 in areas impacted by the hurricane. The bank has also waived the fee it normally charges its customers for using another bank’s ATMs. In some states, customers are will be allowed to withdraw funds from CDs without incurring an early withdrawal penalty. Wells Fargo has initiated an emergency personal loan program for customers in FEMA-designated disaster counties in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York.
Citi is broadening its already expanded services to customers in the impact zone by waiving late fees for 90 days on mortgage payments and a temporary suspension of foreclosure sales in the FEMA disaster areas.  The bank is continuing to waive the following fees through at least November 5: overdraft protection, non-sufficient funds, wiring funds to Citi customers, late payment for credit products, and early withdrawal of CD funds for recovery use.

About Us
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY) helps community lenders in New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands advance housing and community growth. The FHLBNY is part of the congressionally chartered, nationwide Federal Home Loan Bank System, which was created in 1932 to provide a flexible credit liquidity source for member community lenders engaged in home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The FHLBNY increases the availability of mortgages and home finance to families of all income levels by offering high-value correspondent and cash management services to assist our members in more effectively serving their neighborhoods and meeting their Community Reinvestment Act responsibilities.
Our Mission
The mission of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York is to advance housing opportunity and local community development by supporting members in serving their markets.
The FHLBNY meets our mission by providing our members with access to economical wholesale credit and assistance through our credit products, mortgage finance program, housing and community lending programs, and correspondent services to increase the availability of home finance to families of all incomes.
How We Lend Money
FHLBNY credit products enhance the financial strength of local lenders, providing them with a reliable source of liquidity at competitive prices so they in turn can help meet the housing finance and credit needs of their communities. Since the FHLBNY is a secured lender, all of our credit products require collateral to maintain our positions as a accessible and cost effective source of credit for members. Collateral can take the form of securities, residential or multi-family mortgages, or in some cases, commercial real estate.
How We Help All Communities
The FHLBNY enables local lenders to extend affordable credit to their communities. Thanks to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, communities across the country have access to more affordable housing, small business, and community development programs.
How We Help Low-Income Communities
Each year since 1990, the FHLBNY has contributed 10% of its income to the Affordable Housing Program (AHP). This program subsidizes long-term financing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income families. The FHLBNY also offers Community Lending Programs and the First Home Clubsm, a grant program for first-time homebuyers.
The Federal Home Loan Bank System

There are 11 district banks within the Federal Home Loan Bank System, located in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Dallas, Des Moines, Indianapolis, New York, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Topeka, altogether having a membership of over 8,000 financial institutions.
The Federal Home Loan Banks are all privately capitalized and operated by their member stockholders. They receive no taxpayer funding and raise their funds by issuing debt instruments in the capital markets.
The System is supervised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which ensures that the Federal Home Loan Banks operate in a financially safe and sound manner, remain adequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets, and carry out their housing finance mission.

NEW YORK, April 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY") today released its unaudited financial highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.   
"As we move through 2017, we remain a proven partner for our members, as reflected by advances levels of more than $100 billion in the first quarter," said José R. González, president and CEO of the FHLBNY. "As a dependable partner for our members, reliability is at the center of all that we do."








Highlights from the first quarter of 2017 include:

Net income for the quarter was $69.6 million, a decrease of $13.8 million, or 16.5 percent, from net income of $83.4 million for the first quarter of 2016.  This decrease was driven by a one-time charge of $70 million to settle all claims related to the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy.  The FHLBNY believes that the settlement is in the best interest of its franchise and its cooperative, as it removes the uncertainty presented by litigation.  Return on average equity ("ROE") for the quarter was 3.75 percent (annualized), compared to ROE of 5.1 percent for the first quarter of 2016.   
Excluding the Lehman settlement, net income for the quarter would have been $132.6 million, an increase of $49.2 million or 58.9 percent, from net income of $83.4 million for the first quarter of 2016.  First quarter 2017 results, excluding the settlement, were driven by higher advances balances, higher market interest rates and favorable interest rate spreads.  
As of March 31, 2017, total assets were $141.8 billion, a decrease of $1.8 billion, or 1.3 percent, from total assets of $143.6 billion at December 31, 2016.  This decline in total assets was driven primarily by lower advances balances during the period.  As of March 31, 2017, advances were $101.4 billion, a decrease of $7.9 billion, or 7.2 percent, from $109.3 billion at December 31, 2016.  
As of March 31, 2017, total capital was $7.3 billion, a decrease of $0.3 billion from total capital of $7.6 billion at December 31, 2016.  The FHLBNY's retained earnings decreased during the quarter by $17.4 million to $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2017, of which $994.5 million was unrestricted retained earnings and $400.1 million was restricted retained earnings.  At March 31, 2017, the FHLBNY met its regulatory capital ratios and liquidity requirements.

The FHLBNY currently expects to file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on or before May 12, 2017.

Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Map of FHLB territories. As of 2015, territory formerly covered by the Seattle bank is now covered by the Des Moines bank.


The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide reliable liquidity to member financial institutions (not individuals) to support housing finance and community investment. With their members, the FHLBanks represents the largest collective source of home mortgage and community credit in the United States.

9.1 Banks





Overview[edit]
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932 and has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products and services that assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions and insurance companies. Each FHLBank is required to register at least one class of equity with the SEC, although their debt is not registered.
A primary benefit of FHLBank membership is access to reliable liquidity through secured loans, known as advances, which are funded by the FHLBanks in the capital markets from the issuance of discount notes or term debt, collectively known as consolidated obligations (COs). COs are joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks, i.e., any debt issued on behalf of one FHLBank is the responsibility of all for repayment, with the issuing FHLBank having the primary responsibility. The Office of Finance (OF) serves as the fiscal agent for the FHLBanks, with responsibility for offering, issuing and servicing COs, as well as preparing the combined financial reports.[1] Although the individual FHLBanks are SEC registrants, the FHLBank System is not. Thus, the FHLBank System financial reports are properly viewed as “combined” rather than “consolidated.”
Ownership[edit]
The 11 banks of the FHLBank System are owned by over 7,300 regulated financial institutions from all 50 states, U.S. possessions, and territories. Equity in the FHLBanks is held by these owner/members and is not publicly traded. Institutions must purchase stock in order to become a member. In return, members obtain access to low-cost funding, and also receive dividends based on their stock ownership. The FHLBanks are self-capitalizing in that as members seek to increase their borrowing, they must first purchase additional stock to support the activity. FHLBanks are exempt from all corporate federal, state, and local taxation, except for local real estate tax. The capital investments in FHLBanks receive preferential risk-weighting exemption treatment from the Basel II rules (which would normally require non-traded equity investments to be risk-weighted at 400%, but the exemption allows only 100%). The FHLBanks pay an assessment of 10% of annual earnings for affordable housing programs. The mission of the FHLBanks reflects a public purpose (increase access to housing and aid communities by extending credit to member financial institutions), but all 11 are privately capitalized and, apart from the tax privileges, do not receive taxpayer assistance.
Financial results and condition[edit]
On March 27, 2015, the FHLBanks Office of Finance published the 2014 Combined Financial Report.[2] For 2014, the FHLBanks recorded net income of $2,245 million. Combined assets of the FHLBanks were $913.3 billion as of December 31, 2014. Of this total, advances equaled $571 billion. Investments were the second largest component at $267 billion. Mortgage loans held for portfolio were $44 billion. The FHLBanks made affordable housing contributions of $269 million in 2014.
The principal assets of the FHLBanks are advances (secured loans to members), mortgage loans held for portfolio, and other investments. The FHLBanks are required by regulation to hold collateral in excess of the actual loan amount for any given borrower. The FHLBanks are funded through the daily sale of debt securities in the global capital markets. All 11 FHLBanks are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities of each individual FHLBank. Since August 2006, all 11 Banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC web site (EDGAR). (See external links)
At December 31, 2014, each of the FHLBanks was in compliance with its statutory minimum capital requirements[3] and the FHLBank System as a whole is above its minimum capital requirements.
On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank’s outstanding consolidated obligations.[4]
History[edit]
As a result of the Great Depression the FHLBanks were established by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. This was in order to provide funds to "building and loan" institutions, providing liquidity and making mortgages available.
As a result of the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also allowed all federally insured depository institutions to join the FHLBank System, including commercial banks and credit unions.
As a result of the late-2000s financial crisis the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. On September 7, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced a new credit facility for the three housing government-sponsored enterprises. This enabled the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase FHLBank debt in any amount subject to the pledging of advances and other assets as collateral. The authority for this facility expired on December 31, 2009.
As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress) - a bill that would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured credit unions as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.[7][8] This change would make such credit unions "eligible for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System."[9]

As a result of the late-2000s recession, section 312 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act mandated merger of OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) as of July 21, 2011.
On July 31, 2014, it was announced that the Federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and Des Moines were discussing a potential merger.[5] The merger was completed on June 1, 2015.[6]
Related legislation[edit]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
