$7,000,000 Settlement  - Asbestos
Estate of Asbestos Victim Awarded $6.8 Million Dollars: with Pre-Trial Settlements Total Reaches $7.78 Million Dollars
Patrick J. Bartels represented a young man, Vincent Acceturo, Jr., who had been employed as a heavy truck mechanic with Penske Trucking in Linden, NJ during the mid 1980s. Part of his job was repairing and replacing braking systems in large trucks such as International Harvester, Freightliner, and Mack. The replacement brake linings he worked with contained high percentages of asbestos fiber. The company responsible for supplying the asbestos-containing brake linings to Penske was Combined Automotive, Inc., out of Hillside, New Jersey. In May of 1999, Mr. Acceturo, then 33 years old, was diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma, a very rare lung cancer uniquely associated with exposure to asbestos. He died on August 19, 1999 at the age of 34.
A lawsuit was filed by his widow in Middlesex County, New Jersey on June 30, 1999. The lawsuit named the manufacturers and suppliers of the asbestos materials to which Mr. Acceturo was exposed while working at Penske. Combined Automotive was named as a defendant on March 17, 2005. The owner of Combined Automotive was deposed and ultimately chose not to defend the claims made by Mr. Acceturo. Default Judgment was entered against Combined Automotive on September 12, 2008. On April 21, 2009 a proof hearing was held before the Honorable Ann G. McCormick, J.S.C., Middlesex County Superior Court, New Jersey. Prior to the proof hearing, the plaintiff reached settlements with several defendants in the amount of $960,750.00. On September 2, 2010, she returned a verdict against Combined Automotive in the amount of $6,818,395.27 which includes pre-judgment interest, bringing the total monetary damages to $7,779,145.27.

$2,000,000 Verdict  - Asbestis
$2.1 Million Jury Verdict for New Jersey Asbestos Victim
 
A 67 year old Franklin Township man who suffered serious lung disease as a result of exposure to asbestos was awarded $2.1 million against the Owens Corning Fiberglass which was partially responsible for the serious injuries the plaintiff sustained. Counsel for the plaintiff, Patrick Bartels, proved at trial he suffered asbestos induced lung cancer after years of exposure to asbestos pipe insulation. As a result he is forced to breathe with the help of an oxygen tank up to 16 hours a day.

A 67 year old Franklin Township man who suffered serious lung disease as a result of exposure to asbestos was awarded $2.1 million against the Owens Corning Fiberglass which was partially responsible for the serious injuries the plaintiff sustained. Counsel for the plaintiff, Patrick Bartels, proved at trial he suffered asbestos induced lung cancer after years of exposure to asbestos pipe insulation. As a result he is forced to breathe with the help of an oxygen tank up to 16 hours a day.
