Freshness from 
        Start to Finish!
Violetta grilled and 
        fire roasted vegetables are a result of cutting edge technology that eliminates 
        the tedious process of washing, slicing, dicing, and cooking.
We start with the 
        freshest vegetables that are sliced or diced to your specifications, and 
        roasted over an open flame to seal in the natural juices. They are grilled 
        to perfection to ensure a bright, tender, and consistently sweet tasting 
        product. Our vegetables are immediately I.Q.F. flash frozen, so that each 
        individual piece retains its color, texture, and full flavor.
Explore the wonderful 
        world of flavors! To further distinguish our complete line of grilled 
        and fire roasted vegetables, a signature blend of seasonings  Sante 
        Fe, Tuscany and Mesquite  can also be added. For

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Comarco Inc., of Irvine, Calif., is voluntarily recalling to replace about 125,000 detachable plugs on power adapters.

The black adapters have a model name of "Targus" and model number of PA-AC- 70W-2, which can be found on a label on the back of the adapter. The name "Targus" also appears in white letters on the front of the adapter. The adapters were manufactured in the United States.

Major retail stores nationwide sold the adapters between July 2002 and March 2003 for between $90 and $120.

Consumers should stop using the AC plugs immediately and contact Comarco to obtain a free replacement plug. Consumers should contact Comarco collect at (949) 599-7400 between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. CT Monday through Friday or log on to the company's website at www.regcen.com/comarco.
 





The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

CPSC, Comarco Inc. Announce Recall to Replace Detachable Plugs On Power Adapters






























Note: The firm has a new phone number.






FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
			March 20, 2003
			Release # 03-097

Comarco Recall Hotline: (949) 599-7400
			CPSC Media Contact: Scott Wolfson, (301) 504-7051



 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Comarco Inc., of Irvine, Calif., is voluntarily recalling to replace about 125,000 detachable plugs on power adapters. The plug can break open and expose live wires, posing an electrocution or electric shock hazard to consumers.

Comarco has received 12 reports of the plugs breaking open, though no injuries have been reported.

The recalled AC plugs, which were sold with 70-watt AC power adapters, have the word "ChargeSource" printed on top of the plug. The black adapters have a model name of "Targus" and model number of PA-AC- 70W-2, which can be found on a label on the back of the adapter. The name "Targus" also appears in white letters on the front of the adapter. The adapters were manufactured in the United States.

Major retail stores nationwide sold the adapters between July 2002 and March 2003 for between $90 and $120.

Consumers should stop using the AC plugs immediately and contact Comarco to obtain a free replacement plug. Consumers should contact Comarco collect at (949) 599-7400 between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. CT Monday through Friday or log on to the company's website at www.regcen.com/comarco.
 





The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.
