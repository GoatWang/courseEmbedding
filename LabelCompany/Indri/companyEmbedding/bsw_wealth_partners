Why We Do It - BSW Wealth Partners: Colorado's Leading Wealth Advisory Firm

We Make Life Better for BSW clients, staff, and their families.

Make Life BetterMessage From The FounderWho We Serve











  















				Make Life Better			










 










Our Ethos: BSW is an independent multi-family office and wealth advisory firm that is Built To Last and Makes Life Better for current and future clients, staff, and their families. 




At BSW, our manifesto is Make Life Better, you’ll see it in all we do. At the end of the day, we all want to live lives full of meaning, abundance, adventure, and fulfillment. Money and wealth are really just wampum – a store of value we trade for those qualities. What we do goes beyond just investments or financial planning. We work side-by-side with our clients so that their wealth empowers and enhances all aspects of their lives.





message from the founderDebi Baydush


THE LIFE, EVOLUTION, AND SPIRIT OF OUR COMPANY 




When I was very young, my mother asked only that I do my best. I took that message to heart and set out to prove to my grandfather and great-uncle that it wasn’t necessary to be a man to succeed in business and investing. My experience with big brokerage houses motivated me to create a client-centric firm that provided fee-only objective advice. A strong independent streak and lessons learned from raising three children drove a firm culture that values being smart, exercising compassion and, critically important, having fun.
Gratifyingly – BSW mirrors that ambition, providing a best in class experience for clients, colleagues, and employees; a fee-only model to ensure objectivity; and carefully guided conversation that engages, challenges and nurtures individuals to tune out noise, identify goals, then build a plan to achieve them.
Perhaps easier said than done. But I do know that having the right partner creates a safe space for honesty. Thoughtful discussion gives rise to new awareness. The dots connect and the endgame comes into sharp focus. I myself know the truth of this because two years ago I realized my life-long dream of a ranch in the mountains, off the grid, where I live with the freedom to wander where I will (in the buff if I please!) with just the occasional moose or bear to see me. Having your dreams come true is better than you might imagine and something I hope all of our clients and staff will experience. Here’s to BSW continuing as a critical partner on the journey to identify and manifest life’s full potential.















  

















Our Client Families 





We build enduring, fiercely loyal, and collaborative relationships. 




BSW works with all kinds of families, with specialty practice areas in Impact Investing, Entrepreneurs, Medical Professionals, and Divorcees. We have the best clients. Successful, yet humble. Driven, yet kind. Adventurous, yet pragmatic. They’ve climbed Everest, sailed around the world, and started many of the companies that are synonymous with Boulder. It’s a privilege to work with and for them through major life events, including marriage, children (and grandchildren!), starting and selling companies – and tough times like death, divorce, and life transitions. BSW engagements endure – from the firm’s inception in 1992 and through multiple generations. How can we Make Life Better for you?

BSW IMPACT REPORT










  


















We are all investors and how we choose to allocate our investments of time, money, energy, and effort profoundly affect our world. 



Impact investing is generally defined as integrating social and environmental factors into investment decisions. This intersection of entrepreneurship, business, and impact is the most important trend in finance today and has the power to tackle our most pressing social and environmental problems.
As a pioneer in impact investing, we view values-based strategies as the natural intersection between philanthropic giving and investing. Our capabilities in this area span all major asset classes and values-based strategies including screening for environmental sustainability, economic empowerment, and healthy communities.
We believe in maximizing all returns for our investors, stakeholders, and our world.




Learn more about R3 RETURNS, our Impact Municipal Bond strategy featured in the Colorado Impact Days showcase.  Due to its great success, BSW was prompted to launch R3 into a separately managed account for other advisors and their clients.

They are the gold standard for stellar work environments allowing their employees to feel empowered whether they are in or out of the office. Employees are mentored toward reaching their personal goals, whether that’s climbing a mountain, skiing down one, or saving a certain sum. The snack cabinet is stocked, and winter means ski days. Employees also get paid time off for volunteer service, a chance for partial ownership in the company, and time for weekly meditation.
BSW Makes Life Better for clients, staff, and their families. BSW aspires to be a leader in the B Corp movement and hopes to inspire others to follow suit.

Elias joined the firm in late 2009 as an Investment Advisor.

It seems like another lifetime but he has fond memories of running mountain biking camps for Boulder-based Dirt Camp.

Benjamin Weaver (CRD# 2900111)
 
Ben is an Advisor and managing principal of BSW Wealth Partners. In this role, he helps our clients solve problems and grow money by developing objective “big picture” strategies, communicating them clearly, and ensuring that they are implemented and monitored appropriately. He spent several years in the portfolio management world, but now focuses time primarily in the development and coordination of advantageous retirement, tax, investment, and estate planning strategies. Along these lines, he spends most of his time understanding client goals, and then coordinating efforts within BSW, as well as with other trusted professionals, to liberate clients and achieve their goals.
 
Prior to joining BSW in 1997, Ben worked on the equity trading desk at Schwab Institutional. He is a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional and earned a BA in Economics from the University of Richmond.
 
Before settling into his financial career, Ben was a fly fishing guide and powderhound in Steamboat Springs for five years. Outside of the office, his passions remain telemark skiing, fly fishing, and now, above all, family: wife Lucy and daughters Carson and Jesse.

Timothy Wojtalik (CRD# 5148474)
Tim is an Advisor and managing principal of BSW Wealth Partners.

It’s within this framework that he finds satisfaction by being both a partner and resource through the journey.
Tim earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he studied Organizational Psychology and English – a combination that often revealed why people do what they do! He has an MBA from the University of Denver and holds the CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ professional designation.
Outside the office, Tim’s family, his wife Laura and two children Zack and Audrey, and their English Lab, Routt, are his priorities. Together, they race triathlons, play in the mountains, and travel. One of his favorite outside of work activities is to “cruise” the world with his family, an opportunity to experience the world economy in person!
