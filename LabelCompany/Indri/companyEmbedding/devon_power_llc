Interest Owners





Keeping You Informed In our more than 40 years of doing business, we have valued our relationships with our royalty owners  and understand you may have questions from time to time. To make it easier for you to get the information you need quickly and conveniently, we have established a section on our website to address your needs directly.

The website provides information about whom to contact if you have a particular question. The website also offers access to your owner account and the important forms you need along with an overview of how to read your check details. We also offer a section of frequently asked questions.

Our Make a Difference section on the website allows us to keep you informed on legislation and industry issues that affect the oil and gas industry, which may also affect you. We hope you will use this site as a reference for your royalty owner needs as well as a resource for the latest on industry topics that affect us all.


 
How do I enroll to have my revenues directly deposited into my bank account?

Devon offers a direct deposit payment option for its interest owners. It is safe, secure and offers many advantages, including: No cost to you.No postal delays of your check.No unnecessary trips to the bank.No lost, damaged or stolen checks.If traveling, your revenues are still deposited in your bank account. When you sign up for direct deposit, you will receive regular payment deposits in your bank account on the 17th of each month (or the next business day if the 17th falls on a weekend or bank holiday) if you are due payment, and a payment remittance advice will be sent to your designated mailing address. To sign up for direct deposit, download and complete the form located at www.devonenergy.com, Interest Owners, Forms and Documents. Please make sure all applicable parties on your Devon account sign the form. Return the form by email to SAPVendorCustomerMaintenance@dvn.com or mail or fax the form to:  Devon Energy Corp.Attn: Accounting Data and Process - ACH Processing 333 West Sheridan Avenue Oklahoma City, OK 73102-5015Fax - 405-234-2396

Why do I need to contact Division Orders?

Each situation is unique, and our Division Order department will be able to give you specific instruction on what to provide for instances related to new owner set-up and ownership changes. Informing Devon of all necessary changes related to deaths or any other situations regarding ownership interest as you become aware of them will eliminate unnecessary delays. If you have any questions about name changes due to getting married or divorced, putting your interest into a trust or transferring your ownership to someone else or if there is a change in trustee, call Devon Direct at 405-228-4800.

I noticed that backup withholding was deducted from my revenue check. Why?


	Devon is required by the Internal Revenue Service to withhold 28 percent of all revenue payments to U.S. residents if the taxpayer ID number (or Social Security number) is missing or invalid. The number provided must match the name on the payment as indicated per IRS records. This information is required to be provided to Devon in writing. All backup withholding is reported on your 1099 at year-end, and it is considered a payment to the IRS on your behalf. Devon does not issue refunds for backup withholding. Royalty owners are able to report the withholding on their income tax returns at the end of the year. If you need to notify us of your valid Tax ID or Social Security number, please contact the Devon Direct team at 405-228-4800.

I haven’t received my payment. What should I do?


	If your check is more than two weeks late, contact Devon Direct at 405-228-4800. You may be required to submit a written authorization to stop payment and re-issue the check. Once we place a stop payment on your check, it will be voided in our system and will no longer be honored by Devon. To avoid postal delays, you may want to consider direct deposit for your payment.


I found a stale-dated check. How do I get it re-issued?


	Devon automatically voids and re-issues checks that are not cashed or deposited in 90 days. It is important that you cash your checks regardless of the amount prior to the 90-day mark. If you find a check after the 90-day mark, call 405-228-4800. You may want to consider direct deposit for your payment.


What do I do if a stop payment has been placed on my check?


	Monies will be issued to you in the next available check process. Once we place a stop payment on your check, please do not attempt to cash the check. The check will be voided in our system and will no longer be honored by Devon. You may want to consider direct deposit for your payment.


Why does my payment amount change?


	Changing market conditions can cause price fluctuations, while mechanical or operational problems or routine maintenance may temporarily affect production, causing downtime. If you have reason to believe an error has occurred, call 405-228-4800.

When is my Joint Interest Billing (JIB) Statement processed?


	Joint Interest Billing statements are generally processed and mailed on the fourth and fifth workday of the following month. If you are missing your JIB statement, you can view and print all your statements free of charge through a secure site located at www.energylink.com. Call 405-228-4800 for assistance in retrieving your statement(s).

Where should my JIB payments be sent?

Joint Interest Billing (JIB) Payments should be mailed to:Devon Energy Production Co. LP P.O. Box 842485 Dallas, TX 75284-23485

When should I expect my 1099?


	1099s are mailed on Jan. 31 of each year. If you do not receive your 1099 by Feb. 16 or if information on the 1099 is incorrect, call Devon Direct at 405-228-4800.

Social Responsibility





DEVON'S VISION

At Devon Energy, our vision is to be the premier independent oil and natural gas producer in North America.
We strive to deliver industry-leading results, starting with the health and safety of our employees and the communities where we live and work. We seek to set the standard as a good neighbor, a valued community partner, a caring environmental steward and a model employer.

Our motto is Commitment Runs Deep.
We take this to heart and apply it to everyone who has a stake in our success – investors, employees and neighbors alike. 
What’s New?We continually work to improve the way we operate, and that includes communication. As always, we want to speak clearly and directly to each and every stakeholder with an interest in what we’re doing. This 2016 Corporate Social Responsibility Report is designed to do just that; it’s comprehensive, yet also easily divided by topic. However it’s used, we hope it facilitates further discussion of issues important to all of us. 
This report covers operations and activities at Devon in 2016. It’s an update from our last report in 2015 and represents the latest chapter in a chronicle of corporate social responsibility dating back to the founding of our company by John and Larry Nichols in 1971. 
We will continue to update our reporting on this website.

Letter to Stakeholders
A PLAN TO DO EVEN BETTER

ResponsibilityIn business, difficult challenges arise every day. At Devon Energy, we see it as our responsibility to confront these challenges head-on. We work thoughtfully, in keeping with our strongly held core values. We know you’re counting on us to perform with the highest degree of integrity, whether you’re an investor, employee or one of our many neighbors. 
As a leading North American oil and natural gas producer, we have an important part to play in fueling the progress and prosperity of our nation and the world. Reliable, affordable energy – and the many products derived from oil and natural gas – elevate the standard of living for more and more people every day. It’s our role to help meet consumer demand, safely and responsibly.


ResistancePerhaps the biggest challenge we face is opposition to fossil fuels. It’s a challenge we’re prepared to answer, because the world needs energy – and responsible citizens like Devon to produce it. Safe and comfortable homes, clean water and abundant food all require energy. It’s the lifeblood of economic progress and technological advancement worldwide.
Actions speak louder than words, so please know this: our company is focused on delivering results. That’s one of our values, along with doing the right thing and being a good neighbor. Our results have positioned Devon as a highly regarded industry leader, generating returns for shareholders, support for communities, satisfying work for employees and environmental health and safety for our neighbors. 
TrustAt Devon, we establish trust among our neighbors by doing what we say we’re going to do.
And so we forge ahead with our values intact and our stakeholders in mind. We invest in our communities with generous grants to schools and nonprofits and with employees volunteering thousands of hours in neighborhoods to achieve goals we all share. We continually sharpen our environmental focus, reflective of our commitment to air quality, water management and industry-leading business practices designed to preserve and protect natural resources and wildlife. We participate in our system of rules and laws, backing candidates and issues that recognize the value we create. And all of this is possible only because our people work so hard to innovate and bring about better performance.
IntegrityAt Devon, we have, quite literally, put a stake in the ground. Stamped in the floor of our headquarters’ entryway for every visitor to see: “Integrity defines the core of every relationship we have.” This sums up our values. Everyone who works for Devon knows what’s expected. 
And, at the end of the day, we go home to our loved ones. We’re not some faceless corporation, but a strong group of caring and engaged individuals working hard to make a positive difference in the communities we’re proud to call home. Corporate social responsibility is synonymous with our integrity. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved since we began 45 years ago, and we’re busy executing on our plan to do even better.

Governance
EXPERIENCE, CHARACTER DEFINE DEVON'S LEADERSHIP



Not only does integrity define our corporate relationships, it drives our culture and guides our governance. 
Devon is led by a nine-member board of directors, including seven independent directors. Our non-independent directors are Chairman John Richels and President and CEO Dave Hager. 
The board is composed of seven men and two women. There are four committees — Audit, Compensation, Reserves and Governance — each composed of independent members. An independent director also serves as lead director, who oversees the executive sessions of our independent board members at each regularly scheduled board meeting.
Directors are compensated for their work based on prevailing market norms. Stock awards represent a majority of the total compensation for board members, providing a strong financial incentive for sound governance.
When considering a director candidate, our Governance Committee looks first at factors such as integrity and accountability, informed judgment, peer respect and high performance standards.
Shareholder engagementShareholders elect directors annually. If a director fails to receive the required votes in an uncontested election, the director must offer to resign, according to Devon’s bylaws. However, this provision has never been needed. At the 2016 shareholders meeting, for example, directors received an average approval of 97 percent. 
Shareholder proposals are considered as part of the company’s annual proxy process. In 2016, shareholders voted on four such proposals, none of which passed. Our bylaws also afford shareholders the right to call a special meeting. Additionally, in 2016, Devon implemented proxy access rights, which allow certain investors and groups of investors to nominate director candidates and include them in the company’s proxy statement.
Devon’s Corporate Governance team reaches out to investors throughout the year to ensure that Devon’s senior leaders and board understand the issues of greatest significance to shareholders. These conversations most recently have involved proxy access, executive compensation and important environmental, social and governance matters.
Executive managementCompensation for senior executives is driven primarily by goals for overall company performance and long-term investor returns. Provisions for avoiding conflicts of interest are found in the company’s code of business conduct and ethics, agreed to annually by all employees and directors.
Our senior leaders provide the board with regular updates and assessments of the various economic, environmental and social risk factors the company faces. Our executives also participate in numerous small-group meetings and field visits, plus twice yearly “town hall” meetings with all employees to discuss the company’s accomplishments and future objectives.

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        
        Issued June 2, 2004.
        Before Commissioners: Pat Wood, III, Chairman; Nora Mead Brownell, and Joseph T. Kelliher 
I. Introduction 
1. On March 1, 2004, ISO New England Inc. (ISO-NE) submitted a filing in compliance with the Commission's directive in Devon Power LLC,
et al. that a locational installed capacity (LICAP) market or deliverability requirements be implemented in New England by June 1, 2004.[1] 
           Installed Capacity (ICAP) obligations are intended to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to supply system peak load under all contingencies taking into account events such as generator outages. In this order, the Commission establishes hearing procedures regarding ISO-NE's filing, and delays the implementation of a LICAP market until the conclusion of those proceedings. The Commission will direct the presiding judge to issue an initial decision by June 1, 2005. The Commission will defer implementation of the LICAP proposal, as modified in this order, until January 1, 2006. The Commission believes that deferring implementation until then will not only allow for a comprehensive examination of the issues at hearing but will also allow for completion of needed infrastructure upgrades in New England's constrained areas. Consistent with the recent policy on Reliability Compensation Issues, the Commission's goal in establishing these hearing procedures is to arrive at a final LICAP market design that will appropriately compensate generators needed for reliability and attract and retain necessary infrastructure to assure long-term reliability. Along with deferring the implementation date, the Commission directs ISO-NE to file reports updating progress made in the siting, permitting and construction of transmission and generation upgrades within the New England control area, with particular emphasis on progress within Designated Congested Areas (DCAs). ISO-NE is directed to file these reports every 90 days, beginning 90 days after the date of this order.
2. In this order, the Commission agrees with two broad concepts in ISO-NE's proposal. First, the Commission finds it appropriate to establish ICAP regions, but is concerned that the specific regions proposed by ISO-NE do not adequately reflect where infrastructure investment is needed, especially with regard to the constrained area of Southwest Connecticut (SWCT). Based on the analytical approach to Reliability Compensation Issues established in the May 6, 2004 PJM Order [2] 
          , the Commission believes that a separate ICAP region for SWCT may be appropriate, and is considering revising ISO-NE's proposal to incorporate a separate SWCT region. Accordingly, this order directs ISO-NE to submit a further filing addressing whether the Commission should revise ISO-NE's proposal to create a separate import-constrained ICAP region for SWCT. Additionally, ISO-NE has indicated that an ICAP region cannot be a subset of an energy load zone. The Commission acknowledges this potential problem, and finds that the institution of a separate energy load zone for SWCT in advance of the implementation of LICAP may be appropriate, as it would send more appropriate price signals and more appropriately distribute reliability costs to those who benefit from them. Thus, the Commission also institutes an investigation and paper hearing in Docket No. EL04-102-000 regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for SWCT, and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of LICAP.
3. Second, the Commission agrees with the overarching concept of a demand curve, but finds that more information is necessary to appropriately set the parameters of the demand curve for each ICAP region and is establishing a hearing for that purpose. For example, ISO-NE has proposed a methodology that may understate the level of capacity that may be transferred between ICAP regions. The Commission finds that, as a result, ISO-NE has not justified its proposed method for calculating the Capacity Transfer Limits (CTLs). The hearing established by the Commission, in addition to determining the demand curve parameters, shall also determine the proper method for calculating CTLs, the appropriate method for determining the amount of Capacity Transfer Rights (CTRs) to be allocated, and the proper allocation of CTRs. 
4. Until LICAP is implemented, the Commission will extend the Peaking Unit Safe Harbor (PUSH) mechanism, and will consider reliability-must-run (RMR) contracts to ensure that market participants are appropriately compensated for reliability services in the short-term. This order benefits customers by ensuring that there is sufficient generation available in New England to meet current and long-term needs. 
II. Background and Procedural History 
A. Procedural History 
5. This proceeding began on February 26, 2003, when Devon Power LLC, Middletown Power LLC, Montville Power LLC, Norwalk Power LLC and NRG Power Marketing Inc. (collectively NRG) filed, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA),[3] 

           four cost-of-service RMR agreements covering 1,728 MW of generating capacity located within Connecticut and the SWCT DCAs. These agreements were negotiated between NRG and ISO-NE in accordance with New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Market Rule 17.3 to provide compensation for generating units (and associated reliability projects) necessary for reliability in SWCT and Connecticut. NRG contended in its filing that the recently-approved New England Standard Market Design (NE-SMD) market would not provide Start Printed Page 33002adequate compensation to the units covered by the contracts.
6. On March 12, 2003, NRG filed an emergency motion seeking expedited issuance of an order accepting the RMR agreements for filing. In that motion, it contended that without assurance of cost-recovery, needed maintenance projects on the generating units could not be completed before the summer peak season. On March 25, 2003, the Commission issued an order accepting only a portion of the RMR agreements, which allowed NRG to collect funds for needed summer maintenance through a tracking mechanism administered by ISO-NE.[4] 

7. The April 25 Order addressed the entirety of the RMR agreements. In that order, the Commission rejected the RMR agreements, and allowed collection of only going-forward maintenance costs through the tracking mechanism approved in the March 25 Order. In so doing, the Commission expressed concerns about the effect RMR contracts have on the competitive market, and stated that ISO-NE, “rather than focusing on and using stand-alone RMR agreements, should incorporate the effect of those agreements into a market-type mechanism.” [5] 
           Pursuant to section 206 of the FPA,[6] 
           the Commission directed revisions to NEPOOL Market Rule 1 to lessen the need for RMR agreements. These revisions allowed low-capacity factor generating units operating in DCAs to increase their bids to recover their fixed and variable costs, and allowed the energy bids of peaking units to determine the locational marginal price (LMP) by creating the PUSH bidding mechanism. The Commission also eliminated the CT Proxy mechanism for mitigation. Additionally, the Commission directed ISO-NE “to file no later than March 1, 2004 for implementation no later than June 1, 2004, a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the ICAP or resource adequacy market * * * so that DCAs may be appropriately compensated for reliability.” [7] 
           In its order on rehearing, the Commission affirmed PUSH bidding, and clarified its section 206 finding.[8] 
           During the time-period in which these orders were issued, the Commission also rejected similar RMR contracts filed by PPL Wallingford Energy LLC, reiterating the concerns expressed in the April 25 Order and the revisions directed by that order.[9] 

8. In early 2004, NRG returned to the Commission to again seek RMR agreements for the Devon, Montville and Middletown generating units. NRG also asked the Commission to extend the tracking mechanism for collecting going forward maintenance costs for an additional year. In an order issued March 22, 2004, the Commission accepted the RMR agreements, set the costs included in the agreements for hearing, and conditioned them to terminate on the day a LICAP market or deliverability requirement is implemented in accordance with the April 25 Order.[10] 
           The Commission reasoned that accepting the agreements for a limited term was appropriate given the poor performance under PUSH of uniquely situated and aging Devon, Montville and Middletown generating units.[11] 
           In an order issued on April 1, 2004, the Commission also accepted an extension of the tracking mechanism for maintenance costs, and conditioned the mechanism to terminate the day a LICAP market or deliverability requirement is implemented.[12] 
           Again, the Commission reasoned that continuing the tracker is a reasonable interim measure until market changes could be put into place.[13] 
           In both orders, the Commission expressed confidence that once the market changes directed in the April 25 Order were implemented, out-of-market arrangements like RMR agreements and cost trackers would no longer be necessary.[14] 


B. ISO-NE's Compliance Filing
9. In compliance with the April 25 Order, ISO-NE filed a LICAP proposal on March 1, 2004. New England currently has a non-locational ICAP mechanism in place. In meeting its ICAP requirement currently, a load-serving entity (LSE) may procure resources located anywhere within the NEPOOL control area.[15] 
           However, because of transmission constraints, not all energy produced from qualified ICAP resources can be physically deliverable to all loads in New England.[16] 
           ISO-NE's LICAP proposal would take account of transmission constraints by imposing separate ICAP requirements for each of four regions: Maine (classified as an export-constrained region), Connecticut and Northeastern Massachusetts/Boston (NEMA/Boston) (classified as import-constrained regions), and the remainder of New England (Rest of Pool). The amount of capacity that LSEs in one region could procure from another region would be limited by the CTLs established by the ISO between the two regions. ISO-NE states that the CTLs would be set at levels based on planning criteria that may be below the actual amount of real-time electric flow that the transmission interface is capable of accommodating.
10. Currently, an LSE is required to procure a specified amount of ICAP each month based on its projected peak demand. All LSEs within New England can procure the resources from any units that are eligible to sell ICAP. ISO-NE proposes through the use of a demand curve to move from this set amount of monthly ICAP to an amount that can vary monthly within certain parameters. Additionally, ISO-NE proposes to impose certain limitations, based on the location of the resources, that can be used to satisfy an LSEs obligation to procure ICAP. To implement these restrictions, ISO-NE proposes to use four zones for ICAP. The price of ICAP for each of the four regions would be determined monthly through the interplay of ICAP supply bids and an administratively-determined demand curve in a monthly ISO-administered capacity auction. In essence, the ICAP requirement in a region and the regional ICAP price would be established at the point where supply (as reflected in suppliers' bids) and demand (as reflected in the administratively-determined demand curve) clear. The demand curve is designed to allow for more predictable ICAP revenues and more gradual price movements. It also ensures that the region will compensate ICAP resources above and beyond 100 percent of the current capacity requirement (referred to as the Objective Capability) in New Start Printed Page 33003England, which is 112 percent of peak load. 
11. When a demand curve is used to determine LSEs' ICAP obligations, the amount and price of that ICAP will be determined based on the height and slope that is used for the particular demand curve. The design of the demand curve—its height and slope—requires selection of two points. The selection of these points will affect the price and quantity of ICAP that LSEs must procure. The first point sets the ICAP price at the point where average surplus capacity is equal to the cost of new entry. ISO-NE calculated the average surplus as 106.7 percent of the capacity requirement. ISO-NE states that this figure is intended to reflect the average surplus since 1989, when New England became a summer peaking system. ISO-NE believes it is reasonable to assume that, on average, there will be surplus capacity in the electricity market over time. ISO-NE uses $6.66 per kilowatt month, the current ICAP deficiency charge in the current capacity market, as the cost of new entry. The ISO proposes to adjust the demand curve downward to account for infra-marginal revenue from the energy market and ancillary service market. This moves (lowers) the first point lower, from $6.66 per kilowatt month to $4.56 per kilowatt month. ISO-NE derived this amount based on the annual average infra-marginal revenue for a gas turbine over the period of May 1999 through December 2003 which is estimated as $2.10 per kilowatt month. 
12. The second point is the point where the price of capacity is equal to zero, which is where the demand curve itself crosses the x axis. ISO-NE set this point at 118 percent of the capacity requirement. ISO-NE selected this value for several reasons. First, it contends that planning studies showed that additional capacity has little impact on system reliability after achieving 18 percent surplus. Second, ISO-NE believes that the demand curve should include all surplus capacity conditions that are likely to occur and that there is little likelihood that the surplus capacity will exceed that level. Finally, ISO-NE asserts that the 118 percent value also makes New England's demand curve consistent with the NYISO's statewide ICAP demand curve.[17] 
           The demand curve is thus constructed by drawing the linear function that intersects the two points. ISO-NE states that the linear demand curve provides a good first approximation of several different functional forms and has as well a moderate slope that may deter the exercise of market power by making it more difficult to withhold output in order to increase price.
13. Finally, the proposed curve becomes horizontal to the left of 95 percent of the capacity requirement. Thus, the ICAP price would be the same for all capacity levels between 0 percent and 95 percent of the capacity requirement. ISO-NE believes that this last feature is unlikely to affect prices.

14. ISO-NE proposes to phase-in the demand curve over five years for import-constrained regions, in part to avoid significant price shocks there.[18] 

           During the phase-in period, prices derived by application of the demand Start Printed Page 33004curve in these constrained sub-regions would be capped at $1.00 per kilowatt month in the first year, and would increase by $1.00 per year to $5.00 in the fifth year. After the fifth year, prices in the four regions would be determined without the use of price caps. The five-year period coincides with the projected completion of key transmission projects in Connecticut and NEMA/Boston which, the ISO believes, provides sufficient time for the development of additional capacity.
15. During the five year transition period, generating units in NEMA/Boston and Connecticut that had capacity factors of 15 percent or less in 2003 and that are needed for reliability would be paid “transition payments” of $5.34 per kilowatt month.[19] 
           A resource would actually receive the transition payment minus the spot auction clearing price for the constrained region. Thus, the transition payment would function as a cap on the revenues above variable costs that a unit would be able to earn. ISO-NE argues that the use of transition payments would allow for the elimination of the PUSH mechanism entirely, and would allow for the phase-out of RMR contracts. A unit that qualifies for the transition payment that is not operating under an RMR contract would receive the transition payment until the end of the phase-in period or until ISO-NE determines the unit is no longer needed for reliability. The costs of the transition payments would be allocated to network load within each ICAP region, the same manner in which the costs of RMR contracts are allocated currently. As a result, ISO-NE states that “one of the unfortunate features of the transition payments is that they cannot be hedged because they are an additional above-market payment needed to maintain reliability.” [20] 
           Thus, a customer in an import-constrained region (NEMA/Boston and Connecticut) would still incur the costs of transition payments even if that customer has contracted bilaterally for ICAP.
16. Under ISO-NE's proposal, a generator selling ICAP would be paid the market clearing price in the region in which the resource is located; a participant serving load would buy ICAP at the market clearing price in the region where the load is located. When the transfer capability between regions limits the ability to import capacity into one region in the ICAP market, the ICAP prices in the two regions would differ. The difference in regional prices represents a type of ICAP congestion charge, similar to the congestion charge that arises when transmission capacity is congested in the spot energy market. ISO-NE proposes to create Capacity Transfer Rights to allow market participants to hedge these ICAP congestion costs. Capacity Transfer Rights in the ICAP market are similar to financial transmission rights (FTRs) in the spot energy market. The holder of a Capacity Transfer Right between two regions would receive congestion revenue—i.e., the difference in ICAP prices—between the two regions, just as the holder of an FTR receives congestion revenue from the spot energy market. ISO-NE proposes to allocate these ICAP congestion revenues to entities holding Capacity Transfer Rights in the export and import constrained regions. Capacity Transfer Rights would be allocated to loads in import-constrained regions (i.e., NEMA/Boston and Connecticut) and to generators in export-constrained regions (i.e., Maine). In addition, Capacity Transfer Rights allocations would be made to original holders of entitlements to municipal utility resources constructed as pool planned units with life-of-the-unit contracts. Pursuant to section 8.9.6 of Market Rule 1, this “special allocation” of Capacity Transfer Rights would be made to certain municipal utility resources constructed as pool planned units in import-constrained regions. Finally, any transmission upgrades not funded through pool transmission rates that result in additional transfer capability that is associated with additional Capacity Transfer Rights would be allocated to the entities that pay for the upgrades.
17. As part of the LICAP proposal, ISO-NE revised Market Rule 1 to include corresponding mitigation provisions. Based on the limited competition situation in the import-constrained ICAP regions, the mitigation measures would apply to all resources in such regions that are authorized to sell capacity. ISO-NE proposes to evaluate and deny requests by participants in import-constrained ICAP regions to cease selling ICAP within New England (delisting). 
Chiefly, the resource requesting to cease or reduce its ICAP sales would need to demonstrate that this was an economic decision for that unit. To do so the resource must demonstrate that the expected revenue or the expected cost savings associated with the external sale or lack of a sale will exceed the expected ICAP revenues, applicable transition payments, and other market revenues that the resource would otherwise receive.
18. ISO-NE also proposes conduct and market impact thresholds for the LICAP market in import-constrained ICAP regions.[21] 
           ISO-NE's proposal would employ a conduct and impact test and a reference level-based mitigation scheme. The ICAP reference level could be established in one of three ways: (1) The ISO would be authorized to determine the reference level based on a resource's estimated going-forward costs net of expected market revenues; (2) a resource may submit a proposed reference level with supporting documentation for review by the ISO; or (3) where no reference level is submitted or there is inadequate information to set a level, a default ICAP reference level of $1.00 per kilowatt month, which is intended to roughly account for a resource's costs of providing ICAP rather than being delisted. ISO-NE would utilize a conduct threshold of $1.00 per kilowatt month in import-constrained regions to identify economic withholding and a market impact threshold of $1.00 per kilowatt month.[22] 
           Prior to mitigating a resource's offer, the ISO would attempt to contact the resource owner to provide an opportunity to explain the observed behavior. In the event mitigation is necessary, a default offer is established as the greater of $1.00 per kilowatt month, the ICAP reference level, or the estimated ICAP clearing price in the Rest of Pool region. Modifications have also been made to the energy market mitigation thresholds applicable to units receiving transition payments. In import-constrained regions, such units would be subject to a reduced energy offer price threshold of $12.50/MWh, and tighter start-up and no-load thresholds of 25 percent. These units will also face a tighter operating reserve credit threshold of 50 percent.
19. Finally, ISO-NE states that the submitted proposal is “not intended to be the final word on resource adequacy in New England.” In conjunction with the LICAP process, the ISO initiated a Regional Dialogue, which includes a more general initiative to address Start Printed Page 33005regional resource adequacy and to work toward a long-term solution. This forum includes market participants and state regulators. The ISO recognizes that the current LICAP Proposal may be modified or replaced by a different long-term regional resource adequacy mechanism. Thus, ISO-NE commits to continuing the Regional Dialogue for at least 18 months from the date of implementation to continue to work toward a long-term regional resource adequacy mechanism. ISO-NE will evaluate the performance of LICAP after one year of operation, and eighteen months after implementation will be prepared to file a plan regarding long-term regional resource adequacy in New England that could affirm, modify, augment, or replace the instant proposal.
20. ISO-NE requests that the Commission provide guidance on the issue of what entity should bear the responsibility for longer-term capacity procurement and long-term reliability. ISO-NE states that the Regional Dialogue has not yet produced a consensus as to which entity should be responsible for ensuring long-term resource adequacy. ISO-NE's view is that the state regulatory officials, and the distribution companies within each state regulated by those officials, are best positioned to fulfill this role. ISO-NE believes that Commission guidance on this issue would significantly narrow the issues that must be addressed by New England's stakeholders in the Regional Dialogue.
III. Notice of Filing, Protests, Comments and Interventions
21. Notice of Applicants' filing was published in the Federal Register,[23] 
           with comments, protests or interventions due on or before March 22, 2004. The entities filing timely motions to intervene, or who are parties to this proceeding by virtue of their earlier intervention in this docket and submission of a protest or comments regarding the instant filing, are listed in Appendix A to this order. Several parties filed protests, comments, or motions to reject the filing. These parties are listed in Appendix B to this order.
22. On April 2, 2004, ISO-NE filed a motion for leave to answer. On April 6, 2004, National Grid USA (National Grid) filed a response to certain comments and protests made by other parties, and The Indicated Suppliers (Indicated Suppliers) [24] 
           filed a motion for leave to answer and answer to certain of the comments and protests previously submitted. On April 12, 2004, Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc. (ConEd) filed an answer to ISO-NE's answer. On April 16, 2004, FPL Energy, LLC (FPL) filed a motion for leave to answer and answer to ISO-NE's answer. On April 19, 2004, Calpine Eastern filed an answer to National Grid's response, and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade LLC filed a motion for leave to answer and answer to Indicated Suppliers answer. On April 26, 2004, the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) filed a motion for leave to respond and response to ISO-NE's answer.
23. Additionally, on April 26, 2004, the New England Suppliers Coalition (Suppliers Coalition) [25] 
           filed a motion to lodge in the record a press release issued by ISO-NE on April 16, 2004 regarding the results of its Gap Request for Proposals (Gap RFP) to procure reliability products and services in SWCT for a four-year period beginning in June 2004. On April 29, 2004, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (CT DPUC) and the Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel (CT OCC) filed a joint answer in opposition to the motion to lodge. On May 11, 2004, Fitchburg Gas and Electric Light Company and Unitil Energy Systems, Inc. filed a response to the motion to lodge.
24. On May 20, 2004, several entities, including National Grid, NSTAR Electric and Gas Corporation, and various state governmental entities, jointly filed supplemental comments and a motion to lodge.[26] 
           The motion seeks to lodge in the record in this proceeding an Ancillary Services Market Enhancements White Paper prepared by ISO-NE.
IV. Discussion
A. Procedural Matters
25. Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,[27] 
18 CFR 385.214 (2003), the notices of intervention and timely, unopposed motions to intervene serve to make the entities that filed them parties to this proceeding. In addition, several of the entities listed as parties in Appendix A are proper parties to this proceeding by virtue of their previous interventions in the instant docket.[28] 
           Motions to intervene out-of-time were filed by several entities.[29] 
           Pursuant to Rule 214(d) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,[30] 
           given the interest of these entities in this proceeding and the absence of any undue prejudice or delay, the Commission finds good cause to grant their untimely, unopposed motions to intervene out-of-time. Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure [31] 

           prohibits an answer to a protest and answer unless otherwise ordered by the decisional authority. We will accept the answers filed in the instant proceeding because they provided information that helped us in our decision-making process. Additionally, in the interest of developing a full record for consideration during the subsequent procedures directed in this order, the Commission will grant the motions to lodge filed by the Suppliers Coalition and National Grid, et al.

1. Applicable Statutory Standard of Review
26. As noted above, ISO-NE submitted the instant filing as a compliance filing pursuant to Rule 1907 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,[32] 
           in response to the Commission's directive in the April 25 Order to “establish a mechanism implementing location or deliverability requirements in the Installed Capacity * * * or resource adequacy market, in a manner that reduces reliance on Reliability Must Run * * * agreements.” [33] 

           Several entities have raised issues in their comments and protests regarding the propriety of submitting the instant filing as a compliance filing, and whether section Start Printed Page 33006205 [34] 
           or section 206 [35] 
           of the FPA should apply.
27. Several parties question whether ISO-NE properly filed the instant proposal as a “compliance filing.” The CT DPUC and CT OCC, for example, moved to reject the instant filing as an improper compliance filing, arguing that the comprehensive nature of the market changes proposed in the filing, and the rate increase ISO-NE acknowledges may result, should not be approved by the Commission through a compliance filing because to do so would “depriv[e] potential objectors of the protections normally accorded for tariff increases.” [36] 
           They also contend that ISO-NE's filing is an improper compliance filing under 18 CFR 154.203(b) (2003) [37] 
           because it proposes to increase rates, which they argue the April 25 Order did not authorize. United Illuminating (UI) similarly states that the transitional payments included in the instant proposal amount to a new rate, which it argues cannot be proposed and approved through a compliance filing.
28. Additionally, many of the parties to this proceeding generally raise the issue of whether ISO-NE should have submitted the instant filing under section 205 or section 206 of the FPA. Of the entities raising this issue, most contend that section 206 should apply. CT DPUC and CT OCC, for example, contend that the only possible basis for the instant filing is section 206, noting that ISO-NE does not have exclusive rights to make a section 205 filing and that the Commission's original direction to make a compliance filing was issued pursuant to section 206. Several other parties, including the Attorneys General of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources and Rhode Island Commission, and the New Hampshire Office of Consumer Advocate similarly contend that the standards of section 206 should apply to the instant proceeding.[38] 

29. Commission Response. The Commission will apply the standards of section 206 of the FPA to the instant proceeding. In the April 25 Order the Commission directed revisions to NEPOOL Market Rule 1 “pursuant to section 206 of the Federal Power Act.” [39] 
           Specifically, the Commission directed ISO-NE to file “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the ICAP or resource adequacy market * * * so that capacity within DCAs may be appropriately compensated for reliability.” [40] 
           In the July 24 Order on rehearing, the Commission clarified that it was taking action under section 206 of the FPA, formally stating that it “found that Market Rule 1 * * * created an unjust and unreasonable result, requiring a revision in the rule to solve these problems.” [41] 
           In light of these findings, the Commission finds it appropriate to continue to apply the standards of section 206 in its consideration of the instant compliance filing.
30. Applying the standard of section 206 of the FPA, the issues here are whether the current market rules for ICAP in New England are “unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential,” and whether new market rules approved or ordered by the Commission are just and reasonable.[42] 
           As noted above, the Commission has already satisfied the first requirement in this proceeding, finding in the April 25 Order and July 24 Order that Market Rule 1 as it then existed “created an unjust and unreasonable result.” As discussed in more detail below, ISO-NE's proposal must be modified to achieve a just and reasonable long-term solution. Therefore, in the interim the Commission will retain the PUSH mechanism and allow for the filing of RMR contracts where justified until the LICAP market is implemented. The Commission finds that this provides a just and reasonable method of solving the Reliability Compensation Issues present in New England.
31. Additionally, we are not persuaded by the contention that the instant filing is an improper compliance filing. First, given the use of the section 206 procedures in this case, the Commission has not deprived any party of an opportunity to comment or protest, contrary to the assertions of CT DPUC and CT OCC. Notice of the ISO-NE's filing was published in the Federal Register, and a large number of parties submitted written comments or protests at the invitation of that notice. The Commission has carefully considered all of the comments and protests, and as a result has provided substantial due process to all the parties before it, in accordance with section 206 of the FPA. Furthermore, we do not accept the assertions of CT DPUC and CT OCC, among others, that the instant filing is an improper compliance filing because of its comprehensive nature and possibility for increased rates. The Commission rule cited by CT DPUC requiring that compliance filings “include only those changes required to comply with the order,” and prohibiting such filings from including “other rate or tariff change filings,” is inapplicable to the present proceeding.[43] 
           Additionally, we note that here, ISO-NE was directed to file “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the ICAP or resource adequacy market.” [44] 
           The tariff and rate changes included in the filing, while extensive, are directly related to the directive, and are not separate rate or tariff changes. Therefore, rejection of the filing is not warranted.
B. Analysis of ISO-NE's Proposal and Commission Response
32. The Commission agrees with two broad concepts: ICAP regions and the use of a demand curve. The Commission rejects the transition mechanism, directs ISO-NE to submit a further filing addressing whether the Commission should revise its proposal to create an additional ICAP region for SWCT, establishes an investigation and paper hearing regarding the establishment of a separate SWCT energy load zone in advance of LICAP, and establishes a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge regarding the parameters of the demand curve and related issues. As a result of these changes we will delay full implementation of the LICAP market until the conclusion of these proceedings. We anticipate that this will permit implementation of LICAP in New England by January 1, 2006. We Start Printed Page 33007discuss our reasoning for this decision in the analysis that follows.
33. In the PJM Order, the Commission outlined an analytical approach it intends to follow in addressing Reliability Compensation Issues such as those at issue in this proceeding. This process begins with posing the question: does this organized market exhibit material short-term or long-term Reliability Compensation Issues? [45] 
           Short-term Reliability Compensation Issues relate principally to the appropriate compensation for units that are needed for reliability and are subject to mitigation with the result that the units are receiving non-compensatory revenue impacting their ability to provide service. Long-term Reliability Compensation Issues relate principally to local capacity shortages identified in the organized market's reliability-based planning process resulting from the reasonably expected retirement of units or the need for new infrastructure that is not anticipated to be installed.
34. If the inquiry shows that the organized market exhibits material Reliability Compensation Issues, the next step is to evaluate whether market design improvements can be implemented that will work to resolve the issues. Conversely, if the inquiry does not find that the organized market exhibits material Reliability Compensation Issues and the issue is of sufficiently narrow scope, then significant focus on general design issues is not required and targeted approaches (such as unit specific contracts or compensation schemes) may be appropriate. Such demonstration must include a showing that the revenue produced by the proposed solution is adequate to actually solve the problem at hand and that the proposed solution includes safeguards to prevent the unwarranted exercise of market power beyond the recovery of such necessary revenue.
35. In the case of ISO-NE, the Commission determines that it exhibits both short and long-term Reliability Compensation Issues. These issues have been clearly demonstrated in the filings for RMR contracts in NEMA/Boston and SWCT. These contracts were filed by ISO-NE because these units were not able to earn sufficient revenues through the markets to justify their continued operation. In NEMA/Boston these reliability concerns have been limited to the need for RMR contracts for a limited number of specific units that are needed to satisfy reliability because of the location of these units. The RMR contracts were filed because specific units were needed, not because there were inadequate resources within NEMA/Boston in general. As such, reliability compensation appears to be more of a short-term issue in NEMA/Boston.[46] 

36. In contrast, the reliability problems in SWCT have involved the need to retain all or nearly all units within this region to maintain reliable service.[47] 
           Many of these units are old and inefficient and are unable to receive sufficient funds through the operation of the markets to justify their continued operation. Thus, the concerns regarding SWCT are long-term in nature.
37. Under the policy developed in the PJM Order, the next step is to examine whether market design improvements can be implemented within New England to resolve these issues.[48] 
           As discussed further below, we believe that while the record is unclear on whether market design changes could resolve the issues within NEMA/Boston, market design changes could be implemented to resolve the Reliability Compensation Issues within SWCT.[49] 
           One market design change that was suggested in the PJM Order was the use of locational markets for installed capacity or operating reserves for the constrained area. The Commission believes that designing and implementing a well-functioning and equitable LICAP market represents a significant step in resolving Reliability Compensation Issues. In fact, we have identified locational installed capacity as a market design feature that can serve as a solution.[50] 
           The New England market as a whole appears to have adequate capacity. At the same time, nearly all existing units within SWCT are needed for reliability. Additionally, ISO-NE has also recently conducted a Request for Proposals to obtain additional resources in SWCT. Thus, the use of a local capacity market would better reflect the value of capacity in SWCT than the existing system-wide capacity market. Thus, the use of a locational capacity market could be a solution to the Reliability Compensation Issues in SWCT.
38. ISO-NE has filed a proposal that contains a locational capacity market. The Commission believes that ISO-NE's LICAP proposal has elements that would help resolve the Reliability Compensation Issues in New England. In particular, the concept of a demand curve for installed capacity has merit. Additionally, the use of separate prices for capacity in different areas in New England also moves toward a LICAP market. However, as discussed further below, we find that there are factual questions regarding certain elements of this proposal that need to be further explored at hearing.
39. The Commission finds that there are other elements of ISO-NE's proposal that do not satisfy the criteria outlined in the PJM Order. Specifically, the Commission is concerned that certain elements of ISO-NE's proposal rely on non-market solutions to attempt to resolve these Reliability Compensation Issues and that the regions chosen for the LICAP may not match the specific areas where capacity is constrained within New England. Thus, the regions may not sufficiently value capacity within the constrained areas.
40. First, under the Commission's policy, the market design changes should provide sufficient revenues to satisfy the Reliability Compensation Issues. The Commission cannot reasonably determine that ISO-NE's proposed transition payments together with its proposed five-year phase-in of LICAP will yield sufficient revenues for all generating resources during the phase-in period. Under the proposal, ISO-NE would cap the price that would be available to generators in the constrained areas during the phase-in period. In the first year, the price caps would be $1.00 per kilowatt month. This would not be a sufficient amount to resolve the Reliability Compensation Issues within the constrained areas.
41. However, since the price caps would result in lower prices than those generated by the demand curve, ISO-NE also proposes to pay a transition payment to low load-factor units within the constrained areas. The transition payments are set at $5.34 per kilowatt month for the first five years of the market.[51] 

           The $5.34 figure is based on the average cost of PUSH units in Connecticut and NEMA/Boston. There was significant debate among intervening parties over whether or not this aspect of the proposal provides sufficient revenues. Since the payment is based on an average of the PUSH limits, it may not work to provide Start Printed Page 33008sufficient revenues for all generating units. In particular, the units within SWCT had a much higher cost than those located within NEMA/Boston. Since ISO-NE would still allow RMR contracts for individual units, its proposal may only appeal to those units whose costs were at or below the average PUSH limits. For other more expensive units, it would appear that they would still have the option of obtaining RMR contracts.
42. More importantly, the transition payments create an unhedgeable cost to LSEs in import-constrained regions. In other words, the transition payments would be a non-market cost to LSEs within the import constrained areas. The Commission stated in the PJM Order that ideally, the market should encourage LSEs to engage in long-term bilateral contracting and locational requirements for ICAP could promote such contracting.[52] 
           However, ISO-NE's transition payment proposal will not adequately promote bilateral contracting and in fact may discourage it. ISO-NE's proposal requires those parties who have contracted bilaterally for ICAP to pay the same transition payments as those LSEs that have not contracted bilaterally for ICAP. Thus, the transition payments do not provide adequate incentives for LSEs to contract for supplies locationally to reduce their total costs. The allocation method will also penalize LSEs that have already entered into bilateral arrangements. The Commission does not believe that a non-market solution such as the transition payments is consistent with the policy developed for Reliability Compensation Issues in the PJM Order. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that ISO-NE's proposal provides a market solution that is consistent with the criteria discussed in the PJM order.
43. The Commission is also concerned that the proposed configuration of import-constrained regions may not be appropriate. ISO-NE proposes a single ICAP region for the entire State of Connecticut. This is consistent with its current market design. However, there is a clear and extensive record that demonstrates a distinction, in terms of reliability, between SWCT and the other parts of Connecticut. This record includes reports and filings that detail the difficulties SWCT faces with regard to reliability. For example, ISO-NE concluded that “the existing southwestern Connecticut electric power system does not meet North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), Northeast Power Coordinating Council (NPCC) and NEPOOL reliability performance standards.” [53] 
           Furthermore, when ISO-NE developed DCAs with special measures for mitigating market power, it classified SWCT as a DCA distinct from the remainder of Connecticut. ISO-NE provides no justification for failing to acknowledge this distinction in its LICAP proposal. The Commission is concerned that ISO-NE's proposal may not adequately recognize the value of resources within SWCT. It also may result in customers in other parts of Connecticut subsidizing customers within SWCT. Therefore, the Commission is not convinced that a single import-constrained area in Connecticut would produce incentives to locate infrastructure in SWCT, the location where it is most needed. Additionally, it may not provide adequate compensation for resources to remain in SWCT, thus failing to satisfy Reliability Compensation requirements of the Commission's policy.
44. Thus, the Commission finds that while a market design solution would provide a reasonable solution to the Reliability Compensation Issues in SWCT, ISO-NE's proposal must be revised to meet that objective.
45. Consequently, the Commission will adopt a market design solution for New England but will defer implementation of the LICAP proposal until the conclusion of the hearing proceedings established in this order. The delay in implementation will allow time for a hearing to resolve the contested issues regarding the LICAP mechanism. In addition, it will also provide a firm timeline for implementation and thus an incentive to participants in the constrained areas to develop resources or transmission alternatives to help mitigate the rate impact of a LICAP mechanism. In the interim, to compensate resources within the constrained areas, the Commission will continue the operation of the PUSH mechanism to reduce the impact of the mitigation measures on units that run infrequently. Additionally, the Commission will continue the use of RMR contracts for units that are needed for reliability but cannot earn sufficient revenues from the markets to continue operation.
46. Finally, the Commission believes that there may be merit in the early implementation of a separate energy load zone for SWCT.[54] 
           The use of the entire State of Connecticut may diminish the price signals in the constrained portion of the state. Since the cost of RMR contracts will also be paid by all load within the zone, the use of a larger zone may result in some customers in Connecticut subsidizing others. Therefore, as discussed further below, the Commission will institute an investigation and paper hearing in Docket No. EL04-102-000 regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for SWCT, and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of LICAP. ISO-NE is directed to address whether a separate energy load zone should be established for SWCT and implemented before LICAP.
47. The Commission addresses specific comments, protests, and issues related to the proposed LICAP mechanism in the paragraphs which follow.
1. ICAP Regions
48. As noted above, ISO-NE's proposal includes four regions for purposes of setting ICAP prices: Maine, Connecticut, NEMA/Boston, and the remainder of New England. Connecticut is defined as an import constrained ICAP region equal to the Connecticut load zone. However, some parties argue that SWCT should be its own import-constrained ICAP region. LIPA argues that ISO-NE has not justified why Connecticut and SWCT were combined as one import-constrained region. Moreover, LIPA argues that studies used during consideration of this proposal clearly justify creating a separate region for SWCT. LIPA asserts that maintaining Connecticut as a single constrained region distorts the market signals that LICAP is intended to send. LIPA argues that additional ICAP resources need to be located within SWCT to truly satisfy reliability concerns. PPL Parties argue that, in establishing an import-constrained region for Connecticut as a whole, ISO-NE's proposal would equate the locational value of a unit in severely constrained SWCT with the locational value of a unit in the relatively unconstrained areas in the rest of Connecticut, thus undervaluing units in the most needed locations and providing no incentive to direct new generation entry to the most critical sites.
49. Commission Response. The two geographic areas in New England that have reliability problems are NEMA/Boston and SWCT, which currently are identified as DCAs. While ISO-NE's Start Printed Page 33009proposal separates NEMA/Boston into its own region, there is significant evidence that SWCT is the most heavily constrained area within New England. Recently, the state of Connecticut has stressed the need to focus on potential reliability problems in SWCT. In a July 3, 2002 report, the CT DPUC stated that “inadequate local generation and transmission congestion in SWCT make the region vulnerable to reliability problems in the event that demand is higher than expected or generation units or transmission lines serving the area are unavailable.” [55] 
           In December 2003, the Connecticut Siting Council (CSC) submitted a ten-year forecast of loads and resources within the State which reported that “some sub-regions such as SWCT are threatened with supply deficiencies and voltage instability problems due to insufficient transmission and inadequate resources within the region.” [56] 
           That report also notes that “[i]t is increasingly important for resources to be strategically located on the grid to ensure electric supply can technically and economically serve pockets of high demand.” [57] 
           Additionally, in its comments in this proceeding, NRG points to the Gap RFP, through which ISO-NE procured reliability services which it could call on during possible emergency situations. In this submittal ISO-NE stated that “as in years past, the ISO expects that the combination of electric load and operating reserve requirements in SWCT will exceed the resources available for the sub-region in the summer of 2004.” [58] 
           NRG also notes a recent ISO-NE-commissioned study which concluded that while New England has sufficient capacity available to it in aggregate, the capacity is not optimally located in the areas where it is needed for reliability. Specifically, SWCT is identified in that study as an area where the amounts of capacity are verging on deficient. The study concluded that capacity shortages in constrained areas of New England are most severe in SWCT, and are much more severe than NEMA/Boston. 
50. Based on the assessments conducted by the state of Connecticut and ISO-NE, as well as the comments and protests considered by the Commission in the instant proceeding, the Commission is concerned that the ICAP regions proposed by ISO-NE do not adequately reflect where infrastructure additions are needed most. The infrastructure problem in SWCT has been accurately defined, but the proposal submitted by ISO-NE does not appear to the Commission to create the incentives needed to remedy this problem. Grouping SWCT with the rest of the State unfairly burdens Connecticut customers that are not affected by limitations in transmission capacity in SWCT. With this proposal, for example, capacity would be priced the same outside of SWCT as it is in SWCT. This price signal sends the inaccurate message to potential investors that capacity is needed just as much in outside of SWCT as it is needed in SWCT. Additionally, the Commission fails to understand why NEMA/Boston, as a DCA in New England, is classified as a separate LICAP region while SWCT is not. 
51. Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that a separate SWCT ICAP region may be appropriate, to ensure that the LICAP market in New England achieves the goals we outlined in the PJM Order. As a result, ISO-NE is directed to submit a further filing in Docket No. ER03-563-030 addressing whether the Commission should revise its proposal to create a separate import-constrained ICAP region for SWCT. The Commission will require ISO-NE to submit this filing within 30 days from the date of this order, and will permit responses to ISO-NE's submittal to be filed within 21 days from the date ISO-NE makes its filing. Furthermore, the Commission notes that ISO-NE states in its answer that creating a separate ICAP region for SWCT would also involve creating a separate load zone in SWCT for pricing energy. As noted above, the Commission believes that creating this separate load zone could have significant benefits, even in advance of the implementation of LICAP. As a result, pursuant to section 206 of the FPA, the Commission will institute an investigation and paper hearing in Docket No. EL04-102-000 regarding whether a separate energy load zone should be created for SWCT, and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of LICAP. The Commission will require ISO-NE to address the issue of whether a separate energy load zone should be created for SWCT, and whether it should be implemented in advance of the implementation of LICAP, in a filing to be made within 30 days from the date of this order in Docket No. EL04-102-000. The Commission will issue notice of ISO-NE's filing, and permit interested parties to intervene and file responses within 21 days of the date ISO-NE makes its filing. 
52. In cases where, as here, the Commission institutes a section 206 proceeding on its own motion, section 206(b) requires that the Commission establish a refund effective date that is no earlier than 60 days after publication of notice of the Commission's investigation in the Federal Register, and no later than five months subsequent to expiration of the 60-day period. We will establish the statutorily-directed refund effective date, in this context for the determination of regions in Connecticut, 60 days after publication in the Federal Register of this order initiating the Commission's investigation in Docket No. EL04-102-000. In addition, section 206 requires that, if no final decision has been rendered by that date, the Commission must provide its estimate as to when it reasonably expects to make such a decision. Given the times for filing identified in this order, and the nature and complexity of the matters to be resolved, the Commission estimates that it will be able to reach a final decision by October 31, 2005. 
2. Demand Curve and Capacity Transfer 
53. As described above, ISO-NE's proposed demand curve is structured on the basis of two points. While there are numerous protests addressing the parameters of the demand curve, there appears to be very little objection to the concept of a demand curve. In fact, many parties advocate a downwardly sloping demand curve. The protests focus on the precise points that ISO-NE proposed to determine the height and slope of the demand curve. In general, representatives of LSEs and State government entities recommend changing the parameters in a way that would lower ICAP prices.[59] 
           By contrast, representatives of suppliers either support the ISO-NE's parameters or recommend parameters that would raise ICAP prices.[60] 

           For example, ConEd favors raising the point at which the Start Printed Page 33010ICAP price becomes zero to 127 percent of Objective Capability.[61] 

54. Some parties, including Indicated Suppliers and ConEd, urge the Commission to implement a Compromise Proposal that was approved in the New England stakeholder process by the Markets Committee and received a majority (58 percent) vote from the Participants Committee.[62] 
           The major difference between the Compromise Proposal and the proposal ultimately filed by ISO-NE is that the former included price floors for the Maine and Rest of Pool regions as well as higher price caps and transition payments for generators in constrained areas, both of which would result in higher ICAP payments in the relevant areas. The Compromise Proposal is supported by HQ Energy Services, ConEd, and the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA). 
55. A group consisting of state governmental entities and transmission owners in NEMA/Boston (Mass. AG et. al.) filed another alternative proposal, also using a demand curve. Under this option, the locational feature of the ISO's proposal would be removed, and ICAP resources would be bought and sold through a single, region-wide market instead of separate locational markets.[63] 

56. National Grid asserts that LICAP will not alleviate the fundamental constraints that cause the formation of load pockets and argues that the best way to ensure transmission adequacy would be to mandate a deliverability requirement across the transmission grid. In its answer, ISO-NE did not take a position on the merits of a deliverability requirement, noting that there is nothing about the LICAP proposal that would preclude the adoption of a deliverability requirement if the stakeholders and the Commission conclude that it would be beneficial. 
57. Commission Response. We agree with ISO-NE's overarching proposal to use a demand curve, and in particular a downward sloping demand curve, as part of the eventual LICAP mechanism in New England. The Commission finds that implementing a demand curve for ICAP will allow ISO-NE's market design to more closely resemble that of the neighboring ISO (NYISO) and to contribute to the elimination of seams between the two. NYISO currently uses a demand curve to set ICAP prices within its territory. NYISO also has locational requirement for procuring ICAP for LSEs located within New York City and Long Island. The adoption of LICAP by ISO-NE would make its market design more consistent with that in effect in NYISO. 
58. While we agree with ISO-NE's concept of a sloped demand curve, we find that ISO-NE has not justified the specific parameters it proposes to determine the slope and height of the demand curve. Commenters raise important questions about these parameters that cannot be resolved based on the record in this proceeding. These questions include: If the height of the curve is to be determined, at least in part, by the cost of new entry, what is the cost of new entry, and does that cost vary among the regions? What is a reasonable estimate of the net inframarginal revenues that could be expected from the energy markets, and does that revenue vary among regions? Should the ICAP price reflect the cost of new entry (net of inframarginal energy revenues) when capacity equals (i) Objective Capability, (ii) the historical average level of capacity relative to Objective Capability, or (iii) some other level? At what capacity level should the ICAP price fall to $0? Should the height and slope of the curve be based on the cost of new entry or on other factors, such as an estimate of the reliability value to loads of alternative levels of capacity, and if the latter, what are reasonable estimates of such reliability values? To what extent do the parameters of the demand curve used by the NYISO affect the ability of New England to attract ICAP capacity, and thus, how should the New York parameters affect the parameters for New England?[64] 
           The Commission finds that the use of price floors, as proposed in the Compromise Proposal, are non-market mechanisms that may not send accurate price signals and may artificially inflate ICAP prices in regions with more-than-adequate capacity levels. 
59. Based upon the foregoing, and the Commission's own preliminary analysis, we find that the parameters underlying the proposed demand curve have not been shown to be just and reasonable, and may be unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or preferential, or otherwise unlawful. Accordingly, while we agree with the concept of a demand curve for the ICAP market, we will set the parameters which will determine the slope and height of that curve for hearing procedures for the purpose of determining the just and reasonable ICAP demand curve for each ICAP region. These hearing procedures will be limited to one year to ensure that the specific parameters of the curve are in place in advance of the January 1, 2006 implementation date of the LICAP market, so that market participants can adequately prepare. The Commission will direct the presiding judge to ensure that an initial decision or settlement is issued by June 1, 2005. The presiding ALJ should structure the hearing schedule accordingly. 
60. Certain parties have argued that the Commission should adopt a deliverability requirement for ICAP supplies in New England rather than adopt a LICAP.[65] 
           The Commission directed ISO-NE to develop “a mechanism that implements location or deliverability requirements in the ICAP or resource adequacy market” in the April 25 Order.[66] 
           ISO-NE elected to pursue a locational ICAP mechanism in the near-term for, among other things, reasons of costs.[67] 

           A reliable and extensive transmission system without substantial load pockets is important for a deliverability requirement. The current transmission system in New Start Printed Page 33011England does not allow for deliverability across the entire region, and the Commission has been given no indication as to when the New England system would be physically capable of supporting a deliverability requirement. The Commission believes that the development of a transmission system that effectively eliminated import- and export-constrained regions in New England is an admirable objective. However, we recognize that the development of such infrastructure will take time and concerted effort. ISO-NE has indicated that acceptance and implementation of the LICAP proposal would not preclude the introduction of a deliverability requirement at some point in the future. The Commission would welcome a proposal to implement a deliverability requirement in New England, if and when ISO-NE and New England stakeholders collectively choose to pursue that. Until such time, the Commission believes that the LICAP proposal, with the modifications discussed in this order represents an appropriate response to the Reliability Compensation Issues we currently observe in New England. 
i. Level of Capacity Available for Transfer Between Regions 
61. As noted earlier, ISO-NE proposes to establish CTLs between ICAP regions at levels below the actual amount of real-time electric flow that the transmission interfaces are capable of accommodating. NECPUC, Mass. AG et al. and others object to ISO-NE's proposal to underestimate the amount of capacity that can be delivered into the import-constrained regions. 
62. In its answer, ISO-NE argues that increasing its proposed CTLs would be detrimental to the market. ISO-NE asserts that setting transfer limits while recognizing excess capacity may depress prices and undervalue the resources within the import-constrained region, which decreases the likelihood of either new generation entry or transmission expansion in the constrained region. 
63. Commission Response. The commenters' criticisms of ISO-NE's proposed method for determining CTLs raise issues that the Commission will set for hearing to determine the costs and benefits of understating the amount of transmission transfer capability that is actually available to procure ICAP resources across regions. The presiding judge is directed to consider the appropriate method for calculating CTLs in the hearing that we establish in this order. 
ii. Capacity Transfer Rights 
64. As noted earlier, ISO-NE proposes to allocate a portion of the Capacity Transfer Rights across the NEMA/Boston Import Interface (the transmission interface between the NEMA/Boston and Rest of Pool) to municipal utilities in NEMA/Boston that have ownership entitlements in pool planned units in Rest of Pool. TransCanada Power Marketing Ltd. (TransCanada) and Indicated Suppliers disagree with the proposal. TransCanada argues that this special award of Capacity Transfer Rights has no direct relationship to the actual load served by the municipal utilities in NEMA/Boston and improperly presumes that the municipal utilities should be given priority rights over the limited transfer capacity into the region. Indicated Suppliers argue that a “special allocation” of Capacity Transfer Rights should be extended to other participants with long-term contracts for capacity located outside of constrained areas. Conversely, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Company and Reading Municipal Light Department (MMWEC and Reading) urge the Commission to ensure that the “special” Capacity Transfer Right allocation be maintained as essential to any determination that the LICAP proposal is just and reasonable. MMWEC and Reading believe that any imposition of LICAP in New England should include a proper recognition of prior investments in pool planned units and should minimize the impact of a new regulatory paradigm upon those long-term investments. 
65. Duke Energy North American, LLC (Duke) seeks to clarify that generators that have increased transfer capability on constrained ICAP interfaces prior to the proposal's effective date would be allocated Capacity Transfer Rights as described in section 8.9.4 of the proposal. Additionally, MMWEC and Reading have uncovered two problems that they assert must be addressed. First, MMWEC and Reading believe that ISO-NE's proposed text of section 8.9.6 reads as though the allocation is to the pool planned unit itself. Second, in reviewing Table 1 to section 8.9.6, which lists the municipal utilities receiving special Capacity Transfer Rights, MMWEC and Reading believe that it does not include the Wakefield Municipal Gas & Light Department, which is a NEMA-based, municipal utility and thus entitled to a share of whatever Capacity Transfer Rights based on pool planned units allocation is accepted or approved by the Commission. 
66. Commission Response. Capacity Transfer Rights should be allocated in a way that allows the benefits of Capacity Transfer Rights to be received by those who ultimately pay the costs of the transmission system, including market participants that have funded specific upgrades that increased transfer capacity. That is because Capacity Transfer Rights depend on the amount of transmission capacity in New England, so those paying for the transmission capacity should receive its benefits. We endorsed a similar policy with respect to the allocation of Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs) in New England in an order issued December 20, 2002.[68] 
           ARRs entitle the holder to receive the revenues from the sale at auction of FTRs, which (like Capacity Transfer Rights) depend on the amount of transmission capacity in New England. 
67. This is not to say, however, that Capacity Transfer Rights must always be allocated to those who directly pay for the embedded costs of New England's transmission grid. Indeed, in the December 20, 2002 order, we accepted a proposal to allocate ARRs to “Congestion Paying LSEs,”[69] 
           even though not all Congestion Paying LSEs pay transmission costs. We did so because we expected that such Congestion Paying LSEs would pass on the benefits of ARRs to the retail loads that they serve, and these retail loads would ultimately also bear the costs of the transmission system.[70] 

           Similarly, we would find it acceptable to allocate Start Printed Page 33012Capacity Transfer Rights either to those who directly pay the fixed costs of the New England transmission system or to those who serve the retail loads that ultimately pay these fixed costs. However, as a general matter, we would not find it acceptable to allocate Capacity Transfer Rights to generators in Maine that have not contributed to the cost of the transmission system, although it would be acceptable to allocate Capacity Transfer Rights to generators in Maine (or in other regions of New England) that have contributed to the cost of the transmission system. 
68. The Commission is unable to determine whether ISO-NE's proposed allocation of Capacity Transfer Rights is consistent with this principle, and thus we will set for hearing the issue of the allocation of Capacity Transfer Rights. In particular, the hearing should determine whether, and to what extent, particular generators in Maine have paid for transmission upgrades that increase transfer capability with the rest of the pool and thus should be assigned corresponding Capacity Transfer Rights. The hearing should also determine the appropriate allocation of Capacity Transfer Rights for those LSEs, including municipal utilities, who are the original holders of life-of-the-unit contracts for pool planned units. The hearing should also address the extent to which LSEs outside of the import-constrained regions should be allocated Capacity Transfer Rights. 
3. Implementation Date and Transition Mechanisms 
69. ISO-NE's proposal relies on two transition mechanisms: (1) a transition payment of $5.34 per kilowatt month to be paid to those units in constrained sub-regions which had 2003 capacity factors of 15 percent or less, and (2) a series of price caps in import-constrained regions over a five-year phase-in period.[71] 
           After the fifth year (ending May 2009), the caps would expire, leaving prices in all sub-regions determined by the downward-sloping demand curve. During the phase-in period, the constrained sub-regions would clear at the higher of the cap or the price in the Rest of Pool sub-region. Numerous parties argue against the implementation of these transition mechanisms. 
70. Commission Response. For the reasons that follow, the Commission will reject the proposed transition mechanisms and the proposed transition payments. Instead, the Commission directs that the LICAP mechanism, when implemented by January 1, 2006, as directed by this order, become effective without the use of the phase-in or transition provisions. 
71. Several intervenors argued that the Commission should defer implementation of the LICAP proposal to accommodate the 18 month Regional Dialogue process that ISO-NE proposed. The Commission will defer implementation until January 1, 2006 but does not believe it would be appropriate to direct ISO-NE and stakeholders to develop a modified LICAP proposal in the Regional Dialogue process. The Commission directed ISO-NE and its stakeholders to develop a mechanism in the April 25 Order. However, these discussions did not produce consensus on a mechanism. Further, the Commission does not believe that ISO-NE's proposal, if implemented without modification, would resolve New England's Reliability Compensation Issues. Therefore, the Commission does not believe it is appropriate to delay action on ISO-NE's proposal to allow additional time for stakeholder discussions. Rather, the Commission believes that the approach taken in this order, which is to identify the date when LICAP will be implemented and establish proceedings to address remaining issues, will better address the situation. We believe that deferring the implementation of LICAP until January 1, 2006 will allow participants in import-constrained regions an opportunity to move toward the development of needed infrastructure prior to the realization of full LICAP rates. Infrastructure projects are proceeding in both Connecticut and NEMA/Boston and a deferral of LICAP should provide an incentive for timely completion of the addition of infrastructure in these areas. The Commission finds a delay in the implementation date of LICAP is preferable to the transition mechanisms proposed by ISO-NE, which were in large part simply out-of-market arrangements. To monitor the progress of infrastructure development, the Commission will require ISO-NE to submit a report to the Commission every 90 days, beginning 90 days from the date of this order, updating the progress made in the siting, permitting and construction of transmission and generation upgrades within the New England control area, with particular emphasis on progress within DCAs. While we recognize that ISO-NE is not the entity responsible for siting and permitting decisions, it is in the best position to keep the Commission informed regarding the progress of infrastructure development in New England. 
72. Until implementation, the New England market will continue to operate under the existing ICAP rules, as well as the existing PUSH mechanism, and any existing RMR agreements. If additional RMR contracts are needed or require renewal, the Commission expects the parties to those contracts and ISO-NE to negotiate, and file under section 205 of the FPA, one-term contracts, with the single term expiring when the LICAP mechanism is implemented. The Commission will consider the need for these contracts, and the justness and reasonableness of the rates proposed therein, as they are filed. While using current ICAP rules in the period between now and January 1, 2006 is not where the Commission envisioned the NEPOOL capacity market to be, the stakeholder process did not result in a mechanism that is just and reasonable and can be implemented in the near term. Our decision to delay implementation and rely on the existing rules and RMR agreements will produce a just and reasonable result in the short-term, while allowing changes to be made and infrastructure to be built, which will allow the basic LICAP framework we approve in this order to produce a just and reasonable result in the long-term. 
4. Miscellaneous Issues 
i. Mitigation Measures 
73. The mitigation measures proposed by ISO-NE did not elicit many comments or protests. LIPA argues that ISO-NE's proposed tests for de-listing units—which would require that the de-listing resource demonstrate that expected revenues or cost savings associated with the external sale or de-listing would exceed the expected revenues the resource would otherwise receive—will inhibit transactions between markets.[72] 

           LIPA asserts that there are multiple reasons for a resource to de-list beyond short term revenue tests, such as lower revenues that result from a longer-term capacity commitment or the perceived stronger creditworthiness of a commitment with an external party. PSEG requests that the Commission reject this mitigation measure, arguing that it would allow Start Printed Page 33013ISO-NE to employ a market power mitigation measure without any finding that the proposed actions would have a significant market impact, as with other mitigation rules. 
74. Commission Response: The Commission will accept the mitigation measures proposed by ISO-NE with respect to reference level calculations and conduct and impact thresholds but rejects the de-listing measures. Under ISO-NE's proposal, participants seeking to de-list any resource in an import-constrained ICAP region would be required to demonstrate to ISO-NE that the expected revenue associated with sale of ICAP outside of the NEPOOL control area or the expected cost savings attributable to de-listing will exceed the expected ICAP revenues and other market revenues that the resource would receive if it did not de-list. Where unable to make such a demonstration, ISO-NE proposes to have the authority to deny any delisting request. The Commission finds that ISO-NE should not have the authority to second-guess a generator's business decisions regarding whether to sell into the ICAP market and thus rejects this provision. Moreover, since participation in the ICAP market is voluntary, it is not appropriate to prohibit or limit a generator's decision to cease participating in the ICAP market. The Commission will not accept additional measures that are designed for the energy markets.[73] 
           These measures are primarily designed for units that receive transition payments. The Commission is eliminating transition payments. Consequently this proposed measure will not apply. 
ii. Role of the ISO 
75. ISO-NE has sought guidance on the issue of what entity should bear the responsibility for longer-term capacity procurement and long-term reliability. The Commission addressed a similar issue in the PJM Order. As a general matter, the Commission believes that the market design of the RTO or ISO should be structured to send appropriate price signals and thus provide an incentive for load to procure capacity to meet their long-term requirements. Through the regional transmission planning process and the determination of the appropriate ICAP requirements for LSEs, ISO-NE's role is to establish the infrastructure levels needed for the system to operate reliably. However, it is LSEs that have the primary responsibility for longer-term capacity procurement and obtaining sufficient supplies to ensure long-term reliability. The role of the RTO or ISO in this process is, at most, to provide a backstop to these efforts. However, the Commission is concerned that if an RTO or ISO negotiates contracts to procure power, it may assume an interest in market prices which could sacrifice its independence and change its incentives. Thus, the Commission would only consider a backstop role for the ISO or RTO after a showing that appropriate changes to the market design had been implemented and had not proven sufficient to solve the problem or that market design changes are infeasible. 
iii. Local Scarcity Pricing and a Co-Optimized Market for Energy and Operating Reserves 
76.0 We noted in the PJM Order that “recognizing short-term scarcity of operating reserves may be a valuable component of an overall market design. * * * The inclusion of such a feature could also in part reduce generator reliance upon unit specific agreements in situations where units needed for reliability are not recovering their costs and are eligible for a contract.”[74] 
           High locational prices in ISO-NE's spot markets can signal when and where there is a need for additional capacity. ISO-NE recently added a scarcity pricing feature to spot market rules for its markets whereby spot market prices would be increased, at times up to $1,000/MWh, during periods of scarce supplies, when New England as a whole is experiencing shortages of operating reserves.[75] 
           This pricing feature is valuable because it sends a strong signal when capacity is tight that capacity is needed. The resulting high prices also provide revenue to owners of generation capacity that is operated during a limited number of hours of very high demand, and thus, may reduce the need for RMR contracts for units that otherwise receive insufficient market revenue to support their operations.
77. ISO-NE's scarcity pricing is triggered only by New England-wide reserve shortages. However, because of transmission constraints, scarcity conditions may arise in smaller areas within New England (reflected in an inability to fully meet local reliability requirements) even when capacity throughout New England as a whole is sufficient to meet load and operating reserves. Any scarcity conditions that arise in smaller areas within New England do not trigger the scarcity pricing provisions. This feature may limit the ability of spot market prices to signal the need for additional capacity in local areas. Modifying ISO-NE's scarcity pricing mechanism so that prices would automatically increase in local areas that experience local scarcity conditions might improve the market's price signals and increase the ability of generators needed for local reliability to recover their costs in the market. Such a modification could complement and reinforce a LICAP mechanism. For example, local scarcity pricing could further encourage LSEs in a capacity-tight region to enter into contracts with resources in order to hedge against possible high spot energy prices. However, local scarcity pricing may be easier to implement in the presence of a locational operating reserves spot market that is co-optimized with the spot energy market, which would recognize operating reserve requirements in local areas. ISO-NE does not currently operate a locational operating reserves market, but it has indicated that it is planning to implement co-optimized energy and reserves markets in 2005. 
78. We wish to ensure that a broad array of options is considered for addressing New England's locational needs for capacity. Therefore, we will require ISO-NE to consider the advantages and disadvantages of modifying its existing scarcity pricing mechanism so that it would trigger as a result of local scarcity conditions. ISO-NE's process should include stakeholder input and consideration of stakeholder proposals. We will require ISO-NE to file a report on this investigation and the results of the stakeholder process within 180 days of this order. If ISO-NE files to implement co-optimized energy and reserves markets within 180 days of this order, it may elect to include the report on scarcity pricing as part of the filing.

Issued June 2, 2004
Joseph T. Kelliher, Commissioner concurring: 
I am writing separately to explain my views on the implementation date of a locational installed capacity (LICAP) market in New England. 
I concur with the order that a LICAP market should not be implemented before January 1, 2006. The purpose of establishing a LICAP market is to ensure there is adequate electricity generation in New England, particularly in Southwest Connecticut and Northeastern Massachusetts/Boston. The record shows that there is insufficient generation in these two areas of New England. 
For a LICAP market to be effective, the transmission system must be strong enough to permit generation interconnections. Unfortunately, the transmission system in Southwest Connecticut is notoriously weak, and at present cannot accommodate significant generation additions. 
It is important to give New England enough time to make necessary transmission upgrades. The order provides for an initial decision from an administrative law judge by June 1, 2005 to define the appropriate methodology for determining capacity transfer limits between ICAP regions, the amount and allocation of capacity transfer rights for purposes of each LICAP market, and the parameters of the demand curve that will apply in each ICAP region. The order also sets an implementation date for LICAP markets of January 1, 2006. I would have deferred selecting a specific implementation date for LICAP markets until after the initial decision. That would have given the Commission the flexibility to select an appropriate date for implementing LICAP based on an understanding of the progress—if any—towards strengthening the transmission grid in Southwest Connecticut and Northeastern Massachusetts/Boston. 
Until implementation of a LICAP market, the Commission will extend the Peaking Unit Safe Harbor (PUSH) mechanism, and consider reliability-must-run contracts to ensure generators receive just and reasonable compensation. Experience with the PUSH mechanism has proved disappointing, and reliability-must-run contracts may be the superior means to assure just and reasonable compensation during the interim.
Joseph T. Kelliher,

Commissioner.

     In particular, there are more generation resources within Maine than are necessary to meet local requirements within Maine or that can be exported from Maine. Additionally, ISO-NE has identified two areas Southwest Connecticut and Northeastern Massachusetts as being load pockets. Because of transmission constraints, there are limitations on the amount of power that can be imported into these regions. As a result, at times resources located within the load pockets must be used to meet demand in the load pockets.

     New England's capacity requirement is set at 12 percent above peak, while New York's is 18 percent above peak. New York's demand curve sets the price of capacity to zero at a surplus capacity value of 12 percent above Objective Capability, while New England's sets the value at 18 percent above. In each case the requirement is approximately 1.12 multiplied by 1.18, or about 1.32.

     Under these measures, mitigation could occur if a unit bid a predetermined amount above a reference price based on historical bids by the unit (conduct test) and if these bids were accepted it would result in a predetermined increase in the market price (impact test). To be mitigated, a unit's bids would have to be sufficiently high and have a sufficient impact on the market price to fail to satisfy both the conduct and impact test.

     For example, the New England Conference of Public Utility Commissioners (NECPUC) argues that the point on the demand curve where the price covers the net cost of a new peaker (net of inframarginal energy revenues) should be where capacity is just equal to New England's Objective Capability, which is less than ISO-NE's proposal. NECPUC also advocates setting the point where the ICAP price becomes zero (i.e., where the demand curve crosses the horizontal axis) at 110 percent of Objective Capability, rather than at 118 percent of Objective Capability as proposed by ISO-NE.

     The price at which generators would recover the cost of a peaking unit (net of energy market revenues) would be set at 100% of Objective Capability, rather than at 106.7 percent as proposed by ISO-NE. Second, the MW level at which the ICAP price would become $0 (i.e., where the demand curve crosses the horizontal axis) would be reduced to 112 percent of Objective Capability. This proposal would also impose additional requirements on generators. Finally, the proposal would also adopt locational operating reserve markets and fully integrate new generators receiving ICAP payments into the regional grid.

64.
     We note, for example, that the highest price for capacity in New England under ISO-NE's proposal (after the transition period has expired) would be about $9.28/kW-month, which is the price when the market clears at less than 95 percent of Objective Capability. By contrast, prices higher than $9.28 cleared the capacity market in the monthly auctions held by the NYISO for the summer 2004 capability period for Long Island and New York City. Specifically, the price for capacity on Long Island for June 2004 was $9.50, while the prices for capacity in New York City ranged between $11.16 and $11.42 for the months of June through October. (See, http://www.nyiso.com/​market/​icap_​auctions/​summer_​2004/​june_​2004_​auction.pdf.) The hearing should explore whether regions such as SWCT, which is near New York City and Long Island, would be able to attract adequate capacity under ISO-NE's proposed parameters if prices in New York City and Long Island exceed the highest possible price in New England.

     A Congestion Paying LSE is defined as “a Participant or Non-Participant that is responsible for paying for Congestion Costs as a Transmission Customer paying for Regional Network Service or Long-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service under the NEPOOL Tariff, unless such Transmission Customer has transferred its obligation to supply load in accordance with NEPOOL System Rules, in which case the Congestion Paying LSE shall be the Participant supplying the transferred load obligation.” See id. at P 55.

     In New England, Transmission Customers taking Regional Network Service or Long-Term Firm Point-to-Point Transmission Service pay rates that recover fixed transmission costs. However, not all Congestion Paying LSEs are such Transmission Customers who pay for transmission costs. Some Congestion Paying LSEs have taken over the responsibility for serving load from a Transmission Customer, while the Transmission Customer retains the responsibility to provide Transmission Service to the load and to pay the associated transmission costs. The Commission found it acceptable to allocate ARRs to Congestion Paying LSEs that do not pay transmission costs because the retail loads served by the Congestion Paying LSEs ultimately paid the transmission costs, and because the Commission expected that the benefits of the ARRs allocated to the LSEs would be flowed through to these same retail loads. Thus, the retail loads that ultimately paid transmission costs would also receive the benefits of the ARRs.

Using Advanced Search
 
    The Advanced Terms capability of our Compliance Expert puts the power of our Lucene-based search engine at your fingertips. 
    It provides you with multiple options for a more powerful and efficient search experience. 
    Importantly, though, by choosing to use Advanced Terms you render the dropdown filters in the Advanced Search null. 
    Hence, you only can use advanced terms or use the preset filters and keywords, but you cannot use both in the same search.
  

About Modifiers and Boolean Search Connectors

    Using the term modifiers below, you will be able to construct a rich query to find results for your search. First, some important background:
  

A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.
A Single Term is a single word such as "test" or "hello".
A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as "hello dolly".
Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query.


    Each term can be further revised by a term modifier:
  

Wildcard Searches

You can perform a wildcard search within a single term, but not within a phrase.
The single character wildcard search looks for terms that match that with the single character replaced. For example, to search for "text" or "test" you can use the search:
        te?t

Multiple character wildcard searches looks for zero or more characters. For example, to search for "test", "tests" or "tester", you can use the search:
        test*

You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term:
        te*t

Note, however, that you cannot use a * or ? symbol as the first character of a search.


Fuzzy Searches

    Fuzzy searches help find words that sound the same but are spelled differently (such as "roam" and "Rome"), 
    words that have alternative spellings("labor" and "labour"), 
    those that are misspelled, and those that include a base word but include prefixes and/or suffixes 
    (search results for the word "plan" will include "preplan" and "planning"). 
    To do a fuzzy search use the tilde symbol (~) at the end of a single-word term. 
    For example to search for a term similar in spelling to "roam" use the fuzzy search:
  

roam~


Proximity Searches

    You can find words that are within a specific distance away from one another. 
    To perform a proximity search, use the tilde symbol (~) followed by the number of words that can separate your search words. 
    For example:
  

"federal corporation"~2 will find "federal deposit insurance corporation".


Term Boosting

    If there is a term in your search query of particular importance, you can increase its relevance to the query using the carat operator (^"). 
    If you want to indicate that the word Treasury is more important in your search, use the query:
  

Treasury^5 guidance


    The higher the boost factor, the more relevant that term will be in your result set.
  

Boolean Operators

    Of course, the search query also supports the standard set of Boolean operators to specify how your search terms should be combined. 
    The default operator is OR, so if there is no operator specified, the query engine assumes an OR.
  

The OR operator links two terms and finds a matching document if either of the terms exist in a document.
The AND operator matches documents where both terms exist anywhere in the text of a single document.
The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term after NOT. It cannot be used with just one term specified in the search.
The NEAR operator links terms and finds a matching document if the terms are located within five words. 


Grouping

    We support using parentheses to group clauses to form sub-queries. 
    This can be useful if you want to control the Boolean logic for a query:
  

(federal AND guidance) OR regulation

Devon Power LLC, 137 FERC ¶61,073 (2011) 












137 FERC ¶ 61,073

		UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
		FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

		Before Commissioners: Jon Wellinghoff, Chairman; Philip D. Moeller, John R. Norris, and Cheryl A. LaFleur.

Devon Power LLC

		Docket No. ER03-563-067

		ORDER DENYING REHEARING

		(Issued October 20, 2011)

		1. On remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit),[1] the Commission issued an order in this proceeding in which it determined that the auction results and transition payments arising from a contested settlement approved by the Commission were tariff rates, not contract rates and that, nevertheless, the Commission had discretion to approve a settlement provision imposing a more stringent application of the statutory just and reasonable standard of review, commonly known as the Mobile Sierra “public interest” standard of review.[2]  The New England Power Generators Association, Inc. (NEPGA) and several other entities, collectively referred to as the Joint Applicants,[3] filed requests for rehearing of the Remand Order.  In this order, the Commission denies rehearing, as discussed below. 

I. Background

		2. Under section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), all rates associated with the transmission, sale or resale of electric energy in interstate commerce must be just and reasonable.[4]  The result of two Supreme Court cases, the Mobile-Sierra doctrine prescribes a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review under certain circumstances.[5]  Under the Mobile-Sierra doctrine, the Commission “must presume that the rate set out in a freely negotiated wholesale energy contract meets the [statutory] ‘just and reasonable’ requirement.”[6]  This presumption may be overcome only if the Commission concludes that the contract seriously harms the public interest.[7]

		3. In 2006, the Commission approved a contested settlement agreement redesigning the New England market for installed electric generation capacity (Settlement).[8]  The Settlement established a forward capacity market, which would use annual auctions to set the price of capacity.  In these auctions, capacity is procured three years in advance of its use, with the first auction procuring capacity for the one-year period beginning June 1, 2010.  To address the period between the effective date of the Settlement and June 1, 2010, the Settlement included a transition mechanism, which provided fixed payments to capacity assignments. 

		4. Of the 115 parties to the Settlement proceedings, eight opposed the Settlement.  Notwithstanding the opposition, the Commission approved the Settlement because, as a package, it presented a just and reasonable outcome for this proceeding consistent with the public interest.[9]  The Commission found that the Settlement provided a necessary solution to serious deficiencies in the New England market that were impairing critical infrastructure development and threatening reliability.[10]  Of particular interest here, section 4.C of the Settlement imposed the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard on certain future challenges to the auction results and transition payments.  The Commission found that this provision balanced the need for rate stability with the statutory requirement that rates be just and reasonable.[11]

		5. On appeal, the D.C. Circuit rejected most of the petitioners’ challenges to the Commission’s orders.  However, the court agreed with petitioners that applying the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard to challenges by non-settling parties “unlawfully deprived non-settling parties of their rights under the [Federal Power Act].”[12]

		6. The Supreme Court reversed that determination, finding that “the public interest standard is not, as the D.C. Circuit presented it, a standard independent of, and sometimes at odds with, the ‘just and reasonable standard’…; rather, the public interest standard defines ‘what it means for a rate to satisfy the just and reasonable standard in the contract context.’”[13]  The Supreme Court reasoned that Mobile-Sierra “is not limited to challenges to contract rates brought by contracting parties.  It applies, as well, to challenges initiated by third parties.”[14] Thus, the Commission must presume “that contract rates freely negotiated between sophisticated parties meet the just and reasonable standard.”[15]

		7. The Supreme Court remanded to the D.C. Circuit for further consideration, however, the question of whether the auction results and transition payments subject to the Mobile-Sierra clause in the Settlement are “contract rates” to which the Commission is required to apply the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” presumption.[16]  If not, the D.C. Circuit was to consider whether the Commission has discretion, under the circumstances, to approve the Settlement provision imposing the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard on future challenges to those results and payments.[17]

		8. On remand, the D.C. Circuit stated that the Commission had not articulated a rationale “for its discretion to approve a Mobile-Sierra clause outside the contract context, or an explanation for exercising that discretion here.”[18]  Accordingly, the court asked the Commission to explain “why, if the auction rates are not contract rates, they are entitled to Mobile-Sierra treatment.”  The court also asked the Commission to answer “[j]ust how do the auction rates reflect market conditions similar to freely-negotiated contract rates?  Or does the Commission base its asserted discretion on some other ground?”[19]

		9. In response to the D.C. Circuit’s Order, the Commission found that the settlement rates at issue here are not “contract rates” that, under Mobile-Sierra, require a presumption that the rates are statutorily just and reasonable.[20]  Nonetheless, the Commission concluded that it has the discretion to consider and decide whether future challenges to the settlement rates must overcome a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review.  The Commission found that, based on the circumstances of this proceeding, it was appropriate for the Commission to exercise that discretion in accepting the Mobile-Sierra provision in the underlying Settlement.

II. Requests for Rehearing

		10. As noted above, the Commission received two requests for rehearing of the Remand Order. 

		11. NEPGA contends that the Commission erred in finding that rates set in ISO-NE’s Forward Capacity Market are not contract rates; NEPGA argues that the rates are, indeed, contract rates.  NEPGA states that the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and leading treatises on contracts make clear that a sale by auction is a type of sales contract.  NEPGA explains that New England’s forward capacity auctions are “reverse auctions” in which sellers react to the “descending clock” auctioneer’s prices, but the results are still prices.  NEPGA further explains that these capacity auctions produce binding mutual obligations to provide and pay for a specific quantity of capacity at a specific time.

		12. NEPGA also contends, that the competitive nature of auctions creates a multilateral process of suppliers and bidders that is more akin to bilateral arrangements in contracts than rates set unilaterally by tariff.  NEPGA explains that, unlike a unilateral tariff rate, capacity auction prices are not dictated by a single seller who is free to propose new rules or results.  NEPGA further contends that, unlike unilateral rates filed by sellers, auctions impose an obligation on suppliers to deliver a specific product at a specific price, place, and time.  NEPGA also points out that the Commission’s regulations provide that contracts can create tariffs and that tariffs can contain contracts in the form of rate schedules and service agreements.[21]

		13. NEPGA further contends, in support of its claim that the rates are contract rates, that the forward capacity auctions represent contract rates regardless of the opposition to the underlying Settlement.  NEPGA states that the Commission approved the Settlement and so imposed an auction mechanism.  NEPGA likens Commission approval of the Settlement to other changes the Commission has made to its rules despite significant opposition and, in doing so, requires rates previously set by contract to be abrogated or modified.[22]  NEPGA also points out that the rehearing requests filed in response to the Commission’s approval of the Settlement did not challenge the auction mechanism as a rate methodology, but rather the standard of review that would be applied to auction results.  NEPGA further contends that, if opposition to the Settlement was dispositive of the question of whether Forward Capacity Auction results are contract rates, then the Supreme Court would not have remanded that question. 

		14. NEPGA also argues that the contractual nature of capacity auction obligations is not undermined by the fact that the auctions are mandatory and conducted according to rules set forth in ISO-NE’s tariff.  NEPGA explains that all auctions run according to some system of rules just as all contracts are struck within a system of rules (such as the UCC).  NEPGA also contends that the auction results are not mandatory because, as the D.C. Circuit has observed, load has various options for meeting its forward capacity market obligations.[23]

		15. NEPGA also disputes the Commission’s finding that the Forward Capacity Auction does not produce contract rates because utilities buying capacity in the forward capacity market cannot be said to be contracting with the capacity sellers.  NEPGA contends that when ISO-NE purchases capacity from sellers it is either for itself or acting as an agent for entities that must fulfill capacity obligations.  NEPGA further contends that the Commission’s holding is contrary to statements made by the Commission in Order No. 741[24] and other orders regarding the role of Independent System Operators and Regional Transmission Organizations as contracting counterparties in market transactions, including capacity auctions.[25]  NEPGA also points out that in a rehearing order in this proceeding, the Commission rejected an argument that market rules and tariffs are not contracts to which Mobile-Sierra can apply.[26]  NEPGA contends that the Commission has failed to reconcile its findings in the Remand Order with its previous findings in this proceeding. 

		16. Finally, NEPGA argues that the Commission’s discussion of transition rates is outside the scope of the remand.  NEPGA states that, although the Supreme Court remanded the questions whether the auction results and the transition payments are contract rates,[27] the D.C. Circuit held that remand was moot with regard to the transmission payments.[28]

		17. By contrast, the Joint Applicants support the Commission’s determination that the auction results and transition payments were tariff, not contract rates.  The Joint Applicants contend, though, that the Commission erred in concluding that it has the discretion and authority to apply a Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review to future challenges to those tariff rates as if they were, in fact, contract rates.  They state that the Supreme Court has rejected arguments that sought to ground Mobile-Sierra in the Commission’s approval of public utility rates.  Specifically, the Joint Applicants point out that, in Morgan Stanley, the Court dismissed contentions that Mobile-Sierra could not apply because the Commission had never reviewed the market-based rate agreements at issue in that case.[29]

		18. The Joint Applicants also contend that the Remand Order wrongly suggests that the Commission has discretion to estop future Commissions from modifying the rates absent serious future harm to the public interest.  The Joint Applicants explain that Morgan Stanley rejected such an estoppel view of Mobile-Sierra.  They state that the Supreme Court reaffirmed in both NRG andMorgan Stanley that the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard operates only in a contract context.  The Joint Applicants contend that, because the auction rates are not contract rates, there is no contractual agreement that imbues the rates with reasonableness, and there is no contract-stability interest to protect.

		19. The Joint Applicants disagree with the Commission’s assertion that because the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” test is one application of the statute’s “just and reasonable” language, the Commission has the discretion to choose to apply that more rigorous standard outside the contract context.  The Joint Applicants explain that the Supreme Court has made clear that the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” test for contract-rate changes only provides “the definition of what it means for a rate to satisfy the just-and-reasonable standard in the contract context.”[30]  In addition, the Joint Applicants contend that the Commission’s confidence in the ability of the market-based features of the forward capacity auction to produce just and reasonable results derives not from the consent of the buyers and sellers, as it would in a contract context, but instead in the Commission’s faith in the tariff rules creating those rates.  Using this logic, the Joint Applicants argue that the Commission could apply the more stringent Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review in every non-contract case without any legal basis to distinguish between market-based capacity prices as compared to all other market-based rate mechanisms currently setting rates in New England and throughout the nation.  Finally, the Joint Applicants argue that the Commission is wrong to limit a future Commission’s discretion to review tariff rates absent a showing of serious harm to the public interest.

III. Discussion

		20. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission denies rehearing.  NEPGA argues that the Commission erred in considering the rates at issue as anything other than contract rates, which would be subject to a Mobile-Sierra “public interest” presumption of reasonableness, while the Joint Applicants argue that the Commission erred in suggesting that the rates at issue here, while they are tariff rates, can nevertheless be made subject to the more stringent application of the statutory just and reasonable standard of review, commonly known as the Mobile Sierra “public interest” standard of review.  We reject both arguments.

A. Contract vs. Tariff Rates

		21. The Commission reaffirms its findings that the rates set by the forward capacity auctions represent tariff, not contract, rates and that, therefore, they are not entitled to a presumption that they are just and reasonable.  The Commission does not dispute, as NEPGA point out, that conventional auctions can result in a contract between a buyer and a seller.[31]  However, the rates produced by these capacity auctions nevertheless are tariff, not contract, rates; the rates produced by the forward capacity auction are, in fact, determined unilaterally by the ISO-NE tariff.[32]

		22. The results of the capacity auctions, although possessing certain contractual characteristics, do not constitute contracts between buyers and sellers.  The “demand” or “load” side of each auction is set not by the load-serving entities that ultimately pay for the capacity, but by ISO New England, Inc. (ISO-NE), which determines the estimated amount of capacity – known as the installed capacity requirement – that the system as a whole will require for reliability three years in the future.[33]  ISO-NE then announces the auction starting price, which is initially twice the estimated cost of new entry, and capacity providers state how much capacity they would offer at that price.  If more capacity is offered than required to meet the installed capacity requirement, ISO-NE employs a “descending clock” process, lowering the offering price until the quantity of capacity offered equals the installed capacity requirement.  ISO-NE then assesses each utility a capacity charge equal to the utility’s share of the installed capacity requirement multiplied by the market clearing price. 

		23. Thus, although a conventional auction can result in a contract between the buyer and seller,[34] the forward capacity auctions bear little resemblance to a conventional auction.  The utilities “buying” capacity in the forward capacity market have no role in the auction at all, and cannot be said to be “contracting” with the capacity sellers; indeed, it can be said that they themselves are not “buying” capacity but rather are merely paying the rate that ISO-NE charges to recover ISO-NE’s costs of buying capacity.  That is, rather than agreeing to pay a specific seller an amount set by a voluntary bid for a particular property – as in a conventional auction – the “buyers” in the forward capacity auction are assessed a standard rate, based upon the intersection of the installed capacity requirement set by ISO-NE and the offers made by the capacity sellers.  While the bids of the capacity sellers commit them to supply the amount they offer at the clearing price, there is nothing that can be reasonably viewed as voluntary agreements of any sort between the sellers of the capacity and the “buyers” in the auction.  Thus, the standard capacity charge paid by each “buying” utility in the system for its share of the installed capacity requirement more closely resembles a tariff rate paid to ISO-NE to compensate ISO-NE for costs that ISO-NE has incurred. 

		24. Moreover, it cannot be said that ISO-NE is acting as an agent for capacity buyers.  Although the Forward Capacity Auction creates a multilateral process of suppliers and bidders, the ultimate purchases are made unilaterally via ISO-NE’s tariff.  ISO-NE is at the center of this capacity market.  Through its forward auctions it procures capacity to meet its installed capacity requirement.  Under ISO-NE’s tariff, load-serving entities then pay ISO-NE for that capacity.  Moreover, as NEPGA points out, the auction results are not per se mandatory because load has options for meeting its forward capacity obligations, including the ability to self-supply capacity.  Thus, there is no contractual obligation for load to fulfill its capacity obligations directly through the auctions.  Under the Commission’s regulations, a rate schedule may take the form of a contract but, in this instance, ISO-NE’s tariff does not create a contractual obligation by buyers to purchase capacity from sellers of that capacity.  To the contrary, the standard capacity charge paid by each utility in the ISO-NE system for its share of the installed capacity requirement more closely resembles a tariff rate.   

		25. Non-settling parties are equally obligated to pay the rates derived from the rate methodology resulting from the Settlement.  These obligations arise because the Commission found that the Settlement and the resulting market rules were just and reasonable, not because the non-settling parties are subject to any contractual obligations under the Settlement.  By choosing to purchase capacity through the forward capacity auctions, these non-settling parties are obligated to make payments under ISO-NE’s tariff. 

		26. We find NEPGA’s arguments with regard to the consistency of the Remand Order with Order No. 741 and other orders to be similarly unpersuasive.  In Order No. 741, the Commission addressed credit reforms in organized wholesale electric markets by, inter alia, requiring each independent system operator (ISO) or regional transmission organization (RTO) to file tariff revisions to protect against the bankruptcy of a market participant.[35]  The Commission offered several options for ISOs and RTOs to comply with this requirement, including the development of tariff revisions that would establish the ISO or RTO to act as the central counterparty to transactions with market participants.[36]  That does not mean that there is a direct contractual relationship between sellers of capacity and buyers of capacity.  More recently, the Commission conditionally accepted tariff revisions filed by PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) designating PJM as a counterparty to transactions with market participants.[37]  In those revisions, PJM defines counterparty as establishing PJM “as the contracting party, in its name and own right and not as an agent, to an agreement or transaction with Market Participants or other entities, including the agreements and transactions with customers regarding transmission service and other transactions under the PJM Tariff….”[38]

		27. In any event, any discussion of whether ISO-NE will choose to act as counterparty in market transactions is speculative because the Commission has extended the filing deadline for the tariff revisions until January 31, 2012.  Nevertheless, even if ISO-NE chooses to designate itself as the official counterparty, that does not necessarily create a contractual relationship between sellers and buyers.  As discussed above, the terms of purchase through the forward capacity auction are set unilaterally by tariff.[39]  ISO-NE may purchase capacity to meet its installed capacity requirement, and ISO-NE establishes rates for this capacity in its tariff, but that does not create a contractual relationship between generators and load-serving entities. 

		28. Finally, although the D.C. Circuit found that any controversy related to the transition payments paid to generators was moot, the Commission included the transition payments in its analysis of the auction rates because they both were derived from the Settlement.  We recognize here, however, as we did in the Remand Order,[40] that the last transition payment was made over a year ago and, therefore, the controversy as to whether these payments represent contract or tariff rates is now moot. 

B. Commission Discretion to Accept “Public Interest” Standard

		29. The Commission also denies rehearing regarding its discretion to accept application of a Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review.  Under Mobile-Sierra, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Morgan Stanley, the Commission must presume that rates set by power sales contracts that are freely negotiated at arm’s-length between willing buyers and sellers meet the statutory “just and reasonable” standard.[41]  This presumption may be overcome only if the Commission concludes that the underlying rate “adversely affect[s] the public interest.”[42]  Thus, this “public interest” presumption demands a more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard when the Commission reviews rates, terms and conditions of freely negotiated power sales contracts, both on initial review and if and when those rates, terms and conditions are later challenged.  Nevertheless, the “public interest” presumption is not a different standard of review; rather, “the term … refers to the differing application of [the statutory] just-and-reasonable standard,” which is the only statutory standard of review

		under the FPA.[43] Thus, rather than being an extra-statutory test, separate and apart from the “just and reasonable” standard, the “public interest” presumption represents a point on a broad continuum of approaches employed to meet the statute’s requirement that rates, terms and conditions be just and reasonable.

		30. Morgan Stanley makes clear that the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” presumption applies only to contract rates, and Morgan Stanley does not address the Commission’s discretion to accept different applications of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard for non-contract rates.  The Supreme Court has explained that the “just and reasonable” standard is the only statutory standard under the FPA for assessing wholesale rates, whether set by contract or tariff.[44]  Under this statutory “just and reasonable” standard, the Commission is not “bound to any one ratemaking formula;”[45] rather, the Commission must interpret, and necessarily has the discretion to interpret, how this statutory standard is to be implemented.[46]  Indeed, because “[t]he statutory requirement that rates be ‘just and reasonable’ is obviously incapable of precise judicial definition,” courts have long “afforded great deference to the Commission in its rate decisions.”[47]  That is, the FPA requires only that rates be just and reasonable; it does not specify the manner in which that general formulation must be implemented in any particular context.  

		31. Given the flexibility inherent in the statutory “just and reasonable” standard, the Commission may require varying types and degrees of justification for challenges to particular rates or practices, depending on the circumstances.  When power sales rates are set by contracts resulting from fair, arm’s-length negotiations between willing sellers and buyers, Sierra and the more recent Morgan Stanley require application of the more rigorous “public interest” presumption when the Commission is faced with a challenge to such contractually agreed-to rates.  Nothing in the FPA or in the court opinions related to this proceeding, however, precludes the Commission from applying a similar more rigorous standard when faced with challenges to other rates, as a matter of discretion, if considerations relevant to what is “just and reasonable” make that approach appropriate. 

		32. Because the Settlement rates at issue in this proceeding are not contract rates, there is no presumption that the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review should apply.  Nonetheless, the Commission determined that it would be appropriate to accept the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” language in part because of the similarities between the Settlement rates and contract rates.  The Commission determined that, although these forward capacity auctions will not result in contracts between buyers and sellers, they share with freely-negotiated contracts certain market-based features that tend to assure just and reasonable rates.[48]  In particular, the Commission found that the auctions provide a market-based mechanism to appropriately value capacity resources based on their location, satisfying cost-causation principles.[49]  The forward-looking nature of the Forward Capacity Market provides appropriate signals to investors when infrastructure resources are necessary, with sufficient lead time to allow that infrastructure to be put into place before reliability is sacrificed.[50]  And the locational component of the Forward Capacity Market ensures that the addition of new infrastructure is targeted to where reliability concerns are most critical.[51]

		33. In addressing the justness and reasonableness of the Settlement, the Commission determined that acceptance of the Settlement, including its “public interest” standard of review, would promote consumer welfare by balancing the need for rate stability and the interests of the diverse entities who participate in the Forward Capacity Market.[52]  The Commission found that stability is particularly important in this case, which was initiated in part because of the unstable nature of the former installed capacity revenues and the effect that has on generating units, particularly those critical to maintaining reliability.[53]  In addition, as noted above, the Commission found that the forward-looking nature of the Forward Capacity Market will provide appropriate signals to investors when new infrastructure resources are necessary with sufficient lead time to allow that infrastructure to be put into place before reliability is sacrificed.[54]  The Commission also found that the Settlement comported with expressed intent of Congress regarding this case.[55]

		34. The Commission’s acceptance of the Settlement, as a package, was consistent with Commission precedent.[56]  In Trailblazer, the Commission identified four approaches it could use to address a contested settlement.[57]  The Commission determined that it was appropriate to apply the second Trailblazer approach in addressing this Settlement.  Accordingly, the Commission found that the parties objecting to the Settlement Agreement would “be in no worse position under the terms of the settlement than if the case were litigated,” and that the Settlement, as a package, achieves an overall just and reasonable result within a zone of reasonableness.[58]  In particular, the Commission found that the Settlement resolved the issues raised in this proceeding concerning the under-compensation of capacity resources in New England, and provided the appropriate market structure to:  (1) ensure that generating resources are appropriately compensated based on their location and contribution to system reliability; and (2) provide incentives to attract new infrastructure when and where needed.[59]  Thus, the Commission appropriately exercised its discretion under the FPA to accept the Settlement, including its more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard because the Settlement presented an overall just and reasonable result consistent with the requirements of section 205 of the FPA.

		35. Moreover, the Commission found that the Settlement might not have been reached without the inclusion of the “public interest” standard of review provided in section 4.C.[60]  The Commission initiated these proceedings in response to the compensation problems faced by generating resources that are needed for reliability but could not obtain sufficient revenues in the markets to continue operation.  If the Settlement had not been reached, many of the deficiencies within the ISO-NE market would have persisted and ISO-NE might not have been able to retain the resources needed for reliability.  In addition, an already protracted litigation involving over 175 representatives would have continued and would have cause further instability in the ISO-NE market thereby thwarting other market enhancements.[61]

		36. Accepting the application of the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review to the Settlement, we recognize, will make it more difficult to challenge in future cases the justness and reasonableness of the Settlement; i.e., the Commission will not act absent a showing of serious public harm.  This is not an action that the Commission took, or takes, lightly.  In a recent order approving an uncontested settlement, the Commission directed the settling parties to modify their settlement so as not to impose the “public interest” standard of review on future changes proposed by the Commission and non-settling parties.[62]  The Commission found that the circumstances of the HIOS settlement did not rise to the compelling level of those present in Devon Power so as to warrant binding the Commission and non-settling third parties to a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard of review.[63]  Since HIOS, the Commission has issued other orders accepting uncontested settlements in which it has directed the settling parties to remove Mobile-Sierra provisions because we found that the circumstances of those settlements did not rise to the compelling level as those present in this proceeding.[64]

		37. Thus, the Commission has judged, and intends to judge, various proposed applications of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard, including the Mobile-Sierra “public interest” standard of review, on a case-by-case basis.  The Commission will accept a more stringent application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard only when the applicant can demonstrate compelling circumstances, such as those found in this proceeding, that merit such protection from challenges.[65]  We will not use our discretion to accept a more rigorous application of the statutory “just and reasonable” standard unless we find, based on the facts presented, that the package offers sufficient benefits to consumers to warrant taking such action.  The Commission’s assessment, as in any statutory just and reasonable analysis, must be responsive to the arguments presented and based on the administrative record compiled.

		38. Moreover, even when, as in the particular circumstances presented here, the Commission does decide to exercise its discretion and apply a more stringent standard of review to govern future challenges, that action also does not mean that, in response to future challenges to a rate, the Commission will be unable to review the rate.[66]    We will respond as necessary to the threat of serious harm to the public interest.[67]  The Commission has taken such action in the past,[68] and retains the ability to do so in the future.
