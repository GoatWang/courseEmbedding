About Us
 



Ceterix® Orthopaedics is singularly focused on meniscal preservation and is dedicated to providing patients every opportunity to maintain the natural health and stability of their knee. The company develops tools that help surgeons repair many of the tears that currently remain untreated or are treated by meniscectomy (meniscus removal), a procedure associated with increased risk of arthritis or total knee replacement later in life. The Ceterix NovoStitch® Plus Meniscal Repair System provides surgeons with the unique ability to repair horizontal, radial, root and other complex tears. Based in Fremont, Calif., the company is backed by investors Novo Ventures, Versant Ventures and 5AM Ventures.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Suture Passer/NovoStitch Ceterix Orthopaedics,  Inc.
Ceterix Orthopaedics Raises $18 Million for Meniscus Repair

Ceterix Orthopaedics,  Inc. has raised $18 million in a new round of funding to expand the market for its minimally invasive surgical tools.
The technology enables surgeons to place stitches in very tight joint compartments,  while protecting sensitive surrounding structures such as nerves,  arteries and cartilage. This technology has applications in numerous procedures in knees,  hips,  and shoulders.
The company,  formerly known as SuturePro Technologies,  Inc. released its first product last year,  aimed initially at helping doctors fix tears of the knee's meniscus,  rather than removing the cartilage and potentially damaging nerves and other structures. According to the company,  more than 100 physicians in the U.S. use the tools.
The procedure was developed by Justin Saliman,  M.D. an orthopedic surgeon at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles.
"Due to the difficulty of access and the limitations of current arthroscopic instruments,  the vast majority of meniscal tears are not repaired but are either partially or totally resected, " said John McCutcheon,  Ceterix's president and CEO,  in a 2013 press release. "This means that almost a million patients each year are undergoing procedures that will significantly increase their risk of osteoarthritis later in life."
Previous investors Novo A/S,  Versant Ventures and 5AM Ventures participated in the round,  which also included debt financing from Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance. Armentum Partners acted as financial advisor to Ceterix in the transaction.
In addition,  Ceterix announced the issuance of two key U.S. patents,  related to methods of meniscal and soft tissue repair with its proprietary technology.
The Menlo Park,  California,  company,  founded in 2010,  was backed by investors Novo Ventures,  Versant Ventures and 5AM Ventures with $19.5 million in a Series B venture financing in January 2013.
Kevin Stone,  M.D.,  a San Francisco knee surgeon and advocate of biologic solutions for knee repair,  told OTW,  "While we love tools that help us place sutures in hard to reach places,  buyers beware. As orthopedic surgeons we are good at continually coming up with novel ways to do it and the patent protection on our small iterations is very vulnerable. Translated: you will see multiple variations each year. So exit quickly." Dr. Stone is the founder of Aperion Biologics,  Inc.
