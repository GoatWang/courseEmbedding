Harvard Bioscience, Inc. Launches New ADMET Product
HOLLISTON, Mass., Feb. 27 /PRNewswire/ -- Harvard Bioscience, Inc.
(Nasdaq: HBIO) today announced the introduction of ScanTox, a drug safety
evaluation tool that provides a more sensitive means of lead optimization than
currently available, as well as an in vitro alternative to the much criticized
Draize irritancy test using live animals.


    (Photo:      http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010227/NETU050-a


                 http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20010227/NETU050LOGO-b)


    ScanTox is designed to reduce the number of drug candidate "false
positives" inexpensively before reaching high-cost pre-clinical and clinical
trials (Phase II/III).  ScanTox is a laser-based instrument that
quantifies the relative cytotoxicity of a substance within a living and
functional cultured bovine lens.  With high repeatability ScanTox measures
organ functionality of this system, and in turn can be used to measure
recovery from toxic agents even at parts per million concentrations.


    "We believe ScanTox is a breakthrough product. It perfectly fits our
strategy of providing higher relevance and speed at lower cost," said David
Green, President of Harvard Bioscience.  " For anyone interested as well in
accuracy and reproducibility, or concerned with reducing the use of live
animals in research and industry, this product is a significant innovation.
Like many of our products, ScanTox can substantially reduce product time
to market.  During March 26 through 28 we will be demonstrating ScanTox at
the Society of Toxicology trade show in San Francisco and in June we will be
at the Congress on In Vitro Biology meeting in St Louis."


    Harvard Bioscience is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of
innovative, enabling tools in drug discovery research at pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, universities and government laboratories.  HBIO sells
approximately 10,000 products to thousands of researchers in over 60 countries
though its 1,000 page catalog, and through its distributors, the most notable
of which is AP Biotech.  HBIO has sales and manufacturing operations in the
United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany with sales facilities in France
and Canada.


    Statements in this release that relate to expectations and objectives of
management for future operations of Harvard Bioscience, Inc., or that
otherwise relate to future performance, are forward looking statements.
Actual results may differ from those projected as a result of product demand,
pricing, market acceptance, economic conditions, intellectual property issues,
competitive products, risks in product and technology development, and other
risks identified in our Securities and Exchange Commission fillings.


    For information on ScanTox, please call Derek Palmer at (508) 893-
8066.   Press releases and our product catalog can be found on our web site,

History[edit]
Harvard Bioscience was founded in 1901. Frustrated by the poor quality of equipment then available, Dr. William T. Porter began manufacturing his own high quality physiology teaching equipment in the basement of the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Porter went on to found the American Journal of Physiology and became one of the leading physiologists of his day. His equipment gained an enviable reputation for quality and reliability and began to be known simply as the Harvard Apparatus.
In the early 1980s, the company started using the name Harvard Bioscience; the name was not officially changed to Harvard Bioscience, Inc. until 2000. The company completed their initial public offering in December 2000. The names Harvard Apparatus and Harvard Bioscience are used pursuant to a license agreement between Harvard University and Harvard Bioscience, Inc.[3]
Products[edit]
Harvard Bioscience offers a wide array of products for life science research. Their product portfolio is broken into five market segments: Fluidics, Laboratory Equipment & Supplies, Molecular Analysis, Cell Analysis, and Physiology.[4]
Finance[edit]
The revenue of the company grew from $11.5 million in 1997 to $108.2 million in 2010, a CAGR of 19%.[5] The revenue of the company for fy 2013 reached 105.57 million with the profit margin of 0.12% and operation margin of -1.01%.[6] On November 13, 2013, Harvard Bioscience Inc. announced its allocation of tax basis for spin-off of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology.[7]

History[edit]
Harvard Bioscience was founded in 1901. Frustrated by the poor quality of equipment then available, Dr. William T. Porter began manufacturing his own high quality physiology teaching equipment in the basement of the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Porter went on to found the American Journal of Physiology and became one of the leading physiologists of his day. His equipment gained an enviable reputation for quality and reliability and began to be known simply as the Harvard Apparatus.
In the early 1980s, the company started using the name Harvard Bioscience; the name was not officially changed to Harvard Bioscience, Inc. until 2000. The company completed their initial public offering in December 2000. The names Harvard Apparatus and Harvard Bioscience are used pursuant to a license agreement between Harvard University and Harvard Bioscience, Inc.[3]
Products[edit]
Harvard Bioscience offers a wide array of products for life science research. Their product portfolio is broken into five market segments: Fluidics, Laboratory Equipment & Supplies, Molecular Analysis, Cell Analysis, and Physiology.[4]
Finance[edit]
The revenue of the company grew from $11.5 million in 1997 to $108.2 million in 2010, a CAGR of 19%.[5] The revenue of the company for fy 2013 reached 105.57 million with the profit margin of 0.12% and operation margin of -1.01%.[6] On November 13, 2013, Harvard Bioscience Inc. announced its allocation of tax basis for spin-off of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology.[7]
