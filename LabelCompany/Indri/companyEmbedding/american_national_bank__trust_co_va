It was founded in 1909 by my great grandfather H.O. Kerns, Sr. If his photo is any indication, he was a tough, fair business man......all about the business. I am that way, too. I live in the same area in which he lived (Sutherlin, VA) and he is buried at Kerns Church Cemetery near my home.  My Daddy, M.V. Kerns is buried there, too. I have Sutherlin in my D.N.A. going back hundreds of years and American National Bank is an example of Kerns hard work and determination. I am proud it is an outstanding bank today. 展开Emily Sakellaris · 2016年12月12日Obviously this is not a bank we can trust with our money. They allow unauthorized transactions, and refuse to dispute them. When making an online payment, they ...allowed the other company to withdraw the money TWICE. When asked to dispute it, AMNB refused to do so. I will no longer support an establishment that does not take care of their customers and gives terrible customer service. 展开Alice Abbott · 2017年6月14日Best costumer service ever! Each person has been so helpfulMark Whitmore · 2017年7月11日Treated me disgustingly, had no idea what they were doing, very racist towards me.Cindy Kaake · 2016年10月25日Thanks to Michelle and American National Bank for the great job they did when my bank card was used without authorization.  Professional, fast and solved the problem in 20 minutes.Bob Whitt · 2014年9月12日Just wanted to comment on the young man that waited on me this morning at amnb  downtown he was courteous and friendly and gave me outstanding service that's the reason I continue to bank hereKathryn Maiko Polk · 2015年11月16日A great company to work for.  Everyone is so kind.   They contribute and participate in many charity events. American National truely cares about it's customers, employees, and local communities.  Awesome bank!!Nancy Thomas Moss · 2015年8月15日I just had the worst experience trying to get help to check an see if someone had used my card. Went through 3 people no one could check it. First girl was rude an you couldn't understand anything she said.Michael Lyon2014年1月6日American National Bank has been most professional and accomidiating to our business needs as we've grown our company from one to three businesses!  Thank you ANB.Betty Rakes Newman · 2014年1月10日Love the friendly staff.

It's the easy, secure and private way to pay with a simple touch.American National Bank & Trust Company · 7月17日 04:24 · We are excited to announce that Karen Tilley will be joining the team as manager of its Winston-Salem branch. Tilley is a seasoned banking professional and has previously worked for 18 years at Lexington State Bank/NewBridge Bank. She attended Surry Community College in Dobson, North Carolina and has completed numerous AIB courses. “I love the concept of community banking and am very happy to be a part of American National and continuing to serve the Winston-Salem market, " s...ays Tilley.
