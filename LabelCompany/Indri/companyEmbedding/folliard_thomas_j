CarMax Inc. CEO Tom Folliard will retire by the end of the year, the used-car retailer said today.
Folliard, 51, will be succeeded by Bill Nash, 46, the executive vice president of human resources who was promoted to president effective today as part of a succession plan.
The largest U.S. used-car retailer also said Cliff Wood, 49, executive vice president of stores, was promoted to COO today.
“Tom Folliard has built an exceptional management team at CarMax, positioning the company for continued growth,” Bill Tiefel, chairman of CarMax’s board of directors, said in a statement. “The execution of our long-term succession plan, with Bill as president and Cliff as COO, ensures a seamless management transition and the continuity of the company’s culture.”
The succession plan was announced as CarMax’s stock has fallen about 25 percent over the last three months, compared with a 7.8 percent drop for the S&P 500. Shares were down 4 percent in early trading today to $42.41 per share. CarMax shares were trading for as high as $74.73 in April.
Folliard became president and CEO of CarMax in 2006. The Richmond, Va., retailer said its store base and revenue have doubled in that time, while its net income has quadrupled.
Folliard is expected to become the nonexecutive chairman of the board upon retirement.
Nash has served as head of human resources since 2012 and served as the company’s vice president and senior vice president of merchandising between 2007 and 2011. He joined the company in 1997 after working as an accountant with Circuit City Stores Inc.
Nash “is a highly talented leader with experience in all aspects of our business and is the right choice to guide CarMax through the next phase of our growth and development,” Folliard said in the statement.
Wood has overseen the company’s sales, service and merchandising since 2012 and has been with CarMax since 1993.

Folliard, 61, a Washington native and retired college basketball coach who took three different teams to the NCAA Division II tournament, died of cancer Sept. 28 at Georgetown University Hospital. He lived in Washington. Mr. Folliard, a graduate of Gonzaga High School and nephew of the late Washington Post reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner Edward T. Folliard, played basketball for Providence College. He was a member of the Friars' 1961 National Invitational Tournament championship team. His collegiate teammates included future Georgetown University men's basketball coach John Thompson, future NBA player and coach Lenny Wilkens and future U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and Boston mayor Ray Flynn. Mr. Folliard graduated from Providence, then served two years in the Army before he left active duty as a first lieutenant to start a career as a basketball coach. He was basketball coach and athletic director at Bryant College in Smithfield, R.I., from 1968 to 1978; basketball coach and athletic director at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass., from 1978 to 1984; and basketball coach at Florida Institute of Technology from 1984 until his retirement in 1991. In 1990, Mr. Folliard's Florida Tech team had a season record of 25-2 and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen of the Division II tournament. His career record was 399 wins and 212 losses. He was inducted into the Stonehill College and Bryant College halls of fame and was named coach of the year in 1990 by the Sunshine State Conference and the Division II South District. After retiring from coaching, Mr. Folliard returned to Washington, where he was director of sales and marketing for Barclay Career School. Later, he directed marketing and admissions at the Technical Education Center in Rockville, and for the past two years, worked as a senior loan officer for Accubanc Mortgage Corp. in Bethesda. His marriage to his first wife, Audrey Folliard, of 35 years, ended in divorce. His second wife, Susan Carroll Folliard, died in 1994. Survivors include four children from his first marriage, Denise Sousa of Palm Bay, Fla., Susan MacLean of North Attleboro, Mass., Thomas J. Folliard IV of Richmond and Kevin J.
