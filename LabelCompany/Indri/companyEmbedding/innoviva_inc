GlaxoSmithKline plc and Innoviva, Inc. Submits EU Filing for Extended Use of Relvar Ellipta in Patients with Controlled Asthma on an ICS/LABA Combination
Jul 21 17
GlaxoSmithKline plc and Innoviva, Inc. announced a submission to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the extended use of once-daily Relvar Ellipta (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, FF/VI), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) /long-acting ß2-agonist (LABA) combination, in patients already adequately controlled on an ICS/LABA combination. FF/VI is currently indicated in Europe for the regular treatment of patients aged 12 and over with asthma who are not adequately controlled on both ICS and 'as-needed' short-acting ß2-agonist (SABA) and where use of a combination product (ICS and LABA) is appropriate. The proposed indication, would also include those patients already adequately controlled on an ICS/LABA combination. The submission includes positive data from a previously reported1 non-inferiority lung function study which concluded that patients who have well-controlled asthma are able to switch from twice-daily fluticasone propionate/salmeterol, FP/SAL (Seretide Accuhaler) 250/50 to once-daily FF/VI 100/25, without compromising their lung function. Based on review of the data from this study (201378), no new safety signals were identified and the adverse event data are consistent with the known safety profile for FF/VI established in patients with asthma. The study design was agreed with European regulatory authorities. Study Design: Following a 4-week open-label treatment period with FP/SAL 250/50 twice-daily, patients with well-controlled asthma were randomised to receive either FF/VI 100/25 once-daily, FP/SAL 250/50 twice-daily or FP 250 twice-daily in a double-blind, double-dummy manner for 24 weeks at multiple centres in 12 countries. The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of Relvar Ellipta 100/25 once-daily with Seretide Accuhaler 250/50 twice-daily in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older with persistent bronchial asthma, well-controlled on twice-daily ICS/LABA. The endpoint for the study was the change from baseline in clinic visit evening FEV1 (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) at the end of the 24-week treatment period.

Here's Why Innoviva Inc. Lost 10% Today
Innoviva's proxy battle with an activist hedge fund for board seats leaves shareholders disappointed. 











                Sean Williams
            

                (TMFUltraLong)



            
            Apr 20, 2017 at 6:08PM
            
            





What happened
Shares of Innoviva (NASDAQ:INVA), a biotechnology royalty company that develops respiratory therapeutics and is perhaps best known as GlaxoSmithKline's (NYSE:GSK) development partner for its multiple next-generation COPD and asthma products, fell as much as 11% on Thursday. The reason behind Innoviva's bad day can be traced to a proxy battle with activist hedge fund Sarissa Capital Management over seats on its board.
So what 
According to a press release from Sarissa Capital on Wednesday evening (since Innoviva has thus far declined to comment), Innoviva had agreed to settle its proxy fight by allowing Sarissa two board seats. However, according to reports, Innoviva continued to lobby for votes from shareholders without disclosing the fact that a deal had been reached with Sarissa Capital. Sarissa sent over the signed paperwork to Innoviva on Wednesday afternoon agreeing to the settlement but was told by Innoviva that it would renege on its offer to place two of Sarissa's choices on its board. When the smoke cleared, Innoviva had narrowly garnered enough votes to keep its own members on the board.

Sarissa Capital Management, which owns 2.72% of Innoviva's outstanding shares, has been critical of the company's executive compensation. As GlaxoSmithKline's partner for Breo Ellipta, Anoro Ellipta, Incruse, and Arnuity, Innoviva has the sole task of managing the royalties it receives from Glaxo. Sarissa alleges that high executive-compensation levels are reducing its profitability and hampering returns for shareholders. Thus, Sarissa's failure to get any board seats is being construed as bad news for shareholders that any meaningful cost-cutting will happen in the near future.
For what it's worth, GlaxoSmithKline, which has a 29.3% stake in Innoviva, opposed Sarissa's attempts to get their members on Innoviva's board.





Now what
While today's made-for-TV drama caused Innoviva's stock to tumble 10%, and shareholders are clearly not pleased with having an activist investor lose out on board seats, this probably isn't a long-term issue for the company. Innoviva has pledged to take a closer look at its executive compensation, and with the matter now in the public light, it's unlikely that it'll be swept under the rug.
What's far more important for Innoviva shareholders at this point is the continued growth of it and Glaxo's respiratory products. Though these next-generation products offer new, long-lasting solutions to patients, infiltrating the market is taking more time than expected. Physicians and consumers have been using mature and effective therapies for years, and educating them that new choices are available is a tedious process. It also has taken time for GlaxoSmithKline to gain adequate insurer coverage on its new therapies.
Patient investors will probably be well rewarded, with Wall Street projecting $2.33 in full-year EPS by 2019, but we'll also need to see Innoviva making a serious effort to cut costs and pay down its existing debt.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, our operating expenses, and future payments under our collaboration agreements, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and  Management Overview  Innoviva, Inc. is focused on bringing compelling new medicines to patients in areas of unmet need by leveraging its significant expertise in the development, commercialization and financial management of bio-pharmaceuticals, to maximize the commercial potential of its respiratory assets partnered with Glaxo Group Limited ("GSK"), including RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) (fluticasone furoate/ vilanterol, "FF/VI") and ANORO(R) ELLIPTA(R) (umeclidinium bromide/ vilanterol, "UMEC/VI"). Under the Long-Acting Beta2 Agonist ("LABA") Collaboration Agreement and the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK (referred to herein collectively as the "GSK Agreements"), we are entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion. For other products combined with a LABA from the LABA collaboration, such as ANORO(TM) ELLIPTA(TM), royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%. Innoviva is also entitled to 15% of any future payments made by GSK under its agreements originally entered into with us, and since assigned to Theravance Respiratory Company, LLC ("TRC"). In June 2014, we spun-off our research and development activities by distributing the outstanding shares of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ("Theravance Biopharma") on a pro-rata basis to our stockholders (the "Spin-Off"), which resulted in Theravance Biopharma becoming an independent, publicly traded company.  We have designed our company structure and organization to be tailored to our focused activities of managing our respiratory assets with GSK, the commercial and developmental obligations associated with the GSK Agreements, intellectual property, licensing operations, business development activities and providing for certain essential reporting and management functions of a public company. As of December 31, 2016, we had 14 employees. Our revenues consist of royalties and potential milestone payments, if any, from our respiratory partnership agreements with GSK.  Table of Contents  Financial Highlights  In the year ended December 31, 2016, our net income from operations was $59.5 million, an improvement of $78.3 million from a net loss from continuing operations of $18.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in net royalty revenue. Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, totaled $150.4 million on December 31, 2016, a decrease of $36.9 million from December 31, 2015. The decrease was due primarily to the repurchases of common stock of $78.1 million, repurchases of our 2023 Notes of $11.6 million, payments on principal of our 2029 Notes of $6.8 million and net purchases of marketable securities of $4.3 million. These outflows were partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $61.0 million.  Capital Return Plans  In October 2015, we announced the acceleration of our capital return plan with an up to $150 million share repurchase program effective through the end of 2016, the 2016 Share Repurchase Program. In February 2017, we announced a new capital return plan, the 2017 Capital Return Plan. The 2017 Capital Return Plan authorizes a combination of repurchases of stock and/or repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of debt up to $150 million, through tender offers, open market purchases, private transactions, exchange offers or other means through December 31, 2017. The 2017 Capital Return Plan is expected to be funded using our working capital. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount of debt or equity or number of shares of common stock under the 2017 Capital Return Plan. We will determine when, if and how to proceed with any repurchase transactions under the program, as well as the amount of any such repurchase transactions, based upon, among other things, our evaluation of our liquidity and capital needs (including for strategic and other opportunities), our business, results of operations, and financial position and prospects, general financial, economic and market conditions, prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock, corporate, regulatory and legal requirements, and other conditions and factors deemed relevant by our management and Board of Directors from time to time. Our 2017 Capital Return Plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. There can be no assurance as to the actual volume of any debt or share repurchases in any given period or over the term of the program or as to the manner or terms of any such transactions.  From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we purchased 7,201,448 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $10.84 per share for a total value of approximately $78.1 million in the open market pursuant to the 2016 Share Repurchase Program. Overall, under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program, we purchased 9,877,684 shares of our common stock at an average purchase price of $10.50 per share for a total value of approximately $103.7 million.  Repurchases of Notes Payable  During the year ending December 31, 2016, we retired a portion of our 2023 Notes with a face value of $14.1 million and carrying value of $13.9 million by way of open market purchases. The 2023 Notes were purchased for a total settlement price of $11.6 million resulting in a gain of $2.3 million. As a result of the partial retirement of our 2023 Notes, we entered into partial termination agreements of our capped call option transaction and received $0.6 million from the counterparty.  Collaborative Arrangements with GSK  LABA Collaboration  In November 2002, we entered into our LABA Collaboration Agreement with GSK to develop and commercialize once-daily LABA products for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") and asthma. The collaboration has developed two combination products: (1) RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) (FF/VI) (BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) is the proprietary name in the U.S. and Canada and RELVAR(R) ELLIPTA(R) is the proprietary name outside the U.S. and Canada), a once-daily combination medicine consisting of a LABA, vilanterol (VI), and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), fluticasone furoate (FF) and (2) ANORO(R) ELLIPTA(R) (UMEC/VI), a once-daily medicine combining a long-acting muscarinic antagonist ("LAMA"), umeclidinium bromide (UMEC), with a LABA, VI.  Table of Contents  As a result of the launch and approval of RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) and ANORO(R) ELLIPTA(R) in the U.S., Japan and Europe, we paid milestone fees to GSK totaling $220.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Although we have no further milestone payment obligations to GSK pursuant to the LABA Collaboration Agreement, we continue to have ongoing participation as part of the collaboration, including joint steering and joint project committees that are expected to continue over the life of the agreement. The milestone fees paid to GSK were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives commencing upon the commercial launch of the products.  We are entitled to receive royalties from GSK on sales of RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) as follows: 15% on the first $3.0 billion of annual global net sales and 5% for all annual global net sales above $3.0 billion. For other products combined with a LABA from the LABA collaboration, such as ANORO(TM) ELLIPTA(TM), royalties are upward tiering and range from 6.5% to 10%.  2004 Strategic Alliance  In March 2004, we entered into the Strategic Alliance Agreement with GSK where GSK received an option to license exclusive development and commercialization rights to product candidates from certain of our discovery programs on pre-determined terms and on an exclusive, worldwide basis. In 2005, GSK licensed our MABA program for the treatment of COPD, and in October 2011, we and GSK expanded the MABA program by adding six additional Innoviva-discovered preclinical MABA compounds (the "Additional MABAs"). GSK is responsible for funding all future development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for product candidates in that program. As a result of the Spin-Off, we are only entitled to receive 15% of any contingent payments and royalties payable by GSK from sales of FF/UMEC/VI (and MABA, and MABA/FF) while Theravance Biopharma receives 85% of those same payments. See PART I, ITEM 1. BUSINESS - Our Relationship with GSK - 2004 Strategic Alliance, for more detail regarding the royalties payable by GSK under this agreement, if any.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenue generated and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.  Revenue Recognition  Revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Where the revenue recognition criteria are not met, we defer the recognition of revenue by recording deferred revenue until such time that all criteria are met.  Collaborative Arrangements and Multiple Element Arrangements  We generate revenue from collaboration and license agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates. Under the GSK agreements, revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees and development contingent payments were recognized ratably over the expected term of our performance of research and development services under the agreements. These upfront or contingent payments received, pending recognition as revenue, were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated performance periods. We recognize royalty revenue on licensee net sales of products with respect to which we  Table of Contents  have royalty rights in the period in which the royalties are earned and reported to us and collectability is reasonably assured. Royalty revenue earned is reduced by amortization expense resulting from the fees paid to GSK, which were recognized as capitalized fees paid to a related party.  Under the GSK Agreements, we recognized net revenue of $133.6 million, $53.9 million and $8.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The remaining deferred revenue under the GSK Strategic Alliance Agreement is $3.1 million as of December 31, 2016. Any change in the estimated performance period, which is predominantly based on GSK's development timeline, will not have a significant impact on the results of operations, except for a change in estimated performance period resulting from the termination of the MABA program that would result in immediate recognition of the deferred revenue.  Capitalized Fees paid to a Related Party  We capitalize fees paid to licensors related to agreements for approved products or commercialized products ("Capitalized Fees"). Our gross Capitalized Fees of $220.0 million as of December 31, 2016 consist of registrational and launch-related to milestone fees paid to GSK. We capitalized these fees as capitalized fees paid to a related party and amortize these Capitalized Fees on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives upon the commercial launch of the products. The estimated useful lives of these Capitalized Fees are based on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, as the later of the expiration or termination of the last patent right covering the compound in such product in such country and 15 years from first commercial sale of such product in such country, unless the agreement is terminated earlier. Consistent with our policy for classification of costs under the research and development collaborative arrangements, the amortization of these Capitalized Fees is recognized as a reduction of royalty revenue. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $13.8 million, $13.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively. The remaining estimated amortization expense is $13.8 million for each of the years from 2017 to 2021 and $111.4 million thereafter.  We review our Capitalized Fees for impairment on a product-by-product basis for each major geographic area when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The recoverability of Capitalized Fees is measured by comparing the asset's carrying amount to the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. The determination of recoverability typically requires various estimates and assumptions, including estimating the useful life over which cash flows will occur, their amount, and the asset's residual value, if any. We derive the required cash flow estimates from near-term forecasted product sales and long-term projected sales in the corresponding market. Based upon our analyses, no impairment charges have been recorded on the Capitalized Fees as of December 31, 2016.  Fair Value of Stock-Based Compensation Awards  We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options as of the date of grant. The Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the award and the expected stock price volatility. We use the "simplified" method as described in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, "Share Based Payment," for the expected option term. We use our historical volatility to estimate expected stock price volatility. The estimated fair value of the option is expensed on a ratable basis over the expected term of the grant.  We determine the fair value of RSUs and RSAs based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. The fair value of service based RSUs and RSAs is expensed on a ratable or straight-line basis over the expected term of the vesting. The fair value of performance-contingent RSUs and RSAs is expensed using an accelerated method over the requisite service period based on management's best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest. We assess the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis. The grant date fair value of the RSUs and RSAs with a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model and the compensation expense is recognized over the implied service period.  Stock-based compensation expense was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and was reduced for estimated forfeitures as of the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. The estimated annual forfeiture rates for stock options, RSUs and RSAs are based on our historical forfeiture experience.  Table of Contents  For more information, refer to Note 6, "Stock-Based Compensation," to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs from Non-recourse Notes Payable, due 2029  In April 2014, we entered into certain note purchase agreements relating to the private placement of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of non-recourse 9% fixed rate term notes due 2029 (the "2029 Notes") issued by our wholly-owned subsidiary. The 2029 Notes are secured exclusively by a security interest in a segregated bank account established to receive 40% of royalties due to us under the LABA Collaboration with GSK commencing on April 1, 2014 and ending upon the earlier of full repayment of principal or May 15, 2029. The funds in the segregated bank account can only be used to make principal and interest payments on the 2029 Notes.  The 2029 Notes bear an annual interest rate of 9%, with interest and principal paid quarterly beginning November 15, 2014. The 2029 Notes may be redeemed at any time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, at specified redemption premiums. Prior to May 15, 2016, in the event that the specified portion of royalties received in a quarter was less than the interest accrued for the quarter, the principal amount of the 2029 Notes was increased by the interest shortfall amount for that period.  In connection with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, we incurred approximately $15.3 million in transaction costs, which are amortized to interest expense over the estimated life of the 2029 Notes based on the effective interest method. Since the principal and interest payments on the 2029 Notes are based on royalties from product sales, which vary from quarter to quarter, the 2029 Notes may be repaid prior to the final maturity date in 2029. To the extent that the interest or principal payments are greater or less than our initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than our original estimates, we will prospectively adjust the amortization of the debt issuance costs. There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of the royalty payments due to us under the LABA Collaboration with GSK, most of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the competitive landscape for approved products and developing therapies that compete with our partnered products, the ability of patients to be able to afford our partnered products, the size of the market for our partnered products, safety concerns in the marketplace for respiratory therapies in general and with our partnered products in particular, decisions as to the timing of product launches, pricing and discounts, and other events or circumstances that result in reduced royalty payments, all of which would result in an impact to the amount of debt issuance costs amortized.  Results of Operations  Net Revenue Total net revenue from continuing operations, as compared to the prior years, was as follows: Change Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Royalties from a related party - RELVAR/BREO $ 128,638 $ 59,188 $ 16,635 $ 69,450 117 % $ 42,553 * % Royalties from a related party - ANORO 17,869 7,699 1,782 10,170 132 5,917 * Total royalties from a related party 146,507 66,887 18,417 79,620 119 48,470 * Less: amortization of capitalized fees paid to a related party (13,823 ) (13,823 ) (11,066 ) - - (2,757 ) (25 ) Royalty revenue 132,684 53,064 7,351 79,620 150 45,713 * Strategic alliance - MABA program license 885 885 1,082 - - (197 ) (18 ) Total net revenue from GSK $ 133,569 $ 53,949 $ 8,433 $ 79,620 148 % $ 45,516 * %   *  Table of Contents  Total net revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increases were primarily due to growth in prescriptions and market share for both RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) and ANORO(R) ELLIPTA(R). The revenue growth during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 may not be indicative of our future revenue growth, if any.  Total net revenue increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increases were primarily due to higher sales of RELVAR(R)/BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R), ANORO(R) ELLIPTA(R) not having been commercially launched until April 2014 and the approval in April 2015 of BREO(R) ELLIPTA(R) (FF/VI) as a once-daily inhaled treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older in the U.S.  Research & Development  Research & Development ("R&D") expenses from continuing operations, as compared to the prior years, were as follows:  Change Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Research and development  R&D expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to reduced activities related to the late-stage partnered respiratory assets with GSK.  R&D expenses from continuing operations decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to fewer costs incurred and due to higher stock-based compensation in the year ended December 31, 2014. Stock-based compensation expense was higher during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to the achievement of performance conditions under a specified long-term retention and incentive equity awarded to certain employees in the year ended December 31, 2011.  General & Administrative  General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, as compared to the prior years, were as follows:  Change Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % General and administrative  General and administrative expenses increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expenses related to pre-Spin-Off legacy performance-contingent RSAs and higher employee costs.  General and administrative expenses from continuing operations decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense and reduced overhead costs, mostly related to the reduced size of our operations following the Spin-Off in 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, stock-based compensation expense and employee-related costs were higher primarily due to the probable achievement of performance conditions under a special long-term retention and incentive equity and cash bonus awarded to certain employees in the year ended December 31, 2011.  Table of Contents  Other Income (Expense), net and Interest Income  Other income (expense), net and interest income, as compared to the prior years, were as follows:  Change Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Other income (expense), net $ 2,382 $ 1,120 $ (3,272) $ 1,262 113% $ 4,392 (134)% Interest income 582 343 563 $ 239 70% $ (220) (39)  Other income (expense), net increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to realized gain of $2.3 million from the repurchases of our 2023 Notes during the year ended December 31, 2016.  Interest income increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher interest generated from our investments in marketable securities.  Other income (expense), net increased in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily related to a realized gain of $1.2 million on the sale of all of the ordinary shares of Theravance Biopharma that we held as of December 31, 2014 in the first quarter of 2015.  Interest income decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the full year effect of lower average cash balances resulting from the cash contribution to Theravance Biopharma in June 2014 and capital return programs in 2015.  Other income (expense), net in the year ended December 31, 2014 includes a charge of $3.8 million recognized for the unrealized loss as of December 31, 2014 on Theravance Biopharma, Inc. ordinary shares owned by us.  Interest Expense  Interest expense, as compared to the prior years, was as follows:  Change Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 (In thousands) 2016 2015 2014 $ % $ % Interest expense $ 52,416 $ 51,803 $ 36,892 $ 613 1% $ 14,911 40%  Interest expense increased in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to higher outstanding average principal balance on our 2029 Notes, of which $0.9 million was added in the first two quarters of 2016 and $43.2 million was added during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in the form of payment in kind ("PIK").

	Positive results for Relvar



	®


	 Ellipta


	®


	lung function study in patients with well-controlled asthma




	 




	LONDON & BRISBANE, Calif. (BUSINESS WIRE) GlaxoSmithKline plc (LSE/NYSE:GSK) and Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) today announced positive headline results from a non-inferiority lung function study, which demonstrated that patients with well-controlled asthma were able to switch to the once-daily Relvar


	®

	 Ellipta

	®

	 (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, FF/VI) 100/25, an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta

	2

	 agonist (LABA) combination, from the twice-daily Seretide

	®

	 Accuhaler

	®

	 (fluticasone propionate /salmeterol, FP/SAL) 250/50, without compromising their lung function.



	 




	Patients randomised to FF/VI taken once-daily maintained a lung function comparable with those randomised to the twice-daily FP/SAL.

	[difference +19mL (95% CI: -11mL, +49mL], meeting the studys primary end point, based on lower bound (-11mL) of the 95% confidence interval falling above the non-inferiority margin of -100mL.



	 




	A third treatment arm with fluticasone propionate (FP), ICS monotherapy, was included to detect a lung function difference between treatments. Results demonstrated statistically significant differences in favour of the ICS/LABA combinations to FP (p<0.001).




	 




	The incidences of on-treatment serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) of special interest were consistent with the known safety profile of FF/VI, established in asthma patients from other studies.




	 




	Eric Dube, SVP and Global Head of Respiratory Franchise, GSK said: At GSK we are constantly searching for ways in which we can help patients better manage their asthma. In this positive study we have demonstrated non-inferiority for once-daily Relvar versus twice-daily Seretide on lung function. This gives us confidence that for patients who struggle taking a twice-daily treatment regimen, there may be a once-daily treatment option available, providing greater physician choice to help patients.




	 




	Mike Aguiar, CEO of Innoviva, Inc., added: We believe the results of this study are important for patients and physicians. They provide additional evidence that patients with persistent asthma, who are currently treated with a twice-daily ICS/LABA, in this case Seretide, can experience a similar level of benefit in lung function when treated with Relvar Ellipta, which only needs to be taken once a day.




	 




	The study design was agreed with European regulatory authorities. GSK now intends to submit this data to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).




	 




	Results from the study will be shared in future publications and presentations.




	 





	Study Design





	 




	Following a 4-week open-label treatment period with FP/SAL 250/50 twice-daily, patients with well controlled asthma were randomised to receive either FF/VI 100/25 once-daily, FP/SAL 250/50 twice-daily or FP 250 twice-daily in a double-blind, double-dummy manner for 24 weeks at multiple centres in 12 countries.




	 




	The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of Relvar Ellipta 100/25 once-daily with Seretide Accuhaler 250/50 twice-daily in adult and adolescent subjects 12 years of age and older

	with persistent bronchial asthma, well controlled on twice-daily ICS/LABA. The endpoint for the study was the change from baseline in clinic visit evening FEV


	1

	(pre-brochodilator and pre-dose) at the end of the 24-week treatment period.



	 




	To demonstrate the non inferiority of FF/VI vs FP/SAL the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in change from baseline for evening FEV


	1

	 needed to be greater than the pre defined margin of -100mL. This was to rule out the possibility that FF/VI was more than -100mL inferior to FP/SAL.



	 





	About asthma





	 




	Asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways.

	  Asthma affects 358 million people worldwide. Despite medical advances, more than half of patients continue to experience poor control and significant symptoms impacting their daily life.



	 




	The causes of asthma are not completely understood but likely involve an interaction between a persons genetic make-up and the environment. Key risk factors are inhaled substances that provoke allergic reactions or irritate the airways.




	 





	About Relvar Ellipta (fluticasone furoate + vilanterol)





	 




	Relvar Ellipta is a once-daily dual combination treatment comprising fluticasone furoate, an inhaled corticosteroid and vilanterol, a long-acting beta


	2

	-agonist, in a single inhaler, the Ellipta

	®

	.



	 




	Relvar Ellipta is indicated in Europe in the regular treatment of patients aged 12 and over with asthma, where use of a combination product (long-acting ß2agonist, LABA, and inhaled corticosteroid, ICS) is appropriate: Patients not adequately controlled on both ICS and as-needed short-acting

	ß

	2

	-agonist (SABA).



	 




	Full EU prescribing information is available at:  EU Prescribing Information for Relvar Ellipta.




	 





	Important safety information for Relvar Ellipta in Europe





	 




	FF/VI 

	is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to either fluticasone furoate, vilanterol, or any of the excipients.



	 




	FF/VI should not be used to treat acute asthma symptoms or an acute exacerbation in COPD, for which a short-acting bronchodilator is required. Increasing use of short-acting bronchodilators to relieve symptoms indicates deterioration of control and patients should be reviewed by a physician.




	 




	Patients should not stop therapy with FF/VI in asthma or COPD, without physician supervision since symptoms may recur after discontinuation.




	 




	Asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with FF/VI. Patients should be asked to continue treatment but to seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen after initiation of treatment with FF/VI.




	 




	Paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. This should be treated immediately with a short-acting inhaled bronchodilator. FF/VI should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed and alternative therapy instituted if necessary.




	 




	Cardiovascular effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias e.g. supraventricular tachycardia and extrasystoles may be seen with sympathomimetic medicinal products including FF/VI. Therefore fluticasone furoate/vilanterol should be used with caution in patients with severe cardiovascular disease.




	 




	For patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment, the 92/22 mcg dose should be used and patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions. FF/VI 184/22 mcg is not indicated for patients with COPD. There is no additional benefit of the 184/22 mcg dose compared to the 92/22 mcg dose and there is a potential increased risk of pneumonia and systemic corticosteroid-related adverse reactions.

	An increase in the incidence of pneumonia has been observed in subjects with COPD receiving 

	FF/VI. There was also an increased incidence of pneumonias resulting in hospitalisation. In some instances these pneumonia events were fatal.



	 




	The incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma was common at the higher dose. In a previous study of FF/VI in asthma, the incidence of pneumonia in patients with asthma taking FF/VI 184/22 mcg was numerically higher compared with those receiving FF/VI 92/22 mcg or placebo.




	 




	Hyperglycaemia: There have been reports of increases in blood glucose levels in diabetic patients and this should be considered when prescribing to patients with a history of diabetes mellitus.




	 




	Systemic effects may occur with any inhaled corticosteroid, particularly at high doses prescribed for long periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids. Possible systemic effects include 

	Cushings syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, decrease in bone mineral density, growth retardation in children and adolescents, cataract and glaucoma and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children).



	 




	FF/VI should be administered with caution in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis or in patients with chronic or untreated infections. Data from large asthma and COPD clinical trials were used to determine the frequency of adverse reactions associated with FF/VI.




	 




	Very common adverse reactions (occurring in >1/10 patients) with FF/VI were headache and nasopharyngitis. Common adverse reactions (occurring in >1/100 to <1/10 patients) were pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infection, bronchitis, influenza, candidiasis of mouth and throat, oropharyngeal pain, sinusitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, cough, dysphonia, abdominal pain, arthralgia, back pain, fractures, and pyrexia and muscle spasms..Extrasystoles were observed as an uncommon adverse reaction (occurring in >1/1,000 to <1/100 patients). Rare adverse reactions (occurring in >1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) were hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash and urticaria), anxiety, tremor, palpitations, tachycardia and paradoxical bronchospasm. With the exception of pneumonia and fractures, the safety profile was similar in patients with asthma and COPD. During clinical studies, pneumonia and fractures were more frequently observed in patients with COPD.

	The once-daily treatment of asthma in patients aged 18 years and older.



	 




	Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABA)

	, such as vilanterol, one of the active ingredients in Breo Ellipta, increase the risk of asthma-related death. Available data from controlled clinical trials suggest that LABA increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. Therefore, when treating patients with asthma, physicians should only prescribe Breo Ellipta for patients not adequately controlled on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid, or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a LABA. Once asthma control is achieved and maintained, assess the patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue Breo Ellipta) if possible without loss of asthma control and maintain the patient on a long-term asthma control medication, such as an inhaled corticosteroid. Do not use BREO ELLIPTA for patients whose asthma is adequately controlled on low- or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids.

	Important safety information for Seretide Accuhaler





	 





	Uses:


	Asthma: Regular treatment of asthma, where a long-acting β

	2

	 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid is appropriate, i.e. patients uncontrolled on inhaled corticosteroids and as needed short-acting inhaled bronchodilator or patients controlled on inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β

	2

	 agonist. Lowest strength Seretide (salmeterol 25mcg/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg  and salmeterol 50mcg/fluticasone propionate 100 mcg) not appropriate in severe asthma. COPD: Symptomatic treatment of patients with COPD with a FEV1 <60% predicted normal (pre-bronchodilator) and a history of repeated exacerbations, who have significant symptoms despite regular bronchodilator therapy.



	 





	Dosage and administration:


	Inhalation only. Asthma:

	Adults and adolescents 12 years and over

	: Seretide Accuhaler - one inhalation b.d. of: Seretide 100 (salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone propionate 100 mcg) or Seretide 250 (salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone propionate 250 mcg) or Seretide 500 (salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone propionate 500 mcg), Seretide Evohaler  two puffs b.d. of: Seretide 50 (salmeterol 25 mcg/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg) or Seretide 125 (salmeterol 25 mcg/fluticasone propionate 125mcg) or Seretide 250 (salmeterol 25 mcg/fluticasone propionate 250 mcg).

	Children 4-11 years

	: Seretide 50 Evohaler (salmeterol 25 mcg/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg): two puffs b.d. Spacer recommended for co-ordination. Seretide 100 Accuhaler (salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone propionate 100 mcg) one inhalation b.d. Regularly review patients and reduce dose to lowest that maintains effective symptom control. Where the control of symptoms is maintained with the lowest strength of the combination, patients may be prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid alone, or if a long-acting β

	2

	 agonist is required, Seretide may be given once daily. If rapid control of asthma in adults or adolescents with moderate persistent asthma (defined as patients with daily symptoms, daily rescue use and moderate to severe airflow limitation) is essential, an initial dose of two inhalations b.d of Seretide 50 Evohaler (salmeterol 25 mcg/fluticasone propionate 50 mcg) or one inhalation b.d of Seretide 100 Accuhaler (salmeterol 50 mcg/fluticasone propionate 100 mcg) may be considered on a short-term basis. Once control of asthma is attained treatment should be regularly reviewed and stepped down. Doubling the dose of all strengths of Seretide may be considered when adult patients require additional short-term (up to 14 days) inhaled corticosteroid therapy but this causes a small increase in β-agonist-related adverse events. COPD: one inhalation b.d. of Seretide 500 Accuhaler (salmeterol 50mcg/fluticasone propionate 500 mcg).



	 





	Contraindications:


	Hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or to any of the excipients.



	 





	Precautions:


	Pulmonary tuberculosis, fungal, viral or other infections of the airway, severe cardiovascular disorders, heart rhythm abnormalities, diabetes mellitus, hypokalaemia and thyrotoxicosis. Increased reporting of pneumonia and bronchitis in patients with COPD receiving Seretide compared with placebo. If a patient with severe COPD has experienced pneumonia, treatment with Seretide should be re-evaluated. Paradoxical bronchospasm post dose.

	Severe unstable asthma

	: Warn patients to seek medical advice if short-acting inhaled bronchodilator use increases. Consider increased inhaled/additional corticosteroid therapy.

	Acute symptoms

	: Not for acute symptoms. Use short-acting inhaled bronchodilator.

	Systemic effects

	: Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses for prolonged periods, but much less likely than with oral corticosteroids. May include Cushings syndrome, cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, adrenal crisis, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataract, glaucoma and, more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). Monitor height of children on prolonged inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Tremor, palpitations and headache, have been reported with β

	supervision to lowest effective dose and treatment should not be abruptly stopped due to risk of exacerbation. Serious asthma-related adverse events and exacerbations may occur during treatment with Seretide. Patients should not be initiated on Seretide during an exacerbation, or if they have significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma. Data from a large asthma trial suggested patients of black African or Afro-Caribbean ancestry were at increased risk of serious respiratory-related events or deaths when using salmeterol. All patients should continue treatment but seek medical advice if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled or worsen when initiated on Seretide or using Seretide. In COPD cessation of therapy may also be associated with decompensation and should be supervised by a physician.

	Transfer from oral steroids

	: Special care needed. Consider appropriate steroid therapy in stressful situations.




	 





	Drug interactions:


	Avoid beta-blockers. Avoid concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin, ritonavir) and moderate (erythromycin) CYP3A4 inhibitors unless benefits outweigh potential risk. β

	2

	 adrenergic blockers may weaken or antagonise the effect of salmeterol. Potentially serious hypokalaemia may result from

	b


	2

	 agonist therapy.  Particular caution is advised in acute severe asthma as this effect may be potentiated by concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids and diuretics.



	 





	Pregnancy and lactation:


	Experience limited. Balance risks against benefits.



	 





	Side effects:



	Very Common:

	headache, nasopharyngitis

	. Common:

	candidiasis of the mouth and throat, hoarseness/dysphonia, throat irritation, pneumonia, bronchitis, hypokalaemia, sinusitis, contusions, traumatic fractures, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle cramps

	.


	Uncommon:

	respiratory symptoms (dyspnoea), anxiety, tremor, palpitations, tachycardia, angina pectoris, atrial fibrillation, cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycaemia, sleep disorders, cataract

	.


	Rare:

	angioedema, respiratory symptoms (bronchospasm), anaphylactic reactions including anaphylactic shock, Cushings syndrome, cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decreased bone mineral density, oesophageal candidiasis, behavioural changes including psychomotor hyperactivity and irritability (predominately in children), glaucoma, cardiac arrhythmias and paradoxical bronchospasm.

	Not known:

	depression or aggression (particularly in children).

	Paradoxical bronchospasm

	: substitute alternative therapy.
