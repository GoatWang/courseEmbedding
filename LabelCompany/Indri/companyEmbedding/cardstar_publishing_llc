What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Execution Version

SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 TO AMENDED AND
RESTATED COLLATERAL AGREEMENT

SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 dated as of
February 9, 2016 (this “ Supplement ”), to
the Amended and Restated Collateral Agreement dated as of
November 25, 2013 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “ Collateral Agreement
”), among ENDURANCE INTERNATIONAL GROUP HOLDINGS INC., a
Delaware corporation (“ Holdings ”), EIG
INVESTORS CORP., a Delaware corporation (the “
Borrower ”), the other GRANTORS from time to time
party thereto and CREDIT SUISSE AG, CAYMAN ISLANDS BRANCH, as
Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the “
Administrative Agent ”).

A. Reference is made to (a) the
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated of even date with
the Collateral Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, the “ Credit Agreement
”), among Holdings, the Borrower, the Lenders from time to
time party thereto and the Administrative Agent, and (b) the
Collateral Agreement.

B. Capitalized terms used herein and
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to
such terms in the Collateral Agreement.

C. The initial Grantors entered into
the Collateral Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make
Loans and the Issuing Banks to issue Letters of Credit.
Section 5.14 of the Collateral Agreement provides that
additional Persons may become Grantors under the Collateral
Agreement by execution and delivery of an instrument in the form of
this Supplement. The undersigned (the “ New Grantors
”) are executing this Supplement in accordance with the
requirements of the Credit Agreement to become Grantors under the
Collateral Agreement in order to induce the Lenders to make
additional Loans and the Issuing Banks to issue additional Letters
of Credit and as consideration for Loans previously made and
Letters of Credit previously issued.

Accordingly, the Administrative
Agent and the New Grantors agree as follows:

SECTION 1. In accordance with
Section 5.14 of the Collateral Agreement, the New Grantors by
their signatures below become Grantors under the Collateral
Agreement with the same force and effect as if originally named
therein as Grantors, and each New Grantor hereby (a) agrees to
all the terms and provisions of the Collateral Agreement applicable
to it as a Grantor thereunder and (b) represents and warrants
that the representations and warranties made by it as a Grantor
thereunder are true and correct on and as of the date hereof. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each New Grantor, as security for the
payment and performance in full of the Secured Obligations, does
hereby create and grant to the Administrative Agent, its successors
and assigns, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, a security
interest in and lien on all of such New Grantor’s right,
title and interest in, to and under the Pledged Collateral and the
Article 9 Collateral. Each reference to the “Grantors”
in the Collateral Agreement shall be deemed to include the New
Grantors. The Collateral Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by
reference.

SECTION 2. Each of the New Grantors
represent and warrant to the Administrative Agent and the other
Secured Parties that this Supplement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by such New Grantor and constitutes such New
Grantor’s legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against such New Grantor in accordance with its terms, except to
the extent that enforceability of such obligations may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally.

SECTION 3. This Supplement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original
but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single
contract. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Supplement
by facsimile


or other electronic transmission shall be
effective as delivery of a manually signed counterpart of this
Supplement. This Supplement shall become effective as to each New
Grantor when a counterpart hereof executed on behalf of such New
Grantor shall have been delivered to the Administrative Agent and a
counterpart hereof shall have been executed on behalf of the
Administrative Agent, and thereafter shall be binding upon such New
Grantor and the Administrative Agent and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of such New
Grantor, the Administrative Agent and the other Secured Parties and
their respective successors and assigns, except that such New
Grantor shall not have the right to assign or transfer its rights
or obligations hereunder or any interest herein (and any such
assignment or transfer shall be void) except as expressly provided
in this Supplement, the Collateral Agreement and the Credit
Agreement.

SECTION 4. Each New Grantor hereby
represents and warrants that (a) set forth on
Schedule I attached hereto is a schedule with the true
and correct legal name of such New Grantor, its jurisdiction of
organization and the location of its chief executive office,
(b)  Schedule II sets forth a true and complete list,
with respect to such New Grantor, of (i) all the Equity
Interests owned by such New Grantor in any subsidiary and the
percentage of the issued and outstanding units of each class of the
Equity Interests of the issuer thereof represented by the Pledged
Equity Interests owned by such New Grantor and (ii) all the
Pledged Debt Securities owned by such New Grantor and (c) 
Schedule III attached hereto sets forth, as of the date
hereof, (i) all of such New Grantor’s Patents, including
the name of the registered owner, type, registration or application
number and the expiration date (if already registered) of each such
Patent owned by such New Grantor, (ii) all of such New
Grantor’s Trademarks, including the name of the
registered owner, the registration or application number and the
expiration date (if already registered) of each such Trademark
owned by such New Grantor, and (iii) all of such New
Grantor’s Copyrights, including the name of the registered
owner, title and, if applicable, the registration number of each
such Copyright owned by such New Grantor, and (d)  Schedule
IV attached hereto sets forth, as of the date hereof, each
Commercial Tort Claim (in respect of which a complaint or
counterclaim has been prepared or filed by or on behalf of such New
Grantor) in an amount reasonably estimated to exceed
$1,000,000.

SECTION 5. Except as expressly
supplemented hereby, the Collateral Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.

SECTION 6. THIS SUPPLEMENT SHALL
BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK.

SECTION 7. Any provision of this
Supplement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the
extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular
provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such
provision in any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 8. All communications and
notices hereunder shall be in writing and given as provided in
Section 5.01 of the Collateral Agreement.

SECTION 9. The New Grantors agree to
reimburse the Administrative Agent for its fees and expenses
incurred hereunder and under the Collateral Agreement as provided
in Section 9.03(a) of the Credit Agreement; provided
that each reference therein to the “Borrower” shall be
deemed to be a reference to “the New
Grantors.”

Marketing & Sales




Q:

What are the advantages and disadvantages of sales promotions?



A:
Sales promotions may help businesses gain exposure, clear out old inventory and boost revenue, but they are not ideal for attracting new customers. Sales promotions are most valuable to small businesses and can help businesses develop key relationships with local consumers and business allies. However, sales promotions may only drive sales in short bursts, leaving companies with an effective short-term growth plan but no sound marketing solution for the long haul.

          by Karen Freeman

July 26, 2011



   DealStar (Free) by Cardstar Publishing, LLC is a new free app from the developers of CardStar, the app that supplants the need to carry all those little loyalty cards around with you. DealStar is different. This app lets you know about deals in your area.     It’s not a traditional coupon app, where you show your iPhone to a merchant to get a discount. Rather, it’s a collection of deal provider services, the best known being Groupon. I think most people are already familiar with Groupon. But, in case you aren’t, it’s a program that allows you to buy gift certificates at a discounted rate, usually about 50% off. Groupon has its own app, but if you’re interested in expanding to other, similar programs, and having them all accessible in one place, read on. DealStar includes the following deal providers: BuyWithMe, DealOn, Gilt City, Groupon, and Mobile Spinach. I live in a major metropolitan area with millions of residents. So, I figured there should be plenty of deals in my area. Well, I allowed the app to use my location, and then tried each of the deal providers in turn. Only Groupon actually had any deals in my area. Mobile Spinach had two deals that were each about an hour away. The others showed me deals in cities that were at least 5-6 hours away by car.  I tapped on one of the Groupon deals. Instead of letting me buy the certificate directly in the app, it took me to Groupon’s website. Not the most efficient, considering I’m on my iPhone. For me, it would really make more sense just to get the Groupon app, since Groupon is the only deal provider truly in my area, and the dedicated app just works better. But for you, it will really just depend where you live. I personally do not like the kinds of “coupons” that you have to buy ahead of time. I’ve bought a few, but I feel like these companies must make some portion of their profit from people who buy these and then forget to redeem them in time. Because yes, these “coupons” do expire, even though you have paid for them. That said, I know a lot of people buy and use these “coupons” all the time, and I’m sure they save a lot of money this way. The bottom line is: if you live in a major American city and love this particular sort of coupon, you’ll probably find this to be a worthwhile app.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
