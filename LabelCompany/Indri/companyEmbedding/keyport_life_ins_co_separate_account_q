No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)


To get started, fill out the form above and a local, professionally-trained agent will get back to you with a no-cost, no-obligation consultation.

In Oregon, the policy form numbers are as follows: Family Protection - 206-110.27; Level Premium Convertible Term - 210-60.27; One-Year Non Renewable Term - 209-125.27; and Yearly Convertible Term - 210-135-27.

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?

	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?
                            

As one of the oldest and largest mutual life insurance companies in the United States, New York Life has been protecting generations of families for more than 170 years. New York Life has the highest possible ratings for financial strength currently awarded to any life insurer from the leading independent rating services: A.M. Best (A++) Highest Rating, Fitch (AAA)Highest Rating, Standard & Poor’s (AA+) Second-Highest Rating, Moody’s Investors Service(Aaa) Highest Rating. Ratings as of 5/01/17.




	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

One Day PaySM †
With Aflac, qualified claims are paid in just a day.







Here's how it works.2
Medical expenses don’t always come from an accident or critical illness; sometimes it starts with a visit to an urgent care clinic because of a sharp pain in your side. While health insurance typically covers some of the expense, you will likely be responsible for a portion of the bill. Aflac Choice helps with those unexpected hospital expenses that may not be covered by health insurance. That way, you may not have to sacrifice your vacation budget for those unexpected medical costs.







Trouble strikes.






You suddenly experience a sharp pain in your side and go to an urgent care clinic, where you’re diagnosed with appendicitis.





You find yourself in the emergency room.






You’re taken by ambulance to the emergency room, where lab tests and diagnostic exams report back that you need surgery right away.





Aflac helps take the sting out.






After a 3-day stay in the hospital you’re feeling much better, but hospital bills add up quickly. Cash benefits are paid directly to you (unless otherwise assigned), which can help ease the financial stress of your illness.





You get your money fast.






Claims made on your Aflac Choice policy are eligible for One Day Pay℠.† Now that's fast.

Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company: No-Action letter dated December 19, 2003














Home | Previous Page





























 
Securities Act of 1933 - Section 5 and Rule 145
Investment Company Act of 1940 - Section 8 and 11
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company
December 19, 2003


RESPONSE OF THE OFFICE OF INSURANCE PRODUCTS
Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport


DIVISION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
Life Insurance Company


Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 19, 2003, and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life") or Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts ("Keyport Accounts") to Sun Life in connection with the proposed merger of Sun Life and Keyport (the "Merger").  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if: (1) the change in depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Accounts are filed by Sun Life and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport contracts after the Merger is effected.
Similarly, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts ("MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the relevant MVA Contracts, and Sun Life assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such contracts.
Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.  Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusion on the issues presented.

Re:	Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) and Keyport Life Insurance Company
Dear Mr. Kotapish:
We are writing on behalf of Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada (U.S.) ("Sun Life (U.S.)") and Keyport Life Insurance Company ("Keyport") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport:

under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, and Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Keyport transfers its separate accounts, registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts, to Sun Life (U.S.) (the "Transfers") by operation of law in the proposed merger of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport (the "Merger"), as described below; and 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Keyport MVA Contracts"), Keyport transfers to Sun Life (U.S.) assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and Sun Life (U.S.) assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Keyport under such Contracts (the "MVA Transfer"), as described below (the Merger, the Transfers, and the MVA Transfer, and any related transactions are referred to collectively as the "Merger").

In the past, the Commission's staff has granted requests for similar relief.  For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the relief requested here also should be granted.
I.	BACKGROUND
A.	Description of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport
Sun Life (U.S.) is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of Delaware on January 12, 1970.1  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Sun Life (U.S.) issues individual and group life insurance policies and annuity contracts and is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Sun Life (U.S.) had assets of approximately $20 billion.
Sun Life (U.S.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life of Canada (U.S.) Holdings, Inc. ("Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings").  The ultimate parent of Sun Life (U.S.) and Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings is Sun Life Financial Inc. (formerly known as Sun Life Financial Services of Canada, Inc.), a Canadian corporation with common shares listed on the Toronto, New York, and Philippines stock exchanges.
Keyport is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of the State of Rhode Island in 1957.  Its executive office is located at One Sun Life Executive Park, Wellesley Hills, Massachusetts 02481.  Keyport issues individual and group annuity contracts and formerly issued individual life insurance policies.  Keyport is authorized to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands.  As of December 31, 2002, Keyport had assets of approximately $19.6 billion.  Keyport is a wholly owned subsidiary Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, and is therefore under common control with Sun Life (U.S.).
B.	Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and Related Contracts
Sun Life (U.S.) has 20 registered separate accounts (the "Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts"), which fund variable life insurance contracts or variable annuity contracts (collectively, the "Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts").  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Delaware insurance law, and each is registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act2 as a unit investment trust or as an open-end, diversified management investment company.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts supported by the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts which are registered as unit investment trusts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.  The Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.  In addition, certain Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts offer a fixed account investment option that is registered under the 1933 Act.
Clarendon Insurance Agency, Inc. ("Clarendon"), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings, is the principal underwriter for the Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.  Clarendon is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Sun Life (U.S.).
C.	Keyport Accounts and Related Contracts
Keyport has three registered separate accounts (the "Keyport Accounts"):  KMA Variable Account, which funds one variable annuity contract; Variable Account A, which funds 10 variable annuity contracts; and Keyport Variable Account I, which funds one variable life insurance contract.  The Keyport Accounts are separate accounts created pursuant to Rhode Island insurance law, and each is registered as a unit investment trust with the Commission under the 1940 Act.   The variable contracts supported by the Keyport Accounts (the "Keyport Variable Contracts") are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.3  The Keyport Accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests in a series of either an affiliated or unaffiliated open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act.
The Keyport Variable Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.4  Certain Keyport Variable Contracts also offer a general account option, which is not registered with the Commission in reliance on certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions in the federal securities laws.
Keyport Financial Services Corp. ("KFSC"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Keyport, is the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.  KFSC is an "affiliated person" (as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(3) of the 1940 Act) of Keyport.  Following the Merger, it is planned that Clarendon will act as the principal underwriter for the Keyport Contracts.
D.	Keyport MVA Contracts
The Keyport MVA Contracts are fixed account annuity contacts, comprised of group and individual single premium annuity contracts (the "Single Premium MVA Contracts") and group and individual flexible premium annuity contracts (the "Flexible Premium MVA Contracts").  The Keyport MVA Contracts offer two general account options, one of which is subject to a market value adjustment provision.  The Keyport MVA Contracts have no variable investment option.
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Single Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Keyport no longer offers the Single Premium MVA Contracts, is not accepting additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts, and is not filing post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.5
Keyport holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account which is not registered under the 1940 Act.  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts are registered as securities with the Commission under the 1933 Act.6  The Flexible Premium MVA Contracts permit additional payments and allow transfers among the general account options, subject to certain conditions.
The Keyport MVA Contracts, together with the Keyport Variable Contacts, are hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Keyport Contracts."
II.	THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION
A.	The Merger
Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings conducts insurance and related operations through various direct and indirect, wholly owned insurance companies, including Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport.  It proposes to simplify its corporate and operational structure so that it might operate more efficiently and reduce administrative and compliance costs.  To that end, it intends to combine the operations of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport through the Merger.  In June 2003, Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") pursuant to which Keyport will merge with and into Sun Life (U.S.) leaving Sun Life (U.S.) as the surviving company.  The Merger, including the Transfers, the MVA Transfer, and related transactions, has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport and  each party's sole shareholder.  The parties have obtained the other necessary formal regulatory approvals and expect to have the Merger become effective on December 31, 2003.7
Upon the effective date of the Merger ("Effective Date"), Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of Keyport and will become directly liable for Keyport's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Keyport Contracts then outstanding.  Each Keyport Contract owner will become a contract owner of Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Keyport Contracts.  Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Keyport Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Keyport Contracts.  The net unit value of the Keyport Accounts in effect immediately after the transfers will be identical to the net asset value per unit of interest in effect immediately before the transfers.  The Merger Agreement will not affect the current owners of Sun Life (U.S.) Contracts.
The Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts and the Keyport Accounts (collectively, the "Accounts") are not parties to the Merger Agreement, which will be entered into at the insurance company level.  As a result of the Merger, the Accounts, which are registered under the 1940 Act, will continue to maintain their separate account status as unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act and as separate accounts under applicable state insurance law.  The Accounts will not be merged into one another.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Keyport Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated.  Each sub-account of the Keyport Accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger.
The Merger will not directly affect any of the management investment companies underlying either the Keyport Accounts or the Sun Life (U.S.) Accounts (collectively, the "Funds").  The Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction.  The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.  No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Funds, the Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, although the principal underwriter for Keyport may change after the Merger, the principal underwriter will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Life (U.S.) Holdings.
Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport have determined that no provision of the Keyport Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts (the "Keyport Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger.  Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Keyport Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Keyport Contract owners under the 1940 Act.  In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Keyport Contracts will not change, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will become the depositor of the Keyport Accounts.  Consequently, Keyport Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.
All direct and indirect costs of the Merger will be borne by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport and not by any owners of Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport Contracts.
B.	The Transfers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each of the Keyport Accounts will transfer intact to Sun Life (U.S.) and become part of Sun Life (U.S.) on the Effective Date.  Each transferred Keyport Account will change its name, and have Sun Life (U.S.) as its depositor rather than Keyport.  No other changes to the Keyport Accounts will result from the Merger.
The assets and liabilities that comprise the Keyport Accounts immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Sun Life (U.S.), as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, the Keyport Accounts will continue to fund the same Keyport Contracts they did immediately prior to the Merger.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.8  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Keyport Variable Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
C.	The MVA Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Keyport will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts to Sun Life (U.S.), and Sun Life (U.S.) will assume Keyport's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date.  As a result of the Merger, each non-unitized separate account of Keyport that funds the Keyport MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Sun Life (U.S.).  At the same time, Sun Life (U.S.) will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Keyport and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Keyport under the Keyport MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger.
The MVA Transfer will not change the terms of the Keyport MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) as the insurer under the Keyport MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts.
After the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Flex Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Contracts currently being offered.  Sun Life (U.S.) will administer the Flex Premium MVA Contracts in the same manner as Keyport did immediately prior to the Merger.
Sun Life (U.S.) does not intend to offer additional Single Premium MVA Contracts or accept additional payments under outstanding Single Premium MVA Contracts or file post-effective amendments to the 1933 Act registration statement for the Single Premium MVA Contracts.
D.	Procedural Matters
Sun Life (U.S.) will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  The registration statements will include financial statements reflecting consummation of the Merger and reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s sponsorship of the Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger, but will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The prospectuses included in the new registration statements will be sent to all Keyport Contract owners.
Sun Life (U.S.) also will file a new registration statement on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts.  Sun Life (U.S.) will seek to have the registration statement declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  The new registration statement will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport with respect to the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Keyport MVA Contract at the time of the MVA Transfer will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
Following the Effective Date, Sun Life (U.S.) will not make offers or accept payments under the Keyport Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III.	ANALYSIS
A.	Introduction
As discussed more fully below, it is our view, with regard to the proposed Merger (including the Transfers and the MVA Transfer), that: (1) Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder are inapplicable to the Merger, and no registration statements on Form N-14 are required; (2) Section 8 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger; and (3) Section 11 of the 1940 Act is inapplicable to the Merger, but if Section 11 is viewed as applicable to the Merger transactions, the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Neither Sun Life (U.S.) nor Keyport seeks no-action reassurance under Section 17(a) or Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act with respect to the Transfers.9
In support of our views, we note that the proposed Merger is analytically the same as numerous reorganizations that have been the subject of previous no-action requests, seeking substantially identical relief from the provisions of the 1933 Act and 1940 Act noted above, to which the staff responded favorably and which deal with stock and mutual life insurance companies involved in mergers where one or both of such companies issued variable insurance products.10  In connection with the relief sought in this request, the proposed Merger poses no different issues than those present in these previous transactions.
B.	Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 Thereunder Are Inapplicable to the Transfers and the MVA Transfer
1.	Transfers
In our view, the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the Keyport Accounts and co-issuer of the Keyport Variable Contracts, pursuant to the Transfers and any related transactions, will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act or Rule 145 thereunder.  Rule 145, an interpretive rule adopted by the Commission, provides guidance on when certain corporate reorganizations may entail the offer or sale of a new security in exchange for outstanding securities of a corporation involved in the reorganization.11
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,12  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any material change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the sponsor/depositor will be different.  These previously issued no-action letters involve circumstances virtually identical to those presented above: two insurance companies merging where one or both of the companies have variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities that comprised the separate account remained intact after the merger and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the Keyport Accounts will remain intact after the Merger and the assets of each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be legally segregated from all other assets of the depositor and will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name) investing in the same underlying investment vehicles as are currently available under the Keyport Contracts.  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.) (which will be reflected by filing an amendment to each registration statement of a Keyport Account under the 1940 Act), will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that cause them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Variable Contracts, which benefits will continue to be based on the same pool of assets).13 
As discussed above, the Merger is not subject, by either state law or federal securities law, to the vote or consent of the Contract owners of either Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport.  There is no material change to the security aspect of the Keyport Variable Contracts issued by Keyport and no new or different investment options will be made available to the Contract owners as a result of the Merger.  The only changes involved are the change in the depositor of the transferred Keyport Accounts and the assumption of existing Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.).  Since there will be no vote of the Contact owners relating to a new investment decision, or otherwise, Rule 145 does not apply for the same reasons set forth in the aforementioned no-action letters.14   Based on the foregoing, we have concluded that neither Section 5 of the 1933 Act nor Rule 145 thereunder is applicable to the proposed Transfers and any related transactions.
Moreover, with respect to registration statements under the 1933 Act, we believe that no registration statement on Form N-14 will be required to be filed in connection with the Merger.15  Nonetheless, we believe that the registration statements for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts issued through each Keyport Account, as separate accounts of Sun Life (U.S.), need to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Keyport Variable Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file new registration statements with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Keyport Variable Contracts, which registration statements will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
These new registration statements, which will be filed on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, will reflect the change in depositor of the Keyport Accounts and Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Keyport under the Keyport Variable Contracts.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statements also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectuses will be sent to all owners of Keyport Variable Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected, and will retain the historical financial information of the Keyport Accounts and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Keyport Variable Contracts after the Merger.16   Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Keyport Variable Contracts would have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
2.	MVA Transfer
In our view, the MVA Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Keyport MVA Contracts by virtue of the MVA Transfer, except that Sun Life (U.S.) will succeed Keyport as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Keyport MVA Contracts.  These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Keyport will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Keyport MVA Contracts intact to Sun Life (U.S.).  Consequently, when the MVA Transfer becomes effective, Sun Life (U.S.) will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger (including the MVA Transfer) and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options.  Consequently, owners of Keyport MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the MVA Transfer.
We believe, however, that the registration statement for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts needs to be in effect under the 1933 Act to cover any securities issued after the Merger, which may include any additional payments accepted on the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected and any new Flexible Premium MVA Contracts issued thereafter.  As noted above, in connection with effecting the Merger, Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts will file a new registration statement with the Commission under the 1933 Act for the transferred Flexible Premium MVA Contracts, which registration statement will be requested to be declared effective in conjunction with the Merger.
The new registration statement, which will be filed on Form S-3, will reflect Sun Life (U.S.)'s assumption of Keyport's contractual obligations and liabilities with respect to the Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Because the Transfers are to be made in connection with the Merger of Keyport into Sun Life (U.S.), the registration statement also will include appropriate financial information reflecting the Merger.  The new prospectus will be sent to all owners of Flexible Premium MVA Contracts outstanding at the time the Transfers are effected and will disclose that new premium payments will be accepted under the Flexible Premium MVA Contracts after the Merger.  Prior to the Effective Date, owners of outstanding Flexible Premium MVA Contracts will have received disclosure from Keyport informing the owners of the proposed Merger, including the Transfers.
C.	Section 8 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Transfer of the Keyport Accounts.
It is our view that the succession of Sun Life (U.S.) to the position of depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act, and, therefore, can, and should, be effected through the amendment of existing registration statements of the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act.  The filing of these amendments with the Commission will be made as part of the process of filing new 1933 Act registration statements discussed above for the Keyport Contracts.  These amendments will reflect Sun Life (U.S.) as the depositor of the Keyport Accounts and the transfer of contractual obligations and liabilities from Keyport to Sun Life (U.S.) as of the Effective Date.  This procedure will not necessitate the filing of new notifications of registration or registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.
The proposed Merger will cause a change in the depositor for the Keyport Accounts, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the Keyport Contracts.  The resulting change in the depositor due to the Transfers of the Keyport Accounts, however, will not change the structure or operations of the Keyport Accounts or the relationship of the Keyport Accounts to their depositor or to the Keyport Contract owners.  The Keyport Accounts will continue to be treated as separate entities for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts, accordingly, will amend the existing registration statements for the transferred Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act on the Effective Date, as discussed above.
D.	Section 11 of the 1940 Act is Inapplicable to the Merger.
Based on the analysis set forth above relating to Section 5 of the 1933 Act, it also is our view that the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions, will not involve an exchange of securities issued by an investment company for any other security of an investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.  Nonetheless, should these transactions be viewed as an offer of an exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11 of the 1940 Act, we believe that the transactions will comply with the conditions of Section 11(a) of the 1940 Act, and Rule 11a-2 thereunder.  Accordingly, Commission approval should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with effecting the Merger, including the Transfers and any related transactions.
Similar to the facts in previously issued no-action letters,17  the terms of the Merger Agreement will not result in any change to the Keyport Variable Contracts, except that, by operation of law, the identity of the depositor will change.  These previously issued no-action letters involved circumstances substantially similar to those presented above: two insurance companies merging with one or both of the companies having variable contracts outstanding.  Each of the previously issued no-action letters indicates that, just as in this case, the assets and liabilities which comprised the funding separate account after the merger remained intact, and were legally segregated from the other business of the surviving life insurance company.
In this case, the assets in each of the transferred Keyport Accounts will not be combined with those of any other separate account or other entity.  The transferred Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to provide Contract owners with the same rights and benefits after the proposed Merger as before, including surrender rights, loan privileges, annuity options and death benefits.  In addition, the Keyport Variable Contracts will continue to be funded by the transferred Keyport Accounts (albeit under a new name).  The financial history of the transferred Keyport Accounts will be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Sun Life (U.S.), the Keyport Variable Contracts will not change.  Furthermore, the assumption of the insurance guarantees under the Keyport Variable Contracts by Sun Life (U.S.) by operation of state law will not affect those aspects of the Contracts that caused them to be treated as securities (i.e., the variable nature of the benefits under the Keyport Contracts).18 
IV.	NO-ACTION REQUEST
In view of these circumstances, we respectfully request that the staff issue a letter stating that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action against Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Transfers and the MVA Transfer or under Sections 8 and 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Transfers, if the Merger is effect as described herein.  In addition, we request that the staff further indicate in this letter that the staff will not recommend that the Commission take any action if: (1) the change in the depositor for the transferred Keyport Accounts as a result of the Merger is effected through the filing of amendments to the registration statements for the Keyport Accounts under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements for the transferred Keyport Contracts under the 1933 Act are filed by Sun Life (U.S.) and the Keyport Accounts to cover any securities issued in connection with the Keyport Contracts after the Merger is effected.
If you have any question or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me at (202) 965- 8152 or Joan Boros at (202) 965-8150.

7 Regulatory approval of the Merger is necessary in three states.  The Merger has been approved by the state insurance regulators in Delaware and Rhode Island, the domiciliary states of Sun Life (U.S.) and Keyport, respectively, and by the California Department of Insurance.
8 See note 3, supra.  Sun Life (U.S.) currently has no plans to develop and offer additional types of variable contracts through the Keyport Accounts after the Merger.
9 On a number of previous occasions, the Commission staff has been asked to provide no-action assurances (which the staff has granted) under Sections 17(a) and 17(d) of the 1940 Act in situations when insurance companies merged and transferred separate accounts in connection with the merger.  See, e.g., Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. May 17, 1996); Intramerica Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 29, 1992); California-Western States Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 9, 1991); UNUM Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Oct. 24, 1991); Lincoln National Pension Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 29, 1988); and American General Life Ins. Co. of Delaware (pub. avail. Mar. 13, 1986).  The staff has stated in these no-action letters that neither Section 17(a) nor Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act is applicable in the case of a transaction, like the present one. The staff further stated in Metropolitan Life that it does not intend to issue additional no-action letters in this area absent novel facts and circumstances.  We do not believe that novel facts or circumstances are present with respect to the Transfers and the factors discussed in the forgoing letters.
10 See, e.g., Allstate Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 23, 2002); Sun Life Insurance and Annuity Co. of New York (pub. avail. Dec. 20, 2002); The Manufacturers Life In. Co. (pub. avail. Dec. 27, 2001); Aid Association for Lutherans/Lutheran Brotherhood (pub. avail. Dec. 21, 2001); Jefferson Pilot Financial Ins. Co., Alexander Hamilton Life Ins. Co. of America (pub. avail. Aug. 1, 2002); AUSA Life Ins. Co. (pub. avail. Sept. 18, 1998).
11 Rule 145 under the 1933 Act may apply when there is submitted to security holders for a vote or consent a plan or agreement for, among other things, "a statutory merger or consolidation or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation or other person held by such security holders will become or be exchanged for securities of any other person."  According to the Preliminary Note to Rule 145, "the thrust of the Rule is that an 'offer,' 'offer to sell,' 'offer for sale,' or 'sale' occurs when there is submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for their existing security."
12 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
13 The Merger will affect only the insurance aspects of the Keyport Contracts  (i.e., the insurance company guaranteeing the death benefit and certain other contractual rights) and will not affect those aspects that cause the Keyport Contracts to be treated as securities (e.g., the cash surrender value and investment options available through the Keyport Accounts).
14 See the no-action letters cited in note 10 and the accompanying text to note  11, supra.
15 We note that the Form N-14 registration statement, by its terms, does not apply to separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts.
16 While new registration statements will be filed for certain Keyport Variable Contracts that Keyport has ceased offering, Sun Life (U.S.) will rely on prior Commission no-action positions in discontinuing filing post-effective amendments and delivering updated prospectuses to existing owners of these Contracts.  See Great-West, supra note 4.  We are not requesting any no-action assurances from the staff with respect to the reliance by Sun Life (U.S.) or Keyport on these prior staff positions.
17 See the no-action letters cited in note 10, supra.
18 See the accompanying text to note 13, supra.

Feels good to know I have Brad Mclane Agency on my side.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

No matter when you start, you always want to start off on the right foot.
And with a term life insurance policy from New York Life Insurance Company you’re starting off on the best foot possible.

Term life is simple and affordable and you pay a low monthly premium based on the term length and the amount of coverage you need. At the end of your term, you may be able to renew your coverage, often at a higher premium without having to provide evidence of good health. Buying term life insurance can be a wise decision while you are young and healthy, since premiums tend to be much lower. So why wait? Protect the ones you love and keep good going in your life.

The many benefits of a term life insurance policy include:


Affordable premiums: cover yourself, spouse, family or business without breaking the bank
Guaranteed death benefit paid out to a beneficiary or beneficiaries you select
Guaranteed coverage for the duration of the term selected (example: 5, 10, 20 years)
Conversion privilege at the end of the term to a permanent policy (certain limitations apply)

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?

	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

Common Questions


	                            Will my benefit amount ever decrease?
                            




Benefits are guaranteed not to decrease until insurance ends regardless of changes in your age or health.

Premiums are arranged in five-year age bands and will increase as you enter each new band. See rate chart above.




	                            How long can I keep this life insurance?
                            

This term insurance is yours to keep until you reach age 80. All we ask is that you pay your premiums on time and that your application contains no material misrepresentations about your medical history.  This protection can be exchanged for permanent coverage without a medical exam any time until insurance ends at age 80. Rates will be based on your age at that time.




	                            Are there any exclusions or limitations?
                            

Benefits will not be paid for death from suicide in the first two years.*




	                            Will I be required to have a medical exam?
                            


Acceptance is based on your answers to health questions and other information you provide or give us permission to obtain. 
However, during the first two years, New York Life reserves the right to cancel your insurance if
your Application contains material misrepresentations about your medical history. 




	                            What if I answer "yes" to a health question?
                            


Answering “yes” does not automatically disqualify you from coverage. We may contact you to ask for more information or clarification of your answer. Most who apply are accepted.





	                            Why do you need my Social Security Number?
                            


New York Life requires your social security number to verify the individual we are insuring. This assists us in protecting the privacy of your information. Life insurance companies are also
required to obtain a taxpayer identification number (which is your social security number) in the event that we release money to you that could be considered taxable.





	                            What happens after I complete my application?
                            


 You will be contacted in about 7 to 14 business days regarding your application. If approved, a policy will be mailed to you.





	                            How long does it take for coverage to begin, once my application is approved?
                            


 Coverage will take effect on the date shown in your policy – normally seven days after approval of your application. You’ll have full benefits from the day your coverage takes effect.





	                            Can I keep my coverage if my health changes?
                            


 Once approved, changes in your health will not affect your coverage. Also, since it’s your own individual policy, you will remain covered if you change jobs or retire.





	                            How does the 30-Day satisfaction guarantee work?
                            


 You'll receive a policy when coverage is approved. If you decide this coverage isn't for you, for any reason, you can return it within 30 days and receive a refund.





	                            Why should I choose New York Life Insurance Company?
                            

As one of the oldest and largest mutual life insurance companies in the United States, New York Life has been protecting generations of families for more than 170 years.

Best (A++) Highest Rating, Fitch (AAA)Highest Rating, Standard & Poor’s (AA+) Second-Highest Rating, Moody’s Investors Service(Aaa) Highest Rating. Ratings as of 5/01/17.




	                            What is a mutual insurance company?
                            


 It’s a company that is not publicly traded and therefore has no shareholders. Instead, policyholders share in ownership of the company. All New York Life policyholders have the right to expect that our highest priority is to safeguard their interests.





	                            Can I apply for more than $150,000 in coverage?

Footnote
The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential)

Accelerated Death Benefit option is a feature that is made available to group life insurance participants. It is not a health, nursing home, or long-term care insurance benefit and is not designed to eliminate the need for those types of insurance coverage. The death benefit is reduced by the amount of the accelerated death benefit paid. There is no administrative fee to accelerate benefits. Receipt of accelerated death benefits may affect eligibility for public assistance and may be taxable. The federal income tax treatment of payments made under this rider depends upon whether the insured is the recipient of the benefits and is considered “terminally ill” or “chronically ill.” You may wish to seek professional tax advice before exercising this option.
Special rules may apply to residents of Minnesota.
LIMRA, 2015 Annual Survey of U.S. Group Life Insurance.
2015 Statutory Annual Statement of Prudential (Blue Book). Client counts and lives covered are based upon number of contracts and certificates in force on the Exhibit of Life Insurance.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
