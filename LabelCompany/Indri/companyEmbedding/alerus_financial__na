Alerus Financial 
Online Banking Agreement
I. Introduction
Thank you for choosing Online Banking with Alerus Financial!

This Online Banking Agreement (the "Agreement") explains the terms and conditions governing the use of Alerus Financial's Small Business Online Banking Services. All Internet Banking Services of any kind offered by Alerus Financial (including, but not limited to funds transfers and bill payment services) will be referred to collectively as "Services" in this Agreement. The Agreement also contains the terms and conditions governing the Services.

The terms and conditions of your deposit agreements and disclosures for each of your accounts at Alerus Financial as well as your other agreements with Alerus Financial, such as loans, continue to apply notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement.

II. Definitions
As used in this agreement, the following words have the meanings given below.
"Online Banking Services" and "Services" means the services provided pursuant to this Agreement, including bill payment.

"Eligible Accounts" Each Alerus Financial product that you have with us is called an Eligible Account and includes deposit accounts, savings accounts, time accounts and loans, including lines of credit. All eligible accounts will be linked by means of the tax identification number (i.e., social security number or employer identification number) of the account owner(s) or business entity. This means that you will be able to view and access any accounts using the same tax identification number, for which you are a co-owner or authorized signer. Certain accounts with restricted access will not be allowable as Eligible Accounts.

"We," "us," "our" and "Alerus Financial" are used to refer to Alerus Financial, N.A., the depository institution that holds one or more accounts accessed by the Service.

"You" or "your" is used to refer to each person who applies or is authorized by you to use the Services.

"Business Day" means Monday through Friday, except banking holidays.

"Electronic Funds Transfers" means ATM withdrawals, preauthorized transactions, point of sale transactions, transfers to and from your account with us using Online Banking Services, including bill payments. 

"Token" means a random number generator, USB key or similar security device supplied by Alerus Financial to Customer, which is required in conjunction with Customer ID, User ID and password to log in to Alerus Financial's Small Business Online Banking Services.

III. Access to Service
In order for you to use the Services described in this Agreement, you must have at least one Eligible Account with us and access to Internet service. In addition, if you enroll for Bill Payment Services, you must have a Deposit Account that is a checking account with us.

Alerus Financial customers can register online by selecting the "Accept" button at the end of this Agreement. To register online you must then complete all required information fields on the enrollment form. By completing the online enrollment form, you authorize us to treat your enrollment form as if it had been in writing and signed by you. If you are enrolling on behalf of a business, by selecting the accept button you certify that you are authorized to enter into this agreement. Once we have received your enrollment form online and verified your account information, we will send you by e-mail a confirmation of our acceptance of your enrollment. Upon acceptance, a password will be mailed by postal mail within 72 hours if the enrollment form is received prior to 4:00 P.M. CST or within 48 hours if received after 4:00 P.M. CST. 

All Eligible Accounts which you have with Alerus Financial will be linked to your Online Banking Services. If you would like an account removed from your Eligible Accounts, please contact us at 701.795.2662 in Grand Forks, ND, at 701.280.5151 in Fargo/West Fargo, ND, or by calling 1.800.279.3200, ext 2662.

You agree that we may send confidential mailings, including your temporary password, to the current address shown in our records for your primary checking account. You further agree that we will not be responsible or liable to you in any way in the event that such properly addressed information is intercepted by an unauthorized person, either in transit or at your place of residence.

IV. Security and Use of Your Password
We are committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of our customer account information. We take measures to protect confidentiality and security of your account. We use several different methods to ensure this security and protect your account information: 
� You can only access Online Banking with certain browsers that have a high security standard. Acceptable browsers include either Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater or Netscape Navigator 6.2 or greater, with 128-bit encryption. 
� You must have a valid User ID, Customer ID, password, and token to sign in. 
� Your password is not displayed on the login screen. 
� If no action is taken for 10 minutes, you will automatically be logged off Online Banking Services. 
� Your account will be locked out for 30 minutes after 5 invalid signon attempts. This will count as 1 lockout. Your account can be locked out temporarily (30 minutes) a total of 2 times. After the 2nd temporary lockout, you will be permanently locked out and will need to contact us at 701.795.2662 in Grand Forks, ND, at 701.280.5151 in Fargo/West Fargo, ND, or by calling 1.800.279.3200, ext 2662.
� You will be required to select two Security Questions and Answers at the time of enrollment. We will use this information to verify your identity at the time you call us with a request, such as reactivating your access with a temporary password.

We also urge you to take measures to protect your account information. You will be provided with a Customer ID, User ID, password, and token and that will give you access to your Eligible Accounts. For security purposes, you are required to change your password upon your initial login to Online Banking Services.  We require that you create a password that is case-sensitive and between 8-16 characters in length. Your password must include at least one alpha and one numeric character. Your password should not be associated with any commonly known personal identification. 

To change your password at a later date, click on the Password button and select Change Password. You will then have the opportunity to change your password. You may also call us at 701.795.2662 in Grand Forks, ND, at 701.280.5151 in Fargo/West Fargo, ND, or by calling 1.800.279.3200, ext 2662 to reactivate your access with a temporary password.

Any authorized signatory of your business deposit account(s) has authority to enter into this agreement, access all eligible accounts, and utilize all functions provided within this service. One User ID and password will be assigned to a business. In addition one set of security questions and answers will be completed by the individual enrolling. It is the responsibility of the business to maintain security procedures to ensure that the User ID, password, token and security question answers are provided only to those individuals within the business who are authorized to access eligible accounts and utilize functions available through the Online Services. 

You agree to assume responsibility for all transactions initiated through the Service with your User ID and password, up to the limits allowed by law. We have no responsibility for establishing the identity of any person or determining the validity of any transaction received using your User ID, password, and token. You also agree never to leave your account information displayed in an area accessible to others and to never leave your PC unattended while using Online Banking Services. We will not be liable for and will not reimburse you for any losses that may occur as a result of the use of your User ID and password.

If any authorized representative of your business is no longer an authorized user of this service, it is recommended that you change your password to prevent any unauthorized usage. You agree to notify us immediately if you lose your token or you suspect that your User ID or password has become known to any unauthorized person.  Contact us immediately at 701.795.2662 in Grand Forks, ND, at 701.280.5151 in Fargo/West Fargo, ND, or by calling 1.800.279.3200, ext 2662, if you suspect any unauthorized use. Do not report possible security problems by email. Never include your login information or account information in any email.

V. Online Transactions
Types of Online Transactions
You can use Online Banking to check the balance of your accounts, place stop payments, view account histories, transfer funds among your accounts, and pay bills in the amounts and on the dates you request if you have enrolled in Alerus Business Bill Pay service. 

Scheduling Transfers
You may schedule a transfer to be initiated on the same day, or any future calendar day or to be automatically initiated in a fixed amount on a recurring basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.) between your Eligible Accounts. Transfers may be made in any amount not exceeding the available balance plus the undisbursed line of credit in your Eligible Account from which the transfers are made. 

To change a Scheduled Transfer, click the “Set-up” tab then click on the “Misc maintenance” button, then click on the “Maintain recurring items” button.  Select the account from which the transfer is to occur, modify the appropriate information and click on “Update” to send the changes, or click “delete” to cancel the transfer.

The following options can be changed: 
� The next transfer date 
� Expiration date if a recurring transfer
� Transfer amount. 

Stop Payments
To place a stop payment click on the "Stop Payment" tab, then select the account on which you want to place the stop payment from the drop down box.  You may only place a stop payment on a check.  If you wish to place a stop payment on a bill payment, electronic payment, or other type of payment, please contact our Customer Care Center at 701.795.2662 in Grand Forks, ND, at 701.280.5151 in Fargo/West Fargo, ND, or by calling 1.800.279.3200, ext 2662.  If you are unsure whether the item has cleared, click on the “History” button to display cleared items.  Enter the information required, then click on the "Submit" button to send the stop payment to the bank. You will receive a confirmation receipt. 

The stop payment will immediately be placed on your account for a period of fourteen days. You will receive a letter within a few days that needs to be signed and returned to the bank in order to keep the stop payment in place for 6 months. There will be an $18 fee assessed to your account for the stop payment.

Those nights you hear everything. Walls are thin. You can hear conversations through the walls. ||[]||[]Pet-friendly which is great. However there is dog poop and pee all over the sidewalks which is not so great. We have yellow and brown snow...not to appealing when you have guests over. ||[]||[]The apartment itself is nice, low maintenance. ||[]||[]The bad part: once you sign the lease you never see or hear from the managers again unless it's bad news. When I moved in no one told me where the garbage was located, where parking spaces were, no details. They just wanted my name on the line with a check to follow. I have had several minor maintenance questions and get no response. We have had several bad storms push through and they will not shovel snow or put de-icer/sand on the sidewalks. After the 6" snow they finally shoveled and sanded 4 days later. It's ridiculous. ||[]||[]I would say for the price you can find better elsewhere.

History[edit]




322 DeMers Avenue, former home of First National Bank until the Red River Flood of 1997






The Corporate Center, current home of Alerus Financial's downtown Grand Forks branch


Alerus Financial's history dates back to August 29, 1879 with the formation of the Bank of Grand Forks by Mr. S. S. Titus. The bank was the second bank chartered in Dakota Territory. At the time, the bank was located in the back of a smokehouse on South Third Street in downtown Grand Forks. The bank quickly outgrew its building and moved into a new brick structure at the corner of South Third Street and Kittson Avenue.
In 1881, the bank took out a federal charter and became known as Citizens National Bank. On July 1, 1890, the bank purchased another Grand Forks bank and took on the name of the other bank: First National Bank. In 1896, the newly merged First National Bank moved into the St. John's Block building at the corner of DeMers Avenue and Third Street. This corner was viewed by most as the commercial center of Grand Forks and the bank's five-story building dominated the intersection. The bank later relocated to another five-story building which was located at 322 DeMers Avenue, one block west of the St. John's Block.
The bank's headquarters would remain in this building until the devastating Red River Flood of 1997. During the disaster, the bank's downtown building was both flooded and almost destroyed in a fire which burned out of control. After the flood, the bank moved their corporate headquarters to a location in south Grand Forks and moved their downtown location into a new city-owned office complex known as the Corporate Center. The vacated 322 DeMers Avenue building was totally remodeled by another party and is now an office building.
In 2000, First National Bank changed its name to Alerus Financial. The new name comes from the Latin word alera which means "to take flight". In 2001, the city of Grand Forks opened a huge indoor stadium and convention center known as the Alerus Center. Alerus purchased the naming rights for this facility.
In 2003, Alerus expanded into Minneapolis when it acquired Pension Solutions Inc., which was renamed Alerus Retirement Solutions.[1]
In 2014, Alerus Financial bought Private Bank Minnesota in downtown Minneapolis, the ninth such acquisition since 2003.[2]
In 2015, Alerus Financial rebranded itself as simply Alerus, though its legal name did not change.[3]
In 2016, Alerus purchased Beacon Bank in the Twin Cities and Duluth, Minnesota, adding 5 bank branches to its network.[4] It also purchased Alliance Benefit Group North Central States, Inc. (ABG), in Albert Lea, Minnesota.[5] Through the ABG acquisition, Alerus expanded its offerings to include HSA/FSA/HRA, payroll administration, and COBRA services.

Today[edit]
Alerus operates 5 full-service banks and wealth management offices in Greater Grand Forks and 3 full-service banks and wealth management offices in Fargo-Moorhead in North Dakota. Alerus expanded into Minneapolis-St. Paul in 2003 and now operates 6 banks, 3 residential mortgage offices, and 1 wealth management office in the Twin Cities. Alerus entered the Phoenix, Arizona market in 2009, where it operates 1 full-service banking and wealth management office. It also operates 2 banks in Duluth, Minnesota, as a result of the Beacon Bank acquisition.
Alerus operates Alerus Retirement and Benefits, a national retirement services and health benefits provider based in Arden Hills, Minnesota. Alerus Retirement and Benefits has 2 offices in Minnesota, 2 offices in Michigan and 1 office in New Hampshire. It serves customers in 50 states.[6]

History[edit]




322 DeMers Avenue, former home of First National Bank until the Red River Flood of 1997






The Corporate Center, current home of Alerus Financial's downtown Grand Forks branch


Alerus Financial's history dates back to August 29, 1879 with the formation of the Bank of Grand Forks by Mr. S. S. Titus. The bank was the second bank chartered in Dakota Territory. At the time, the bank was located in the back of a smokehouse on South Third Street in downtown Grand Forks. The bank quickly outgrew its building and moved into a new brick structure at the corner of South Third Street and Kittson Avenue.
In 1881, the bank took out a federal charter and became known as Citizens National Bank. On July 1, 1890, the bank purchased another Grand Forks bank and took on the name of the other bank: First National Bank. In 1896, the newly merged First National Bank moved into the St. John's Block building at the corner of DeMers Avenue and Third Street. This corner was viewed by most as the commercial center of Grand Forks and the bank's five-story building dominated the intersection. The bank later relocated to another five-story building which was located at 322 DeMers Avenue, one block west of the St. John's Block.
The bank's headquarters would remain in this building until the devastating Red River Flood of 1997. During the disaster, the bank's downtown building was both flooded and almost destroyed in a fire which burned out of control. After the flood, the bank moved their corporate headquarters to a location in south Grand Forks and moved their downtown location into a new city-owned office complex known as the Corporate Center. The vacated 322 DeMers Avenue building was totally remodeled by another party and is now an office building.
In 2000, First National Bank changed its name to Alerus Financial. The new name comes from the Latin word alera which means "to take flight". In 2001, the city of Grand Forks opened a huge indoor stadium and convention center known as the Alerus Center. Alerus purchased the naming rights for this facility.
In 2003, Alerus expanded into Minneapolis when it acquired Pension Solutions Inc., which was renamed Alerus Retirement Solutions.[1]
In 2014, Alerus Financial bought Private Bank Minnesota in downtown Minneapolis, the ninth such acquisition since 2003.[2]
In 2015, Alerus Financial rebranded itself as simply Alerus, though its legal name did not change.[3]
In 2016, Alerus purchased Beacon Bank in the Twin Cities and Duluth, Minnesota, adding 5 bank branches to its network.[4] It also purchased Alliance Benefit Group North Central States, Inc. (ABG), in Albert Lea, Minnesota.[5] Through the ABG acquisition, Alerus expanded its offerings to include HSA/FSA/HRA, payroll administration, and COBRA services.

Today[edit]
Alerus operates 5 full-service banks and wealth management offices in Greater Grand Forks and 3 full-service banks and wealth management offices in Fargo-Moorhead in North Dakota. Alerus expanded into Minneapolis-St. Paul in 2003 and now operates 6 banks, 3 residential mortgage offices, and 1 wealth management office in the Twin Cities. Alerus entered the Phoenix, Arizona market in 2009, where it operates 1 full-service banking and wealth management office. It also operates 2 banks in Duluth, Minnesota, as a result of the Beacon Bank acquisition.
Alerus operates Alerus Retirement and Benefits, a national retirement services and health benefits provider based in Arden Hills, Minnesota. Alerus Retirement and Benefits has 2 offices in Minnesota, 2 offices in Michigan and 1 office in New Hampshire. It serves customers in 50 states.[6]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
