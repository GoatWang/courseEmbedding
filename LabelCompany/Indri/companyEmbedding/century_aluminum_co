They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Strengths:  The great thing is Protolabs/ First Cut is their extremely fast with parts.   For a small fee you can have your parts expedited in a week.  They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Needs to improve:  They cannot hold tight tolerances on the parts.   They do have a limit on the overall size for their parts - at the time it was less then 8" in length.   That may have changed as I have not used them within the last year or so.  Again they cannot get second operations or sourcing done.

Have ordered from them more than once and will continue if I need one-off or low quantity parts.  Great for manufacturing fixtures.   Strengths:  The whole process is quick and seamless.  The Quoting Process is quick and accurate.  Costs are competitive and you get charged what the quoting system says.  The orders can be made online and parts ship when made.   Needs to improve:  Biggest weakness is that they offer no inspection services that I am aware of.  The tolerances are a bit generous as well.  So, it's not good for precision parts.
Other weaknesses are that they don't have a Mac version of the part visualization plug-in and are ISO 13485 certified.

Proto Labs: Design Aids













































Search
My Account























Design Aids
Learn about the design elements, materials, and surface finishes of injection-molded parts by registering for our free design aids.


 









Design Cube
One of the best ways to learn about our injection molding process is to have an actual plastic part in your hands to explore. That’s why we created the Design Cube, which shows part features that are too thin or too thick, bad bosses, right and wrong ribs, and other considerations to be mindful of while designing parts for injection molding.

Protogami
The three-dimensional flexagons of the Protogami create a continual kaleidocycle that exposes a different set of triangular faces with each turn of its living hinges. This design aid lets product designers and engineers see commonly used plastic materials molded in a range of different surface finishes.
 
 

 



Demo Mold
This design aid shows the mechanics of how the A-side and B-side of a tool work together during the injection molding process to create plastic parts. The Demo Mold demonstrates the functionality of side-actions, sprues and runners, ejector pins and plates, and the relationship between core and cavity. It helps those new to injection molding easily visualize the process and is a great teaching device for educators.

Torus
The Torus is filled with complexities: bayonets, text on ribs, gears, bump-offs, clip cams, and more. We created this design aid to illustrate that intricate part features can still be achieved through rapid manufacturing processes. The Torus has a trio of interconnected sections, each highlighting features that serve various purposes in part design.
 

 







 
Material Selectors
These pocket-sized Material Selectors are quick reference guides to help you identify the right plastic and metal materials for your next project. It lists specific measurements on properties to ensure you have the most suitable material and process for your part’s application.

Sebree, KY
Century’s Sebree aluminum smelter has a production capacity of approximately 218,000 metric tonnes per year. The facility is 100-percent owned and operated through Century Aluminum.
Sebree is located in Henderson County, Kentucky, perfectly situated in the middle of the Midwestern market. It is an ideal location to conduct business as a large majority of the smelter’s customers are within a 600 mile region. Since it began operations in 1973, more than 10 billion pounds of aluminum have been created.
Century Aluminum Sebree employs 506 workers within the tri-state region – it is one of the largest manufacturers in the area. Economically, the plant supports the region with approximately $3 million annually in state and local taxes; around $45 million in purchases from regional vendors; and another $35 million in wages and salaries.
There are three production departments at Sebree:
Potlines (Reduction)
There are three potlines, each containing 128 aluminum pots.
Casting
All of the potlines’ molten metal is transported by a cruce truck to the Casting department. In Casting, employees turn the new aluminum into two primary products: billet and low-profile sow. Cast billet resembles a 20-foot telephone pole, which is then heat treated and cut to customer specifications. While sow is shipped to various customers who re-melt it for blending and casting into various shapes, billet is shipped to extruders who apply pressure and heat to re-shape the billet into such things as air conditioning coils and window frames.
Electrode
This department creates carbon blocks in a newly installed baking system. Each block weights approximately 1,700 pounds each and are made, baked and then shipped to Potlines where they are put inside each pot to conduct electricity. Very few locations in the United States make their own carbon blocks.
Production Support:
Keeping the facility running efficiently is the Maintenance department where experienced employees work around the clock for all departments.
Sebree takes pride in its safety record and makes safety a priority every day.

Hawesville, KY
 

Our Hawesville, Ky. facility is our largest U.S. plant, with a production capacity of approximately 252,000 metric tonnes per year (mtpy). The facility is 100-percent owned and operated through our wholly owned subsidiary, Century Kentucky, Inc.
We believe that Hawesville has a competitive advantage as the largest producer of high purity aluminum in North America. Four of Hawesville’s five potlines are specially configured and operated to produce high purity primary aluminum. The average purity level of primary aluminum produced by these potlines is 99.9 percent, compared to standard-purity aluminum which is approximately 99.7 percent. High-purity primary aluminum is generally sold at a premium to standard-purity aluminum.
Aluminum from the Hawesville smelter supplies the electrical conductor, remelt ingot and high-purity ingot markets, as well as the defense and aerospace industries. A large portion of Hawesville’s specially configured facility provides the high-conductivity metal required by Hawesville’s largest customer, Southwire, for its electrical wire, cable and certain aerospace products.
Our high-purity product also supports the United States’ national security efforts and is used in defense applications such as the F16, Airbus, Naval war vessels, 747 airplanes and the International Space Station.
Economic Impact
Century Aluminum is a major contributor to the Hawesville economy. We offer attractive benefits packages to our employees among the best in the region.
According to a study done by Younger Associates in December 2011, during the prior fiscal year, local property taxes paid directly by Century Aluminum exceeded $800,000. Tax revenues generated indirectly by Century’s operations were estimated to exceed $1.5 million, creating a total local tax revenue impact of more than $2.3 million annually.1

Our proprietary software and automated manufacturing processes allow for quick-turn injection molding, CNC machining and additive manufacturing. Within our three services, we have multiple rapid prototyping and production processes to choose from. Each process serves a distinct purpose, from concept models to form, fit and function testing to short-run production that bridges the gap to large-scale manufacturing.
Product developers can upload their 3D CAD model online and receive an interactive quote with free design analysis and real-time pricing information within hours. The manufacturability analysis helps customers eliminate problems, like sink or internal undercuts, during prototyping so modifications can be made early and often. It’s an iterative process that lets designers and engineers avoid development speed bumps, so they can get their products to market as fast as possible.

They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Strengths:  The great thing is Protolabs/ First Cut is their extremely fast with parts.   For a small fee you can have your parts expedited in a week.  They are interested in getting parts to their customers quick - the basis for their company philosophy.   Needs to improve:  They cannot hold tight tolerances on the parts.   They do have a limit on the overall size for their parts - at the time it was less then 8" in length.   That may have changed as I have not used them within the last year or so.  Again they cannot get second operations or sourcing done.

Have ordered from them more than once and will continue if I need one-off or low quantity parts.  Great for manufacturing fixtures.   Strengths:  The whole process is quick and seamless.  The Quoting Process is quick and accurate.  Costs are competitive and you get charged what the quoting system says.  The orders can be made online and parts ship when made.   Needs to improve:  Biggest weakness is that they offer no inspection services that I am aware of.  The tolerances are a bit generous as well.  So, it's not good for precision parts.
Other weaknesses are that they don't have a Mac version of the part visualization plug-in and are ISO 13485 certified.

Strengths:  Fast turnaround, accurate parts, great quality   Needs to improve:  Extremely expensive for larger parts (greater than ~8x8"), i.e. if you wanted panels        Comment      0      0          Share     LinkedIn    Facebook    Twitter    Google Plus    Email                   Good Lead times - Fast Turn           backa      Manufacturing,  Medical Device 08/01/2015       Speed 4 /  Price 4 /  Quality 3     3D Printing   Metal CNC Machining   Plastic CNC Machining   CNC Prototypes   SLA - Stereolithography      Fast Turn - Price is competitive - On Time Delievery is good - Quality is Fair   Strengths:  Our R&D department use TapProtolabs/ First Cut as a source for their prototypes.

Strengths:  Very fast machining of plastic and metal parts.   Needs to improve:  Firstcut does not always offer secondary operations such as threading.  Not a big deal given the very rapid turnaround and the fact that one can very easily do this on their own.

Proto Labs: Design Aids













































Search
My Account























Design Aids
Learn about the design elements, materials, and surface finishes of injection-molded parts by registering for our free design aids.


 









Design Cube
One of the best ways to learn about our injection molding process is to have an actual plastic part in your hands to explore. That’s why we created the Design Cube, which shows part features that are too thin or too thick, bad bosses, right and wrong ribs, and other considerations to be mindful of while designing parts for injection molding.

Protogami
The three-dimensional flexagons of the Protogami create a continual kaleidocycle that exposes a different set of triangular faces with each turn of its living hinges. This design aid lets product designers and engineers see commonly used plastic materials molded in a range of different surface finishes.
 
 

 



Demo Mold
This design aid shows the mechanics of how the A-side and B-side of a tool work together during the injection molding process to create plastic parts. The Demo Mold demonstrates the functionality of side-actions, sprues and runners, ejector pins and plates, and the relationship between core and cavity. It helps those new to injection molding easily visualize the process and is a great teaching device for educators.

Torus
The Torus is filled with complexities: bayonets, text on ribs, gears, bump-offs, clip cams, and more. We created this design aid to illustrate that intricate part features can still be achieved through rapid manufacturing processes. The Torus has a trio of interconnected sections, each highlighting features that serve various purposes in part design.
 

 







 
Material Selectors
These pocket-sized Material Selectors are quick reference guides to help you identify the right plastic and metal materials for your next project. It lists specific measurements on properties to ensure you have the most suitable material and process for your part’s application.

What is "Mbps" and how much do I need


Mbps, or megabits per second, is the speed of your Internet connection. Higher Mbps speeds will load web pages more quickly, allow more devices to run on the same connection simultaneously, and enable fast download speeds for music, photos, streaming movies and more.









Go with CenturyLink® High-Speed Internet and  choose from a wide range of available speeds.
