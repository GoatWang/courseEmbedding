Multiphysics
We live in a world where multiple physical forces are at play, and the products we produce are often subject to many of these physical forces simultaneously. Fluid forces, thermal effects, structural integrity and electromagnetic radiation can all impact performance of products and industrial processes. If you try to isolate the multiple forces in play, you may not get an accurate prediction of behavior. ANSYS multiphysics solutions can help engineers examine these effects in combination and isolation, achieving the highest fidelity solution when it's needed.
Deep, proven solver technology from ANSYS is a given. Applying this solver technology to multiphysics simulation is the next step for many engineers. See below for the range of ANSYS multiphysics offering available to meet your needs.

check with your IT department to confirm that the default port numbers
are valid or to get different port numbers if necessary. Specify the hostname for your license server machine(s).Click the Next arrow.All products available in the installation package(s) you downloaded are listed. The
            installation program attempts to query your license server to pre-select your
            installation options. If the query is successful, the following message is
            displayed:Your installation options were pre-selected based upon
information from your license server.If the
installation program was unable to query your license server, this
message is not displayed and the default installation options are
selected.You can select or deselect any combination of
products. ANSYS Workbench is automatically installed with most ANSYS, Inc.
products; there is no individual product selection for ANSYS Workbench.If you select AutoCAD, Catia V5, Inventor, NX, Creo Parametric, Solid Edge, or
            SolidWorks, you will have additional installation steps. These steps are completed on
            the CAD Configuration screen which is displayed when
            you click the Next arrow. For additional information on
            completing these steps, please see Specifying CAD Configurations.
Note:  As of Release 17.0 the MechASAS package is no
                longer installed with the ANSYS Mechanical
                Products. This package is required when using BEAMCHECK and FATJACK
                assessment types with Design Assessment. If you
                need the MechASAS package, please download it from
                the ANSYS Customer Portal.
By
default, the Install Documentation option is
enabled (checked). When enabled, help documentation is included as
part of the installation process for all products selected. No
help documentation is included with the installation if this box is
disabled (unchecked).You will also see an estimate of
the disk space required to install all of the selected components,
and the disk space you have available. The actual amount of disk space
required may be less, but if you choose to run the installation with
insufficient disk space available, we strongly recommend that you
review the log files at the end of the installation to verify that
all products were installed correctly. Installation log files are
written to the installation directory.Note:  On
a first time installation, if you chose to install any ANSYS
Geometry Interfaces, ensure that you have also selected at least
one ANSYS, Inc. product as part of the installation. Installing
an ANSYS Geometry Interface without an underlying ANSYS,
Inc. product on a first time installation may cause installation
errors.Select/deselect the products you want to install and click the Next
            arrow.The dates on the licensing files being installed are compared to
any that may already exist on your machine. (This may take a few moments.)A summary of the selected installation data appears. Review the information carefully, and if
            correct, click the Next arrow to continue the
            installation.The installation progress screen displays a status bar
towards the bottom of the installation window. This status bar tracks
the percentage of packages that have been installed on your computer.
Depending on the number of products you have selected, the installation
time required could be lengthy. You will not be able to interrupt
the installation process. Please be patient while the installation
completes.Note:  Clicking the View Details Progress Log button opens a second window that displays the name of each product
package as it is uncompressed and installed.The installation program will first check your system to determine
if you have the necessary prerequisites. If the prerequisites are
not already on your system, the prerequisites will be installed automatically.
You may be asked to run the necessary files (such as the .NET exe),
or to reboot your machine, depending on your existing machine configuration.
If you are asked, you will need to reboot in order to complete the
prerequisite installation successfully. Click the Next arrow to continue the installation.The product installation window reappears with a message
noting that the installation is complete. A Launch Survey
Upon Exiting option is included here. Clicking Exit while the Launch Survey Upon Exiting is enabled causes your default browser to open, displaying the product
survey. Disabling (un-checking) the Launch Survey Upon
Exiting option and then clicking Exit skips the survey.Note:  If prerequisite components
necessary for the installation of the ANSYS products were installed,
the following message may be displayed:A system restart is required before using any ANSYS
Products.4.2.1.1. Network Server and Product ConfigurationTo complete a network installation (where the product is installed
on one machine and multiple clients access that installation to run
the product) to a file server machine, follow the steps below. A network
installation must be homogeneous, although you can install on different
operating systems. Install the product(s) to be shared in a location that
all clients can access. Install all platforms that this machine will
host as described in Product Installation with Client Licensing. You must share the entire \ANSYS Inc directory,
not just the \v170 directory. If
mapping a drive to the shared location, it must be mapped to the \ANSYS Inc folder.Open the Product Configuration Manager (\\fileservermachine\ANSYS Inc\v170\ProductConfig.exe). Select Install Required Prerequisites.
You must be logged in as an administrative user to install the prerequisites.
This step must be completed on all client Windows systems.A configuration status screen appears. This screen displays
the required prerequisite installation process. Once the process is
complete, click Exit. The Product
Configuration Manager remains open.On each Windows client, update the .NET security settings.
By default, the .NET 3.5 Framework prevents applications from being
run over a network. In order to install over a network, each Windows
client that accesses the shared directory requires a modification
to its security settings. This modification allows the .NET binaries
that are located under the \ANSYS Inc directory
on the shared machine to be run from the network. To make this modification
from the Product Configuration Manager, select Add .NET
security exception for ANSYS, Inc. products. You must
have administrative privileges to modify the security policy.To understand the implications of this security exception for
.NET, please contact your system administrator or see Microsoft’s
website http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7c9c2y1w(v=vs.80).aspx.Alternatively, you can allow network execution manually
rather than using the Add .NET security exception for ANSYS,
Inc. products option of the Product Configuration Manager.
The Add .NET security exception for ANSYS, Inc. products option runs the Caspol utility, which is located under the .NET
Framework installation, in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727 for a 64-bit machine. You can run this utility manually in a command
prompt window to open full trust to files on the shared drive. On a 64-bit machine, run the following command:<os drive>\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\Caspol.exe -m -ag
     <CodeGroup> -url file://x:/* FullTrustwhere x is the mapped drive or UNC
path where the product is installed, and CodeGroup is the appropriate Caspol permissions level. We recommend a CodeGroup setting of 1.2. If that setting does not
work or is not appropriate for your environment, please see the Caspol
documentation available from Microsoft or contact your system administrator.You must install Caspol as an administrative user. If running this from the command line on
              Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, you must start the command prompt as
              Administrator, or the command will fail.If you are sharing the Mechanical APDL product, edit the tlbrlist170.ans file, located in \v170\ansys\gui\en-us\toolbars on the Windows
file server. The file should read as follows:\\fileservermachine\ANSYS Inc\v170\ansys\gui\en-us\toolbars\ANSYSSTANDARD.TLB

\\fileservermachine\ANSYS Inc\v170\ansys\gui\en-us\toolbars\ANSYSGRAPHICAL.TLBFor all types of network installations, from each client
Windows machine, you will need to run ProductConfig.exe. If the Product Configuration Manager has been closed, please reopen
it as described above.Select Configure Products.Select the products you want to configure. Click Configure.Note:  CFD-Post is automatically configured when CFX, Fluent, Polyflow,
or Icepak is configured, or if CFD-Post is selected.An informational message box appears as each product is
configured.All operations and error messages that are
encountered while using the product configuration (or unconfiguration)
option are written to the productConfig.txt file
in the %TEMP% directory of the client machine.
No log files are written to the machine that is hosting ProductConfig.exe. Note:   ProductConfig.exe
can also be run in batch mode using the ‘-silent' flag, which
may be useful for automating configuration for multiple systems or
across a Microsoft Windows HPC cluster. For more information see Silent Mode Operations.Select Configure CADs.The CAD Configuration Manager opens. Run this utility for all of the CAD products you need to
configure. See Using the CAD Configuration
Manager for detailed instructions on running this utility,
or select Help from the menu bar in the CAD Configuration Manager.When the configuration is completed, you will see shortcuts to each product in Windows 7 under

                17.0).Select Unconfigure Products.Select the products you want to unconfigure. Click Unconfigure. When unconfiguring products, be aware that
WB/Common should be unconfigured last, after all other products are
unconfigured. If you are unconfiguring some but not all products,
do NOT unconfigure WB/Common, or your remaining products will not
run correctly.CFD-Post CFD-Post can be configured as a standalone
product; however, as a standalone product, it is also automatically
configured with Fluent, Polyflow, and Icepak. To unconfigure CFD-Post,
you must select all of these products to unconfigure, regardless if
they are configured locally.If you choose to unconfigure standalone CFD-Post without
unconfiguring the other products, you will not be able to proceed
with the unconfigure. You will need to revise your selections before
continuing.If you choose to unconfigure all of the other products
that include CFD-Post but you do not select CFD-Post, then CFD-Post will
not be unconfigured.The user interface billboard displays the status of each
product as it is unconfigured. The shortcuts to each product are now
removed.4.2.1.2. Specifying CAD ConfigurationsSelecting AutoCAD, Catia V5, Inventor, NX, Creo Parametric, Solid Edge, or
          SolidWorks from the product selection screen and clicking the Next arrow displays the CAD Configuration screen. This screen contains the
          configuration properties for each CAD product that you have selected in an expanded
          "accordion" view.You can use the following instructions to configure the appropriate CAD properties.
          After configuring your CAD products or deciding to perform the configuration at a later
          time, click the Next arrow.If you have not yet installed the related CAD programs, or do not know the requested
          information, you can choose to skip these configuration steps by selecting the Skip all and configure later using CAD Configuration Manager
          option located on the lower left-had portion of the screen. If you skip these steps, you
          will need to manually configure these CAD interfaces using the CAD
            Configuration Manager before you can successfully import models into Mechanical APDL,
          ANSYS Workbench, or ICEM CFD. You can access the CAD Configuration
            Manager in Windows 7 (Start > All Programs > ANSYS 17.0 > Utilities > CAD Configuration
            Manager 17.0), Windows 8.1 (Right-click
            the Start Screen> All apps> ANSYS 17.0 > CAD Configuration Manager
            17.0) and in Windows 10 (Start > All
            apps> ANSYS 17.0 > CAD Configuration Manager
            17.0). See Configuring CAD Products for more
          information on using the CAD Configuration Manager.AutoCADIf you selected AutoCAD as one of your CAD products, you will have to choose which
              AutoCAD product to configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative), Workbench
              Associative Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip and
              configure later (using the CAD Configuration Manager).
            CATIA V5If you selected CATIA V5 and any product that includes ANSYS Workbench, you will be
              required to select the appropriate CAD reader/plugin for ANSYS Workbench. You can choose to
              configure the Reader, CADNexus CAPRI CAE Gateway, or skip and configure later (using
              the CAD Configuration Manager). Autodesk InventorIf you selected Inventor as one of your CAD products, you will have to choose
              which Inventor product to configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative),
              Workbench Associative Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip
              and configure later (using the CAD Configuration
                Manager). NXIf you selected NX, you will have to choose which NX
              product to configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative), Workbench
              Associative Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip and
              configure later (using the CAD Configuration Manager).
            If you choose the Workbench Associative Interface and the UGII environment
              variables were not set, you may need to specify the NX installation path
              for an existing NX installation. If you are an administrative user, a
              file required to load the NX plug-in is placed in the administrative
              user's Application Data folder by default, which may not be accessible by other,
              non-administrative users. To allow non-administrative users to run, you will need to
              define the environment variable UGII_CUSTOM_DIRECTORY_FILE prior to
              installation and specify a location where other users have read access. Alternatively,
              you can run the CAD Configuration Manager after the
              installation and provide an updated location for the NX Custom Directory File Path
              under the NX tab.If you selected the ANSYS ICEM CFD NX Interface product but not the NX Geometry
              Interface product on the product selection screen, you may need to specify the
              NX installation path or choose to skip configuring NX and
              use the CAD Configuration Manager to configure
              later.Creo ParametricIf you selected Creo Parametric, you will have to choose which Creo Parametric product to
              configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative), Workbench Associative
              Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip and configure later
              (using the CAD Configuration Manager). If you choose the Workbench Associative Interface, you may need to specify the
              Creo Parametric language, the Creo Parametric command, and the full Creo Parametric installation
              path (C:\Program Files\PTC\Creo 1.0\Parametric by default) for an
              existing Creo Parametric installation. SolidWorksIf you selected SolidWorks as one of your CAD products, you will have to choose
              which SolidWorks product to configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative),
              Workbench Associative Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip
              and configure later (using the CAD Configuration
                Manager). Solid EdgeIf you selected Solid Edge as one of your CAD products, you will have to choose
              which Solid Edge product to configure. You can choose the Reader (non-associative),
              Workbench Associative Interface (requires that the CAD product be installed), or skip
              and configure later (using the CAD Configuration
                Manager). 4.2.2. ANSYS License Manager InstallationBecause you will be using a network server, you must install
and configure the ANSYS, Inc. License Manager on the server machine.
The License Manager controls access to the ANSYS, Inc. products you
have purchased. On the server machine, navigate to the directory where
the installation packages reside. Right-click the setup.exe file and select Run as administrator.

              Next arrow.Note:  You are unable to change the installation directory for
a computer that currently contains an instance of the ANSYS, Inc.
License Manager or ANSYS Electromagnetics License Manager. To change
the installation directory location, you must first uninstall any
previous versions of both products.The ANSYS, Inc. License Manager is selected as the only product available to install. As with
            the product installation, the required and available disk space numbers are shown. Click
            the Next arrow.A summary screen appears that lists the products to be
installed. Because this is a license manager installation, the ANSYS,
Inc. License Manager is the only product listed.Click Next. The license manager installation begins.After the License Manager installation has been completed, the Launch License Management Center upon exiting option is
included on the screen. The ANSYS License Management Center is a browser-based user interface that centralizes many of the ANSYS

7.1. Installing ANSYS, Inc. Products7.1. Installing ANSYS, Inc. ProductsThis section explains how to install ANSYS, Inc. products. ANSYS, Inc. requires that you have full administrative privileges when installing any software
   on Microsoft Windows 7,Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Non-administrative accounts do not usually have
   the permissions required to access system areas that installation programs often need to modify.
   “Full administrative privileges” means that you are running as administrator with UAC
   turned off, or you are running as administrator with UAC turned on and Run as
    Administrator selected. Because of changes to the UAC functionality, it is
   necessary that you right-click and select Run as Administrator
   from the context menu when installing to Windows 8.1.Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 use a feature called User Account Control (UAC) to
   control privileges and automatically reduce the potential of security breaches in the operation
   system. However, UAC limits your accessibility to system areas and can cause unpredictable
   behavior in ANSYS, Inc. products, as noted below.7.1.1. Silent Mode OperationsANSYS, Inc. supports silent mode operations, including installation,
configuring/unconfiguring, and uninstalling. You can specify the following product flags. These flags are
all valid for a silent install. However, because of the way the products
are packaged, not all of these flags may be valid for a silent configuration/unconfiguration
or uninstall. Not all products are available on all platforms.For silent mode operations, if you do not specify any product
arguments, all available products will be installed, configured, or
uninstalled. Product FlagsProductproduct_flagMechanical APDL-mechapdlANSYS Customization

the ANSYS, Inc. License Manager, affecting other users who are using
that license server machine. You can deploy an ANSYS, Inc. product installation in silent
mode. The general form to run a silent product installation, including
the client licensing, from the Start>Run menu is:setup.exe -silent -product_flag Note:  In Windows 8.1 and 10 it is necessary to run silent commands from an administrator
       prompt. To access a Run as Administrator command prompt, click Start
        Screen> All apps> right-click the Command Prompt Icon> select Run as
        Administrator.The above form will install the products specified (see the
list of product_flags above).  Additional
command line arguments are available; please see the list below. For example, to install TurboGrid and Icepak to the default
installation directory, issue the following command:setup.exe -silent -install_dir “C:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc” -turbogrid -icepakTo install the ANSYS License Manager on Windows systems that
will act as license servers, you must run the setupLM.exe:setupLM.exe -silentThe silent license manager installation is valid only for the
default Licensing Configuration option "Run the ANSYS Licensing Interconnect
with FLEXlm." Please see Installing the ANSYS License Manager of the ANSYS, Inc. Licensing Guide for more information.If you are installing the license manager to a non-default installation directory, you can use
     the silent installation method, but only for the initial installation. To change the license
     manager installation directory for future installations, you will need to uninstall the license
     manager before reinstalling to a different directory.You can use the following arguments when running a silent installation:-silentInitiates
a silent installation.-install_dir "path"Specifies the directory to which the product is to
be installed.  For the installation directory, you must enclose the
path in quotes if you have spaces in the pathname. If you want the
product to install to the default location, you can omit the -install_dir argument. The default location is <os drive>:\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\. -product_flag Specifies one or more products to install.  If you omit the -product_flag argument, all products
will be installed. See the list of valid product_flags above.-productfile "path"You can specify an options file that lists the products
you want to install.  To do so, you must provide a full path to a
file containing desired products.  See Specifying Products with an Options
File for more details.-disablerssDisables automatic
internet feeds to ANSYS, Inc. products.-caspolAllows the .NET binaries that are
located under the \ANSYS Inc directory on the
shared machine to be run from the network. You must have administrative
privileges to modify the security policy. Use this option when you
specify a network location as the installation directory. To understand
the implications of this security exception for .NET, please contact
your system administrator or see Microsoft’s website http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7c9c2y1w(v=vs.80).aspx.-helpDisplays
a list of valid arguments for a silent installation.-licfilepath  "path"Specifies the location of the license file to install.
If the path is not specified or if the path is the same as the existing
license file, the license file will not be installed. Valid only when
doing a silent license manager installation (setupLM.exe).-setliclang languageSpecifies a language to use
for the server ANSLIC_ADMIN utility
and the ANSYS, Inc. Licensing Interconnect log file. Use the language
directory name in the language subdirectory of the licensing directory
(en-us, fr, de, etc.) as the language value. This flag
can be used during a GUI installation as well. Valid only when doing
a license manager installation (setupLM.exe).-licserverinfoSpecifies
information to be used by the client for the license server.  Valid
only in conjunction with a silent installation (setup.exe).  The format is:Single license server:LI port number:FLEXlm port number:hostnameExample:2325:1055:abcThree license servers:LI port number:FLEXlm port number:hostname1,hostname2,hostname3Example:“2325:1055:abc,def,xyz”The default
values for the Licensing Interconnect and FlexNet port numbers (2325 and
1055, respectively) will be used if they are not specified. However,
you do need to include the colons. In a three-server environment,
you also need to enclose the values in quotes (Windows only).Example:::abcor“::abc,def,xyz”Information specified via -licserverinfo will
be appended to existing information in the ansyslmd.ini file. To change information already in your ansyslmd.ini file, you must use the ANSLIC_ADMIN utility.-nohelpBy default, for the products that are being installed,
all help documentation is included. The -nohelp argument removes all help from the installation.-langSpecifies a language to
use for the products.The silent installation process will automatically close certain
applications, possibly resulting in lost data. You should always close
all programs before starting a silent install. A silent install will
first install any necessary prerequisites that are not already on
your system and then continue with the installation. You must have
administrative privileges to install prerequisites; if not, the silent
install will exit and write a message to the log file. Installation log files are located in the installation directory: install.log contains installation messages, and install_licconfig.log contains licensing installation
messages. In rare circumstances with a silent licensing installation,
the licensing installation messages may not be written to the install_licconfig.log (for example, if the silent licensing
installation aborts); in these cases, you may find error messages
in the .ansys_install_temp_licconfig_<user>_<index>.log file, located
in %TEMP%.For more information on the silent license manager installation,
see Installing the ANSYS License Manager of the ANSYS, Inc. Licensing Guide.Specifying Products with an Options
FileYou can also specify an options file on the command line using
the -productfile "path” option. The options file can specify which products you want to
install. The options file can contain all possible products, with
the products you do not want to install commented out, or it can contain
only the products you want to install. An example options file is
shown below. In the example, Creo Parametric and NX are
commented out using the acceptable comment indicators. When using
the options file, do not include the dash (-) before the product name.mechapdl

These prerequisites often require administrative permissions to install.
If you want to install as a non-administrative user but require prerequisites,
you can install the prerequisites separately by running InstallPreReqs.exe from the top level directory as an
administrator. You can also install the prerequisites silently using
the following command:InstallPreReqs.exe -silent 7.1.1.2. Silent Product Configuration/UnconfigurationYou can also run the ProductConfig.exe via
command line (i.e., silent mode) to configure or unconfigure products.
 From each client machine, run the ProductConfig.exe
-silent with the following options: -config, -unconfig, -prereqs, -caspol, and -product_flag. These options are described below.-config/-unconfig -- Use with the -silent option to indicate
that products should be configured/unconfigured. -prereqs -- Required to install the
necessary prerequisites on your system. Prerequisites must be installed
once on each machine.-caspol -- Required to modify the
necessary .NET security settings to allow the product to run across
the network. This option needs to be run once on each machine.-product_flag -- Use  to specify which products should be configured; see the
above list of product_flags. If you do
not specify one or more products, all products that have been installed
will be configured. Use the -help option for a list of
commands available for use with ProductConfig.exe.An example command for silent configuration is:"\\machineabc\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v170\ProductConfig.exe" -silent -prereqs
"\\machineabc\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v170\ProductConfig.exe" -silent -caspol
"\\machineabc\Program Files\ANSYS Inc\v170\ProductConfig.exe" -silent -configAll operations and error messages that are encountered while
using the silent product configuration/unconfiguration option are
written to the productConfig.txt file in the %TEMP% directory of the client machine. No log files are
written to the machine that is hosting ProductConfig.exe. 7.1.1.3. Silent Media InstallationTo run a silent installation from the media, you can either:Copy the contents of each DVD to a folder on the machine's
hard disk such that the 170-<number>.dvd files of each DVD are located
in the same directory. You can then proceed with the silent installation
as described earlier. Place all of the media in separate drives (any combination
of virtual ISO mounts or hardware drives) so that they can be accessed
simultaneously during the installation. Then run the silent installation
as described earlier, but include the additional -media_dir2
<path> option for each drive:setup.exe -silent -product_flag -media_dir2 <path>The installer uses the mount directory from which it was launched
as the first media path; you need to specify only the location of
the subsequent DVD(s) using the -media_dir2 option
shown in the example above.7.1.1.4. Silent UninstallTo run a silent uninstall, run the following from some location
other than the \v170 directory:C:\> <installation path>\v170\Uninstall.exe -silentThe silent uninstall will unconfigure and remove all products
and remove the entire \v170 directory,
including any user files or subdirectories that you have added to
the \v170 directory.Because of the way ANSYS, Inc. products are packaged, not all
of the product_flags shown above are valid.
To uninstall individual products, use the following product options
in conjunction with the -silent argument:Mechanical APDL-mechapdlANSYS Aqwa-aqwaANSYS CFX-cfxANSYS CFD-Post-cfdpostANSYS Fluent-fluentANSYS Polyflow-polyflowANSYS ICEM CFD-icemcfdANSYS TurboGrid-turbogridANSYS Icepak-icepakRemote Solve Manager Standalone Services-rsmFor example, to uninstall only TurboGrid and Icepak, issue
the following command:C:\> <installation path>\v170\Uninstall.exe -silent -turbogrid -icepakYou can also issue the -help option to see
a list of valid arguments for a silent uninstall.Uninstalling CFD-Post CFD-Post can be installed
as a standalone product.   As a standalone product, it is also automatically
installed with Fluent, Polyflow, and Icepak. To uninstall the
standalone version of CFD-Post, you must specify -cfdpost as well as all of the above products that you have installed.Note that CFD-Post is also installed with CFX; however,
you do not need to uninstall CFX to uninstall the standalone
version of CFD-Post, and uninstalling the standalone version of CFD-Post will
not remove the CFD-Post capability from CFX.Release 17.0 - © SAS IP, Inc. All rights reserved.

History[edit]




ANSYS, Inc. headquarters building in Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.


The company was founded in 1970. by John A. Swanson as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc (SASI). Its primary purpose was to develop and market finite element analysis software for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems. SASI developed its business in parallel with the growth in computer technology and engineering needs. The company grew by 10 percent to 20 percent each year, and in 1994 it was sold to TA Associates. The new owners took SASI's leading software, called ANSYS, as their flagship product and designated ANSYS, Inc. as the new company name.[citation needed]
Ansys was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1996. In 2011, Investor's Business Daily gave the firm a top score on its SmartSelect composite ratings.[5] The organization claims to reinvest 15 percent of its revenues each year into research to continually refine the software.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]
Ansys has acquired a number of companies since 2000, including ICEM CFD Engineering, Space-claim, CADOE S.A., of Lyon, France, a company specializing in parametric analysis, and with numerous French clients, including Michelin, Renault, Airbus, Areva and EDF,[7] and CFX (2003); Century Dynamics, Harvard Thermal, and Fluent Inc.

History[edit]




ANSYS, Inc. headquarters building in Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.


The company was founded in 1970. by John A. Swanson as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc (SASI). Its primary purpose was to develop and market finite element analysis software for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems. SASI developed its business in parallel with the growth in computer technology and engineering needs. The company grew by 10 percent to 20 percent each year, and in 1994 it was sold to TA Associates. The new owners took SASI's leading software, called ANSYS, as their flagship product and designated ANSYS, Inc. as the new company name.[citation needed]
Ansys was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1996. In 2011, Investor's Business Daily gave the firm a top score on its SmartSelect composite ratings.[5] The organization claims to reinvest 15 percent of its revenues each year into research to continually refine the software.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]
Ansys has acquired a number of companies since 2000, including ICEM CFD Engineering, Space-claim, CADOE S.A., of Lyon, France, a company specializing in parametric analysis, and with numerous French clients, including Michelin, Renault, Airbus, Areva and EDF,[7] and CFX (2003); Century Dynamics, Harvard Thermal, and Fluent Inc. (2006); Ansoft Corporation (2008); Apache Design Solutions (2011); Esterel Technologies (2012);[8] EVEN and Reaction Design (2013); Spaceclaim Corporation (2014) [9] and Newmerical Technologies International (2015).

PITTSBURGH and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ANSYS (NASDAQ:    ANSS) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:    SNPS) will enable customers to accelerate the next generation of high-performance computing, mobile and automotive products thanks to a new partnership that will tightly integrate ANSYS' power integrity and reliability signoff technologies with Synopsys' physical implementation solution for in-design usage.


Developers of innovative, cost-effective and reliable smart products need to quickly optimize, validate and signoff their designs. While designers have been using ANSYS and Synopsys tools in combination for years, the integrated solution will enable mutual customers to apply power integrity and reliability signoff technologies earlier in the design flow – empowering them to deliver innovative, high-performance and reliable products faster, while reducing power, area and cost.
The integration of ANSYS' industry-leading platform for chip power and reliability signoff, ANSYS® RedHawk™, with Synopsys' best-in-class place-and-route solutions, Synopsys IC Compiler™ II, will provide users earlier signoff accuracy within the Synopsys design environment. This integration will enable rapid design exploration, design weakness detection, optimization and thermal-aware reliability through increased functionality within the place-and-route environment. The in-design power integrity and reliability signoff-driven flow will eliminate late design changes and ensure consistency with final chip-package-system signoff analyses with RedHawk.
"This partnership is a continued step in Synopsys' strategy to bring more physical and signoff technologies earlier in the design flow within our Synopsys Digital Design Platform," said Sassine Ghazi, senior vice president and co-general manager, Design Group at Synopsys. "Partnering with ANSYS enables Synopsys to quickly deliver a reliability and thermal-driven design flow that is critical for designing the next generation of semiconductors."
Synopsys and ANSYS will also provide a feedback loop between the two-gold standard solutions, Synopsys PrimeTime® and ANSYS RedHawk. Voltage-aware timing analysis can be performed rapidly to avoid additional guard-banding and design margining. 
"As the industry moves to more and more complex chips, signoff-driven rail analysis needs to be available sooner in the physical design flow just like timing and design rule checking," said John Lee, general manager at ANSYS. "We believe partnering with Synopsys to bring our signoff technology into the Synopsys In-Design approach is the right way to accomplish this objective."
"TSMC collaborates with our EDA partners on silicon design solutions to enable our customers to achieve competitive performance, power and area for their next generation electronic products," said Suk Lee, TSMC senior director, Design Infrastructure Marketing Division. "This industry collaboration between Synopsys and ANSYS provides an opportunity for them to take the collaboration a step further by enabling reliability and thermal-driven physical design built on the industry's popular physical implementation and signoff solutions."
"ARM has been a long-time user of both Synopsys and ANSYS technologies, which have helped in the development of some of the most sophisticated CPU cores available in the market," said Hobson Bullman, vice president and general manager, TSG, ARM. "This announced partnership will enable our semiconductor partners to optimize our IP within their SoC designs earlier in the flow allowing more time to focus on reliable, robust and energy efficient designs."
"Both Synopsys and ANSYS have been strong collaboration partners with MediaTek to manage increasing manufacturing complexity and to deliver designs on schedule while realizing aggressive performance, power and area goals," said SA Hwang, general manager of Design Technology, MediaTek. "We believe this new partnership between Synopsys and ANSYS will enable MediaTek engineers to accelerate their pace of innovation while achieving further power, performance and area optimizations."
ANSYS and Synopsys will be featured at the Design Automation Conference in booth 647 and booth 147 respectively, from June 18-22 in Austin, Texas.

History[edit]




ANSYS, Inc. headquarters building in Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.


The company was founded in 1970. by John A. Swanson as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc (SASI). Its primary purpose was to develop and market finite element analysis software for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems. SASI developed its business in parallel with the growth in computer technology and engineering needs. The company grew by 10 percent to 20 percent each year, and in 1994 it was sold to TA Associates. The new owners took SASI's leading software, called ANSYS, as their flagship product and designated ANSYS, Inc. as the new company name.[citation needed]
Ansys was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1996. In 2011, Investor's Business Daily gave the firm a top score on its SmartSelect composite ratings.[5] The organization claims to reinvest 15 percent of its revenues each year into research to continually refine the software.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]
Ansys has acquired a number of companies since 2000, including ICEM CFD Engineering, Space-claim, CADOE S.A., of Lyon, France, a company specializing in parametric analysis, and with numerous French clients, including Michelin, Renault, Airbus, Areva and EDF,[7] and CFX (2003); Century Dynamics, Harvard Thermal, and Fluent Inc. (2006); Ansoft Corporation (2008); Apache Design Solutions (2011); Esterel Technologies (2012);[8] EVEN and Reaction Design (2013); Spaceclaim Corporation (2014) [9] and Newmerical Technologies International (2015).

History[edit]




ANSYS, Inc. headquarters building in Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.


The company was founded in 1970. by John A. Swanson as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc (SASI). Its primary purpose was to develop and market finite element analysis software for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems. SASI developed its business in parallel with the growth in computer technology and engineering needs. The company grew by 10 percent to 20 percent each year, and in 1994 it was sold to TA Associates. The new owners took SASI's leading software, called ANSYS, as their flagship product and designated ANSYS, Inc. as the new company name.[citation needed]
Ansys was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1996. In 2011, Investor's Business Daily gave the firm a top score on its SmartSelect composite ratings.[5] The organization claims to reinvest 15 percent of its revenues each year into research to continually refine the software.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]
Ansys has acquired a number of companies since 2000, including ICEM CFD Engineering, Space-claim, CADOE S.A., of Lyon, France, a company specializing in parametric analysis, and with numerous French clients, including Michelin, Renault, Airbus, Areva and EDF,[7] and CFX (2003); Century Dynamics, Harvard Thermal, and Fluent Inc. (2006); Ansoft Corporation (2008); Apache Design Solutions (2011); Esterel Technologies (2012);[8] EVEN and Reaction Design (2013); Spaceclaim Corporation (2014) [9] and Newmerical Technologies International (2015).

History[edit]




ANSYS, Inc. headquarters building in Cecil Township, Pennsylvania.


The company was founded in 1970. by John A. Swanson as Swanson Analysis Systems, Inc (SASI). Its primary purpose was to develop and market finite element analysis software for structural physics that could simulate static (stationary), dynamic (moving) and thermal (heat transfer) problems. SASI developed its business in parallel with the growth in computer technology and engineering needs. The company grew by 10 percent to 20 percent each year, and in 1994 it was sold to TA Associates. The new owners took SASI's leading software, called ANSYS, as their flagship product and designated ANSYS, Inc. as the new company name.[citation needed]
Ansys was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 1996. In 2011, Investor's Business Daily gave the firm a top score on its SmartSelect composite ratings.[5] The organization claims to reinvest 15 percent of its revenues each year into research to continually refine the software.[6]
Acquisitions[edit]
Ansys has acquired a number of companies since 2000, including ICEM CFD Engineering, Space-claim, CADOE S.A., of Lyon, France, a company specializing in parametric analysis, and with numerous French clients, including Michelin, Renault, Airbus, Areva and EDF,[7] and CFX (2003); Century Dynamics, Harvard Thermal, and Fluent Inc. (2006); Ansoft Corporation (2008); Apache Design Solutions (2011); Esterel Technologies (2012);[8] EVEN and Reaction Design (2013); Spaceclaim Corporation (2014) [9] and Newmerical Technologies International (2015).

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
