The spark for LendingTree ignited after Doug experienced his own frustrations and complexities of getting his first mortgage. Doug thought consumers could be better served, and he asked himself, "Why not create a way for banks to compete for their customers' business instead of customers having to do all the legwork to find the best deals?"In 1996, Doug founded LendingTree which revolutionized how consumers shop for loans and how lenders could reach new customers. As a financial tech company, LendingTree has dedicated itself to empowering consumers to make better and more informed financial decisions by providing transparent options and resources. LendingTree provides loan comparison resources for multiple financial products including mortgage, refinance, personal loans, auto loans, business loans, student loans, and more.Before founding LendingTree, Doug worked as an auditor and consultant for PriceWaterhouseCoopers after receiving his Bachelor's degree from Bucknell University.ExperienceFounder, Chairman & CEOLendingTreeDecember 2007  –  Present (9 years 8 months)Co-FounderTykoon2010  –  Present (7 years)ChairmanRecyclebank2008  –  Present (9 years)President & Chief Operating OfficerIACJanuary 2005  –  December 2007 (3 years)Founder & CEOLendingTreeJanuary 1996  –  December 2003 (8 years)Auditor & ConsultantPrice Waterhouse CoopersJanuary 1992  –  December 1996 (5 years)SkillsCEOsStart-upsUser ExperienceMarketing StrategyStrategic PartnershipsAnalyticsCorporate DevelopmentLead GenerationBusiness DevelopmentProduct ManagementStrategyVenture CapitalExecutive ManagementManagementE-commerceSee 12+Business StrategyEntrepreneurshipDigital MediaSEODirect MarketingDigital MarketingOnline AdvertisingNew Business DevelopmentMergers & AcquisitionsCompetitive AnalysisSEMOnline MarketingSee lessHow's this translation?Great•Has errorsThanks for your help!EducationUniversity of Virginia Darden School of BusinessMaster of Business Administration (MBA)Master of Business Administration (MBA)2012  –  2014University of Virginia Darden School of Business1996  –  1997Bucknell UniversityBA, Business AdministrationBA, Business Administration1988  –  1992View Doug’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Doug directlyView Doug’s Full ProfileNot the Doug you’re looking for?

Mr. Lebda, 43, is the chairman and chief executive of Tree.com, a public company based in Charlotte, N.C., and the parent of LendingTree.com, an online marketplace that matches mortgage borrowers with lenders.Mr. Lebda started LendingTree in 1996, and in 2003 it was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp. LendingTree was spun off by IAC five years later under the corporate name Tree.com. Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINOQ. LendingTree grew out of your own frustration with mortgage shopping. A. So in 1994 I bought a condo in Pittsburgh. I opened up the newspaper, looked at interest rates and picked a bank that had the lowest rate. I walked down to the bank branch and applied for a loan. Sure enough, the rate in the paper wasn’t the rate they offered me. I tried to comparison shop, and, of course, I had to walk to another bank branch.

I thought: Why can’t you have banks compete for business and create a marketplace the same way as you can for anything else? I founded the company because I felt that the banks had control over me in this process and I felt very disempowered through the whole thing. I think consumers still feel that way.

Q. What was the genesis of the “Tree” name? A. Before LendingTree the company was named Credit Source for a very brief time. On the eve of closing my very first financing, I got a letter from a major financial services firm, who will remain unnamed, saying they have the name “Credit Source” and you can’t use it.We went through a naming exercise with an agency. We brainstormed hundreds of names before choosing LendingTree. Some of them were just horrible. I remember one of them was Loan-Ranger. I was first going down the path of something related to “exchange,” like Loan-Ex. At one point we had the name Lend-Ex.Q. Which was the first lender to sign up? A. It was PNC, then National City.Today we have over 300 lenders — not all the big ones are on there all the time.Q. How much do lenders pay LendingTree to facilitate deals? A. They pay us a fee for every borrower we introduce them to, and that will vary. It’ll be as low as a couple of dollars to as high as over $100.

Q. Are 30-year fixed-rate loans still the most popular mortgage product? A. That still seems to be the trend.Q. What is your assessment of the lending market right now? A. As refinancing is slowing down, banks need more volume and so they look to people like us to give them volume. Underwriting standards are starting to loosen a little bit.Q. How so? A. It really involves the credit score, loan-to-value ratio and debt-to-income ratio. Lowering the credit score, allowing higher debt-to-income ratios and higher loan-to-values.

Q. Where do you see the company in the next few years? A. The Internet has made it easier to shop for prices, but it’s almost made it more confusing, not less. We find that most consumers don’t comparison shop for a mortgage.We want to demystify that. Through new tools and improvements in our technology and in our processes, we want to make it so everybody can have an account on LendingTree — whether you’re a customer or not. We want to make the tools and the calculators easy to use, save scenarios, and figure out what you can afford.We just launched a rate table product. We’re launching something called the best loan for life in the middle of this year, which will enable you to never have to guess again whether you should refinance. We’ll simply monitor your credit, we’ll monitor your home value, we’ll let you set a goal and when the goal is achieved — whether it’s a savings goal or shortening your payment or term or reducing your payment — we will essentially introduce you to a lender to do that deal.We’re also launching something called the Lender Directory — like a TripAdvisor for the mortgage industry. For loan officers or mortgage brokers there will be a page on LendingTree where their customers can rate them and review them.Q. What about mobile users? A. We’re redoing our mobile site right now to make it better. We have not done any apps yet. We have one small rate-finder app that hasn’t gotten a lot of traction. That’s something else we expect to address this year. The best mobile applications are ones that actually need to be location-dependent. Shopping for homes, for example, is a great mobile app; figuring out a restaurant is a great mobile app while you’re on the go. Things where you need to get alerted are good mobile apps. Filling out a mortgage form? Not so much.Q. So are you still doing Ironman triathlons? A. I did Kona two years ago and switched to ultramarathons. Running is a great time to think and just relax.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

LendingTree is an online lending exchange that connects consumers with multiple lenders, banks, and credit partners who compete for business. LendingTree is not a direct supplier of loans; it is instead a broker. Since being founded in 1998 LendingTree has facilitated more than 32 million loan requests[citation needed]. It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
LendingTree also provides financing tools, comparative loan searches and borrowing information.[2]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
After graduating from Bucknell University, Doug Lebda went to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Pittsburgh as an auditor and consultant. When he decided to purchase his first home and obtain a mortgage, he found the process of visiting multiple banks and combing through mortgage offers frustrating, time consuming, and exhausting. Lebda realized that if the process was that difficult for someone with his financial acumen, then there must be a massive market of others with the same desire for a better way. With this idea, Doug founded CreditSource USA in 1996 with Jamey Bennett, whom he knew from Bucknell and had previous experience founding BookWire. The new company was later rebranded as LendingTree and by 1998, LendingTree launched nationally online with its headquarters in Charlotte, NC.[3]
Growth[edit]
LendingTree went through a successful IPO on February 15, 2000. Bennett would leave LendingTree after the IPO.
In May 2003, LendingTree, LLC was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, former owner of Ticketmaster, Home Shopping Network and current owner of Match.com. In 2004, LendingTree acquired HomeLoanCenter.com and formed LendingTree Loans.[citation needed]
After 5 years, LendingTree spun off from IAC to join newly established Tree.com, Inc. Tree.com is now the parent company of several brands and businesses in the financial services and real estate industries including LendingTree.com; GetSmart.com; DegreeTree.com; LendingTreeAutos.com; and DoneRight.com.[4]
In 2015 LendingTree disassembled the Tree.com umbrella to focus on its core brand, LendingTree which now incorporates Business Loans, Personal Loans, Debt Consolidation, Free Credit Scores, and Student Loans along with its core mortgage products Home Loans, Mortgage Refinance, and Home Equity.[5]
