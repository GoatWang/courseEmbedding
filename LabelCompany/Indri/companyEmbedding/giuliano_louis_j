2/26/2001

Â·        ITT Industriesâ? President Lou Giuliano to succeed Travis Engen
Â·        Engen Moving to Alcan Inc. of Canada as President and Chief Executive Officer
White Plains, New York â? February 26, 2001 -- ITT Industries, Inc. (NYSE: ITT) today announced that the companyâ?s Board of Directors has elected Louis J. Giuliano to the position of Chairman, President and Chief Executive.  He succeeds Travis Engen, who is leaving the company to accept the role of President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcan Inc., an aluminum and packaging company based in Montreal, Canada.  Giuliano will assume his new role on March 1.  Engen will remain on the ITT Industriesâ? Board of Directors through the completion of his term in May.
 
â?Travis Engen has done an exceptional job in leading our company in its first five years as an independent entity,â said Giuliano.  â?I am very enthusiastic about assuming that leadership role, building on the strong foundation that Travis and our management team have developed.  ITT Industries has been transformed in dramatic ways.  The company is now well positioned in a number of attractive global markets.  I am confident that with our outstanding management team, we can continue to build upon the proven track record we have established in the last few years.â
 
 
 
Engen will assume his new position at Alcan on March 12.  â?The decision to leave was not easy,â said Engen.  â?But it was made easier by the companyâ?s strong position and the confidence I have in Lou Giuliano and the entire management team at ITT Industries.  Iâ?m proud of what we have accomplished these last few years and I believe the company has excellent prospects going forward.  Lou and I have worked together for twenty two years, and I know heâ?ll do an outstanding job.â
 
Giuliano, 54, joined ITT in July 1988 as vice president of defense operations at ITT Defense after a 19-year career at Allied-Signal.  He served as President and Chief Executive of ITT Industriesâ? Defense and Electronics businesses and Senior Vice President of ITT Industries for eight years.   During that time, the unitâ?s businesses entered new, rapidly growing markets and realized consistent sales and margin improvements. 
 
Giuliano was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ITT Industries, Inc. in October 1998.  In this role, he has been responsible for the ongoing operations at the company and has played a key role in improving the companyâ?s operating performance leading to stronger margins and higher cash flow.  Most recently he has led the companyâ?s Value Based Six Sigma introduction, a program designed to streamline processes and increase operating effectiveness throughout the company.
 
Giuliano is a graduate of Syracuse University with a Bachelor of Science Degree in chemistry, and a Master of Business Administration in marketing.

Methodology:
Rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year. Efficiency grade is based on our chief executive's pay/performance score. We gave an "A+" to the most efficient boss in delivering performance/pay and "F" for the least efficient. Grades are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and six-year compensation history.

Footnotes:
Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based on Apr. 2, 2004 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on combined salary and bonus. Annualized total return during tenure covers the tenure of the executive or from the time of the IPO or available stock history. Relative to market is the ending value of $100 invested in the stock, divided by the ending value of $1 invested in the market. NA: Not available or not applicable. NM: Not meaningful. 1Annualized salary. 2Paid to date. 3Four-year total. 4Three-year total. 5Less than 0.01%. 6Annualized bonus. 7Prior-year data. 8New chief executive; compensation may be for another executive office. 9Less than $100,000. 10Received options or restricted stock in lieu of portion of salary. 11Received options or restricted stock in lieu of portion of bonus. 12Includes shares indirectly held.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
