Dana and Sue Anderson make $1.4 million gift for new KU School of Business building
Thursday, February 14, 2013


Dana and Sue Anderson, of Los Angeles, have made a $1.4 million gift toward construction of new School of Business at the University of Kansas. This brings contributions by KU alumni and friends for the new building to more than $33 million. 
	Dana Anderson earned a bachelor’s degree in business from KU in 1959. He is vice-chair of the board of directors of Macerich, of Los Angeles. The Andersons have contributed to numerous projects at KU, including the Anderson family Business Opportunity Fund, the Anderson Family Football Complex and Strength Conditioning Center, and the Wagnon Student Center. Anderson received the Ellsworth Medallion in 1998 for his service to KU.
	“Sue and I have been extremely impressed by Dean Neeli Bendapudi’s leadership,” said Anderson. “She has energized the entire community associated with the School of Business. We hope our gift will help her address the dire need for a new building, giving KU the facility it deserves. 
	“It is critical that the school’s alumni and friends help make this project a reality,” said Anderson. “We have the ability during this campaign to secure the legacy of a quality education for the next generation of KU students.”
	Bendapudi said the creation of a new building will advance the KU School of Business. “I am excited to see the support for this project,” she said. “It is worth noting that a significant portion of these donations were made by members of the school’s advisory board, of which Dana Anderson is a longtime member.”
	KU Endowment is working with alumni and friends to complete private funding for the building, which is expected to cost approximately $60 million. The six-story, 166,000-square-foot building will be located on the east side of Naismith Drive, across from Allen Fieldhouse at the south entrance of the campus.
	The gifts count toward Far Above: The Campaign for Kansas, the university’s $1.2 billion comprehensive fundraising campaign. Far Above seeks to educate future leaders, advance medicine, accelerate discovery and drive economic growth to seize the opportunities of the future.
	The campaign is managed by KU Endowment, the independent, nonprofit organization serving as the official fundraising and fund-management organization for KU. Founded in 1891, KU Endowment was the first foundation of its kind at a U.S. public university.
