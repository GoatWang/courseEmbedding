What Our Customers Have to Say




 I have had the pleasure of working on several recent projects with All Marketing Solutions. They have delivered great work on our custom WordPress, Genesis and Woocommerce websites. We generally have tight timelines and complex requests and they always do their best to accommodate the timelines, trouble shooting and provide workable solutions. I would recommend working with this team as their experience and expertise have added great value to every project they work on.
All Marketing Solutions built an excellent Facebook application for one of my clients that attracted new fans and improved revenue. The creative and technical work was top draw and the project was delivered on time and on budget. Communications was excellent and head and shoulders above any outsourcers I’ve worked with on similar projects. I’d be happy to recommend the All Marketing Solutions to team anyone looking for high quality products.
All Marketing Solutions team has been very reliable, which is rare these days, and has delivered exactly what the project required. I appreciated the flexibility and quick turnaround time in terms of little fixes and last minute edits -they have been quite resourceful and able to come up with a right solution every single time. And because of that I would definitely recommend them for any WordPress/Genesis development work and will work with them in the future when the need arises too.
We have worked Ijaz and his team for almost a year now and think they are fantastic! Their ability to create EXACTLY what we need is a very special skill, as they have done some wonderful projects for us so far! They have turned out designs into pixel-perfect creations and we really feel this is a long-term relationship. What they don’t know about Genesis and WordPress is not worth knowing. Thanks, team!!
Ijaz and his team did an amazing job on an intricate, custom designed WordPress Genesis framework. They answered all my questions, met all my requests (and I had quite a few!), and then the biggest part, have even helped make changes and tweaks after the job was complete.
They are committed partners who will make sure your job is complete even after it’s completed. I would definitely recommend them to my friends.

	PART I








	Item 1. Business.



	All Marketing Solutions, Inc. (

	

	All Marketing Solutions

	

	,

	

	we

	

	,

	

	the Company

	

	) was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on December 17, 2008 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. We are a development-stage Company formed in order to enter into the international market for patent consulting and technology transfer services.


	The Company business model is to assist small business and entrepreneurs that have developed patentable novel products or services but does not have the financial resources to fund their own patent application. The Company will take an equity position in the product and pay for the patent application on behalf of the inventor. The patents will be applied listing both the inventor and the Company as co-patent holders. The estimated cost of a US patent application is between $20,000 and $30,000 US. The Company does not intend to market any of the products it accepts for patent application, once a patent pending has been issued it is the company

	

	s intent to sell the patent application to an individual or Company who already operates within the same industry. The Company will negotiate with each inventor on the Company

	

	s equity share but the Company

	

	s standard offer will be 50% ownership in the invention.  If the Company is successful in taking an equity position, it will provide the funds for making the patent application, use its knowledge and expertise in arranging the filing of the patent application, and it will sell the patent.  All of these efforts will be the Company

	

	s alone, with no participation or efforts of any other party. The Company will use the Internet to markets services as well and attend some tradeshows that are specific to inventors and entrepreneurs such as INPEX the largest such trade show in the United States.





	In January of 2014 the Company expanded its business model to identify entrepreneurs or companies with emerging technologies that are potentially patentable and at a stage where funding and/or marketing and management expertise is required; first to protect these technologies and second to take advantage of the opportunity they afford the target market. The Company is interested in evaluating both product and service technologies, which technologies meet the Company

	

	s objectives. Upon successful completion of due diligence, the Company

	

	s intention is to acquire or partner with these entrepreneurs or companies.





	Early in 2014, the Company announced OneBigDrive. Customers downloading OneBigDrive were provided with an easy-to-use one-stop solution for consolidating multiple free cloud storage accounts into one. OneBigDrive would consolidate 32 gigabytes of free cloud storage provided by Box, Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.





	On May 12, 2014, the Company announced that its OneBigDrive application is now integrated with Box.com, consolidating more free storage for OneBigDrive customers and enabling Box.com customers the ability to utilize OneBigDrive

	

	s technology.





	On February 15, 2015 the Company announced it was in the final stages of hubiC testing for cloud storage services. Once fully integrated, All Marketing Solutions announced that the minimum consolidation capability would raise by 25GB. In addition, the Company announced in February that it was changing its product name

	

	OneBigDrive

	

	to

	

	Cloudz

	

	.





	Coudz is available to customers by downloading the software from the Company

	

	s web site. Cloudz will operate on Windows, Mac OSx, IOs and Android.


	 


	Since December 17, 2008 (inception) through December 31, 2015 the Company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of $1,358,808.

	Our auditor

	

	s report on our December 31, 2015 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our officer and director may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See

	

	December 31, 2015 Audited Financial Statements - Auditors Report.

	



	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources






	As of December 31, 2015, All Marketing Solutions had $Nil cash on hand and in the bank, and $626 of cash on hand and in the bank as of December 31, 2014. Management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees - by additional equity financing. This will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock.





	Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.





	If All Marketing Solutions is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in All Marketing Solutions having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because All Marketing Solutions is a development stage company with no








	revenue to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If All Marketing Solutions cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in All Marketing Solutions common stock would lose all of their investment.









	Results of Operations






	Since December 17, 2008 (inception) through December 31, 2015, the Company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of $1,358,808. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of $17,999 and a net loss of and $17,999 as compared to operating expenses of $1,252,435 and a net loss of $1,252,435 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 is a result of Impairment of fixed asset expense of $Nil, Office and general expense of $4,499 comprised primarily of web site maintenance fees, filing fees and Transfer fees, Professional Fees of $13,500 comprised primarily of accounting fees, related party expense of $Nil. This compares to the net loss for the period ended December 31, 2014 of $1,252,435 which was a result of Impairment of fixed asset expense of $1,000,000, Office and general expense of $237,435 comprised primarily of Software development fees web site maintenance fees filing fees and Transfer fees, Professional Fees of $9,000 comprised primarily of accounting fees, related party expense of $6,000 comprised primarily of accounting expense.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.






	As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to establish the Company and begin operations is estimated to be $120,000 over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be $7,000 over this same period. The officer and director during this period, Nikola Pizurica, has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain the Company

	

	s business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement.  Management believes that if the Company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company.  As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.    





	Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.






	Going Consideration Consideration



	 


	Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.







	Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.






	We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 


	 




	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of






	All Marketing Solutions, Inc.




	 


	 



	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of All Marketing Solutions, Inc. as of December 31, 2014, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2014. All Marketing Solutions management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.



	 



	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



	 



	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of All Marketing Solutions, Inc as of December 31, 2014, and the related statements of income, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2014.



	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has no revenues, has negative working capital at December 31, 2014, has incurred recurring losses and recurring negative cash flow from operating activities, and has an accumulated deficit which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.  Managements plans concerning these matters are also described in Note 3.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS







	December 31, 2015








	NOTE 1

	

	NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION







	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on December 17, 2008 and established a fiscal year end of December 31. It intends to seek business opportunities in the patent consulting and technology transfer and commercialization industries, specializing in financing and facilitating the patent application process for individual inventors and organizations that lack the financial resources to do so on their own.







	NOTE 2

	

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation



	The financial statements present the balance sheet, statements of operations, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows of the Company. These financial statements are presented in United States dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.






	Advertising



	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2015, no advertising costs have been incurred.






	Research and Development



	Research and Development costs are expensed as incurred.  As of December 31, 2015, no costs have been incurred.






	Property



	The Company does not own or rent any property.  The office space is provided by the president at no charge.






	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Income Taxes



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of enactment or substantive enactment.  






	Revenue and Cost Recognition



	The Company has no current source of revenue; therefore the Company has not yet adopted any policy regarding the recognition of revenue or cost.






	Net Loss per Share



	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential








	dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company.  Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The company has evaluated all the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company

	

	s financial statement.





	FASB issues various Accounting Standards Updates relating to the treatment and recording of certain accounting transactions.  On June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) - Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation, which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) entirely from current accounting guidance.  The Company has elected adoption of this standard, which eliminates the designation of DSEs and the requirement to disclose results of operations and cash flows since inception.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments include cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable on demand.







	NOTE 3

	

	GOING CONCERN







	The Company

	

	s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company has a working capital deficit of $293,488, an accumulated deficit of $1,358,808 and net loss from operations since inception of $1,358,808. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern.  The Company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder

	

	s shares.





	The officers and directors have committed to advancing certain operating costs of the Company, including Legal, Audit, Transfer Agency and Edgarizing costs







	NOTE 4

	

	CAPITAL STOCK







	The Company

	

	s capitalization is 200,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.001 per share.  No preferred shares have been authorized or issued.





	On September 30, 2009, the President was issued 2,280,000,000 common shares for $9,500 cash, which was received on October 8, 2009.





	In March, 2012 the Company issued 40,560,000 common shares for cash of $5,070.





	On February 5, 2013 the Company approved that the 75,000,000 authorized common shares be increased to 200,000,000 authorized common shares





	On February 6, 2013 the Company redeemed 2,220,000,000 common shares (9,250,000 pre-split) for $10 cash. This resulted in a reduction in the Accumulated Deficit of $9,240. The stock was cancelled.











	On January 8, 2014, the Company issued 4,000,000 common shares in exchange for a capital acquisition, at $0.25 per share.





	On May 15, 2014, the Company issued 150,000 common shares for cash of $60,000.





	As of December 31, 2015, and as of December 31, 2014 104,710,000 common shares are issued and outstanding.







	NOTE 5

	

	LOAN PAYABLE

	

	RELATED PARTY LOANS







	The Company has received $113,600 as a loan from two different related parties. The loans are payable on demand and without interest.







	NOTE 6

	

	INCOME TAXES







	We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. We provided a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.


	The components of the Company

	

	s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of December 31, 2015 are as follows:

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.






	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Company

	

	s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company

	

	s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company

	

	s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.





	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company

	

	s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015.






	Management

	

	s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	The matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Company

	

	s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Company's Chief Financial Officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and communicated the matters to our management.





	Management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an affect on the Company's financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Company's determination to its financial statements for the future years.


	 


	We are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.





	Management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Company's Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.





	We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.











	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the company

	

	s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management

	

	s report was not subject to attestation by the company

	

	s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management

	

	s report in this annual report.





	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuer's last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.









	Item 9B. Other Information.



	None








	PART III








	Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This interim report contains forward looking statements relating to our Company's future economic performance, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to, our management. The words "expects", "intends", "believes", "anticipates", "may", "could", "should" and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement.  Our auditor's report on our December 31, 2015 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. Since our officer and director may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital, we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans. See "December 31, 2015 Audited Financial Statements - Auditors Report."  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of December 31, 2015, All Marketing Solutions had $Nil cash on hand and in the bank, and $626 of cash on hand and in the bank as of December 31, 2014. Management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees - by additional equity financing. This will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock.  Management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful, we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof. However, additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.  If All Marketing Solutions is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure. Therefore, the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in All Marketing Solutions having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to the company. However, if such financing were available, because All Marketing Solutions is a development stage company with no  revenue to date, it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load. If All Marketing Solutions cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations. As a result, investors in All Marketing Solutions common stock would lose all of their investment.  Results of Operations  Since December 17, 2008 (inception) through December 31, 2015, the Company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of $1,358,808. For fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred operating expenses in the amount of $17,999 and a net loss of and $17,999 as compared to operating expenses of $1,252,435 and a net loss of $1,252,435 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 is a result of Impairment of fixed asset expense of $Nil, Office and general expense of $4,499 comprised primarily of web site maintenance fees, filing fees and Transfer fees, Professional Fees of $13,500 comprised primarily of accounting fees, related party expense of $Nil. This compares to the net loss for the period ended December 31, 2014 of $1,252,435 which was a result of Impairment of fixed asset expense of $1,000,000, Office and general expense of $237,435 comprised primarily of Software development fees web site maintenance fees filing fees and Transfer fees, Professional Fees of $9,000 comprised primarily of accounting fees, related party expense of $6,000 comprised primarily of accounting expense.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements.  As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to establish the Company and begin operations is estimated to be $120,000 over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be $7,000 over this same period. The officer and director during this period, Nikola Pizurica, has undertaken to provide the Company with operating capital to sustain the Company's business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a non-secured loan. However, there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement. Management believes that if the Company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.  Other than the above described situation the Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  Going Consideration Consideration  Our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph in their report on the accompanying financial statements regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent auditors. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
