On February 26, 2016, the Bancorp announced that Mr. Bochnowski will assume the position of Chief Executive Officer of the Bancorp and the Bank upon David Bochnowski's retirement as CEO on April 28, 2016. He joined the Bancorp in 2010, where he became Senior Vice President, Strategy and Risk, and had bank-wide responsibility for project management, strategic planning and enterprise risk management, and became Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Bancorp in 2013. When the decision was made to nominate him as a director of the Bancorp, the Board concluded that his vision, talent, and passion for community banking along with his proven track record of performance would make him a valuable addition to the Board. The Board believes that he will uphold the Bancorp's ongoing commitment to help consumers and small business owners throughout Northwest Indiana achieve their financial goals.
