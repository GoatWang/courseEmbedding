John Fitzgerald Biagas
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Maryland:













Does John Fitzgerald Biagas carry a valid contracting license?



Maryland laws protect consumers by requiring home improvement contractors to hold a current license issued by the Maryland Home Improvement Commission.
John Fitzgerald Biagas currently holds license 3929 (Landscape Architects), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Maryland?



The Maryland Home Improvement Commission maintains high standards for home improvement contractor licensing. Applicants must provide proof of at least two years of experience or education in their given field and pass a board exam prior to receiving their license.











Your liability risk when hiring John Fitzgerald Biagas



Licensed contractors in Maryland are required to show proof of $50,000 liability insurance in order to obtain their license.











Financial recourse when hiring John Fitzgerald Biagas



If you hire a licensed contractor in Maryland, you are protected by the State's Home Improvement Guaranty Fund. This fund is administered by the Home Improvement Commission to compensate homeowners who suffer economic damages at the hands of a licensed home improvement contractor. No coverage is provided to the homeowner if the contractor is not properly licensed. 











What else should I know before hiring John Fitzgerald Biagas



Licensed contractors in Maryland must provide proof of financial solvency based on the scope and size of their business in relation to total assets, liabilities, credit rating, and net worth.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Maryland Home Improvement Commission recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
