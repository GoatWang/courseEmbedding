As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.

Best brands of solar panels
To find the best brands of solar panels you can use America's most trusterd solar panel comparison and reviews website, SolarReviews.
However, reviews of solar panels can be a bit meaningless because most consumer owners have not had any issues and so whilst solar company reviews are very important when choosing solar installers they are of less use when choosing solar panels.
For more information to help you make an informed decision about this topic, I would recommend this article about buying solar panels.

How much electricity will solar panels produce in California
Solar panels produce different amounts of energy in different locations.
Around the Sacramento area solar panels installed on a south facing 29 degree pitch roof will typically produce:
1,550 kWh per year per 1kw of peak DC (direct current) capacity
For more information about how your location, roof direction and roof tilt affects solar power production use the solar panels calculator and enter your address below.









What rebates, solar tax credits and other solar incentives are available in California
What solar incentives and tax credits are available in California?
The main incentives to install solar in California is the 30% federal solar tax credit and the net metering law.
The upfront utility based incentives from each of the main publically owned utilities are now exhausted for residential customers and almost exhausted for commercial customers.
However, the investment case for buying solar panels for your home has never been stronger because reductions in the price of solar systems has more than compensated for the loss of some upfront rebates.
 

 
Net Metering in California
The California Public Utility Commission voted by a narrow majority of 3 to 2 to extend the ability of residential energy customers in California to be credited with full retail rates for excess solar power that they generate and feed back into the grid at times when the electrical loads in their house are less than their solar production.
Whilst this didn't affect people that had already had installed solar panels on their homes in California it was a massive win for the millions of Californian homeowners who are yet to install the solar panels.
The reason net metering law is so important is that solar systems by their nature produce most power in the middle of the day when most homeowners are at work and using little power.
This is a very generous incentive and should not be taken for granted.
It means you can now install solar panels and sign a contract with your utility (known as a net metering agreement) where the utility guarantees to pay you a retail rate for exported solar power, usually for 10 or 15 years.
Each of the major utilities may offer slightly different net metering contracts but they are similar in nature.
To see more visit www.cpuc.ca.gov/General.aspx?id=3800
 

 
Is a purchase, lease or PPA agreement best?
Generally speaking you will make the largest savings over time if you purchase your solar panels outright yourself (whether you use cash you have at hand or finance secured against your home).
 However this is not always the case.
If you are in a position where you do not have a federal income tax liability then you will not be able to take advantage of the 30% federal solar tax credit.
In this case you may be better off with a third party owned solar lease where the solar company retains the right to this tax credit.
 

 
What is the payback period from installing solar panels in California?
The payback period from installing solar panels in California is usually between 4 and 8 years depending on the size of the system, the brand of solar panels you buy, the amount you were previously paying for power and whether you lease or buy your system.
This represents an excellent low risk investment.
 

 
Why analysis of solar savings and payback periods can be difficult in California
As California has net metering then the value of a solar power system is simply the annual production multiplied by the rate for power.
However, working this out can be difficult for two reasons.
Firstly for people on time of use metering the value power value changes with the time of day that the solar power is generated.
The second issue relates to the tiered rates of power prices.
With most utilities the amount you are charged for power increases as your usage increases.

Andalay Solar, Inc. (USOTC:WEST)Historical Stock Chart
3 Years : From Jul 2014 to Jul 2017



FREMONT, Calif., June 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Andalay Solar, Inc., a leading supplier of integrated solar power systems announced that its Instant Connect® Module is compatible with power optimizers supplied by SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. ("SolarEdge") (NASDAQ: SEDG), a global leader in PV inverters, power optimizers, and module-level monitoring services. The SolarEdge module add-on power optimizer can now be snapped onto the Andalay module frame using Andalay's bracket. Andalay and SolarEdge have also agreed to work on developing DC Instant Connect®, a solution that will embed the power optimizer cables into the frame of the Andalay module to allow faster cable connection between modules with the intention of eliminating costly wire management issues. In addition to the plug and play wiring, the DC Instant Connect® rail-less module further simplifies installation since it has built-in racking and grounding.  
"SolarEdge is always seeking partners such as Andalay who have time and cost saving innovations in the critical balance-of-systems area within the U.S. rooftop solar market where we are seeing such high growth," said Peter Mathews, North America General Manager for SolarEdge. "When the Andalay system is combined with the SolarEdge power optimizer in a plug and play manner, we can see great benefits for labor savings and more reliable, repeatable installations."
"We believe working with SolarEdge strategically enhances our product portfolio and are very excited that SolarEdge has approved our Andalay technology for direct attachment of its power optimizer and will work with us to co-develop our Instant Connect product as being plug-and-play with the SolarEdge power optimizer," said Steven Chan, CEO of Andalay Solar. "We are seeing high demand for this integrated product which complements our AC Instant Connect Product and we believe that combining the Andalay and SolarEdge technologies will increase performance, mitigate power loss and make our systems even more reliable and easy to install."

As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.
