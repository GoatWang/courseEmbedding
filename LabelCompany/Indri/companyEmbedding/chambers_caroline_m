* Marked salary data appeared in the official records from the listed fiscal year even though it pertains to a different fiscal year.
            





Congressional staff salaries shown are the amount paid in the period shown. They are not annual salaries. Because bonuses may be included here and other payments may not be (most notably with aides working for multiple offices or for a political campaign committee), please use caution in extrapolating annual salaries from the figures shown here.

We have taken great care to have this website reflect the official record, but we have discovered a handful of errors both in the official record and our own transcription. If you believe our information is in error, please let us know so we can fix it as soon as possible. We take accuracy very seriously.

LegiStorm's salary data goes back to Oct. 1, 2000. We do not have information prior to this date.



        * To determine the annualized salary rate for each staffer based on this period of release, hover over the amount paid. The first number calculates an annualized rate of pay based solely on this particular record. The second number annualizes the staffer's salary based on all salary received by this chamber in this salary period. 
        Treat annualized salaries with caution.
        Payments may include one-time bonus amounts that could unduly inflate annual salary calculations. Some staff are part-time or interns, even though they may or may not be labeled as such, and their records are easy to misinterpret. Dates and salary payment amounts are from official sources, which can sometimes be wrong. Salaries paid during short time frames are particularly susceptible to error in extrapolating salaries. Payments are gross salary amounts and do not reflect take-home income after taxes.
