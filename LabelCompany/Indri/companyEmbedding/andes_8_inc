  NOTES
TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(UNAUDITED)

 

 

 




 



1.



DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS AND HISTORY




 

Description
of business . Andes 8,
Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of
the State of Delaware on July 27, 2015, and has been inactive since
inception. The Company intends to serve as a vehicle to affect an
asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other
business combination with a domestic or foreign
business.

 




 



2.



SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT POLICIES




 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have
been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission requirements for interim
financial statements. Therefore, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States for complete financial
statements. The financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements in our Form 10-K filed
February 1, 2016.

 

The
interim financial statements present the balance sheet, statements
of operations and cash flows for the Company. The financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

 

The
interim financial information is unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of
operations and cash flows presented herein have been included in
the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal and
recurring nature. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of
results of operations for the full year.

 

Use of
estimates . The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires the
Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. These
estimates and judgments are based on historical information,
information that is currently available to the Company and on
various other assumptions that the Company believes to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

 

Cash and
cash equivalents . Cash and
cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term investments with
original maturities of less than 90 days. Cash equivalents are
placed with high credit quality financial institutions and are
primarily in money market funds. The carrying value of those
investments approximates fair value.

 

Revenue
Recognition . Revenue
is only recognized when all of the following criteria are met:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered,
(3) the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and
(4) collectability is reasonably assured.

Earnings
(loss) per share . Basic
earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing income
available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of
shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to
include the number of additional shares of common stock that would
have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been
issued. There were no potentially dilutive securities outstanding
during the periods presented.

 

Stock-based
compensation . The
Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the
receipt of goods or services from other than employees in
accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) ASC 718-10, Compensation – Stock
Compensation, and the conclusions reached by FASB ASC 505-50,
Equity – Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Costs are
measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments
issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
instruments issued for consideration other than employee services
is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as
defined by FASB ASC 505-50.

 

Income
taxes . The
Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method,
whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to
operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Accounting standards
regarding income taxes requires a reduction of the carrying amounts
of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance, if based on the
available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets
will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation
allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting
period based on a more-likely-than-not realization threshold. This
assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency
and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future
profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the
Company’s experience with operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning
alternatives.

 

The
Company recorded valuation allowances on the net deferred tax
assets. Management will reassess the realization of deferred tax
assets based on the accounting standards for income taxes each
reporting period. To the extent that the financial results of
operations improve and it becomes more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets are realizable, the Company will be able to
reduce the valuation allowance.

 

Significant
judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax
positions and determining its provision for income taxes. During
the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
Accounting standards regarding uncertainty in income taxes provides
a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax
positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for
recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence
indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or
litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax
benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely, based
solely on the technical merits, of being sustained on examinations.
The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating
its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic
adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual
outcomes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements . The Company has evaluated
recent pronouncements through Accounting Standards Updates
(“ASU”) 2016-18 and believes that none of them will
have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

 




3.



GOING
CONCERN




 

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has incurred losses since inception and had accumulated
deficit of $28,401 as of September 30, 2016. The Company requires
capital for its contemplated operational activities. The
Company’s ability to raise additional capital through the
future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of
additional financing, the successful development of the
Company’s contemplated plan of operations, and its
transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations
are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability
to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about
the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The
financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments
that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned
uncertainties.

 

In order
to mitigate the risk related with this uncertainty, the Company
plans to issue additional shares of common stock for cash and
services during the next 12 months.

 




4.



STOCKHOLDERS’
EQUITY




 

Preferred
Stock . The
Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par
value preferred stock. As of September 30, 2016, no shares of
preferred stock had been issued.

 

Common
Stock  -
The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.0001
par value common stock. As of September 30, 2016, 20,000,000 shares
were issued and outstanding.

 

Upon
formation of the Company on July 27, 2015, the Board of Directors
issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock for $1,000 in services to
the founding shareholder of the Company. In addition, the founding
shareholder made a contribution of $1,000 to the Company for the
period ended June 30, 2016, which is recorded as additional paid-in
capital.

 

Subsequently,
and as previously reported on Form 8K, on September 12, 2016 the
Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with Dongzhi Zhang
for the purchase of 20 million shares of its restricted common
stock at a price of $0.0001 per share. The sale was the result of a
privately negotiated transaction without the use of public
dissemination of promotional or sales materials. Richard Chiang,
our then sole shareholder, officer and director, and the Company
agreed to the redemption of 10,000,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock at par value, i.e. $1,000, which had
previously been issued to Mr. Chiang.

If you like chocolate and mint together, you won't be sorry. They are very tasty and are usually eaten more than one at a time. LOL, so I was very excited to see them in a bigger bag. My granddaughter and kids in her kindergarten class love these, so was glad to get a larger quantity. I can always count on Walmart to get great bargains and was not disappointed. Thank you very much for always having a great selection and a great prices too.

For many people chocolate is the answer, but others like hard candies and sweets that are chewy, have long-lasting flavor or have breath-freshening capabilities. If you need to buy a few pieces or buy candy in bulk for Halloween or Easter, check out our Every Day Low Prices on candy. Here's what to look for among the many varieties you can select. Chocolate Chocolate is available in many different forms. The three basic chocolate types are milk chocolate, dark chocolate and white chocolate. As the name indicates, milk chocolate is mixed with a certain amount milk and sugar. Dark chocolate is made with lesser amounts of milk. Dark chocolate is listed by the percentage of cocoa that makes up the confection, which commonly ranges between 70 percent and 99 percent. White chocolate is made the same way, but without the cocoa solids that go into milk chocolate and dark chocolate, which is why it's white in color. Plain chocolate bars are commonly available, but chocolate mixed with nuts and fruit's popular as well. There are also chocolate nuggets and teardrop-shaped individually wrapped candies, and some of these have nuts inside. Peanuts are the most common nuts mixed with chocolate, but almonds and cashews are available. Raisins are the most common fruit, but you can commonly find seasonal varieties with cherries or coconut. Don't forget chocolate-covered wafers and cookies. Nougat, caramel, peanut butter and mint are also commonly combined with chocolate. candy bars range in size from about 1/2 ounce to 1 1/2 ounces, but there are some that run as large as a 1/2 pound. Bars are available individually and in packs of four to six. There are also miniature bars sold in bags. Some sugar-free chocolate candies are available. Chewy candies Many chewy candies, including gummy candies, are fruit flavored and commonly made with fruit juice. Popular forms of chewy candies include jelly beans, caramels, licorice and taffy. Many chewy candies are sweet, but tart and sour forms are available. Most chewy candies are available in bags that feature multiple flavors. Black licorice is sold in multiples of one flavor only. Gummy candies are available in animal form, with bears and worms being the most common options. Also, there are some sugar-free chewy candies suitable for people with diabetes or those on low-carb diets. Hard candies Another candy type made with fruit juices is hard candy, which includes lollipops. The notable feature about hard candy is you can pop them into your mouth and suck on them for a long time. Caramel is another typical hard candy. Hard candies come in bags that range from around a 1/2 pound to as many as 5 pounds. Lollipops are individually wrapped, as are some hard candies. Some of the fruit-flavored hard candies are shaped like fruit. Gum and mints Two other types of sweets that are closely part of the candy family are mints and gum. Mints are similar to hard candies and retain many of the same properties except they're made with mint flavors rather than fruit or caramel flavors. These mints are typically flavored with peppermint, spearmint and wintergreen. These candies come in a variety of sizes and are available in bags or plastic canisters. Mints can freshen your breath in an instant and keep it smelling fresh long after the candy has melted away. There are also some mints that have a hint of fruit flavoring, such as strawberry or orange, mixed in with the candy. Many types are sugar free. Another kind of mint is soft candy patties with a strong mint flavor that are covered with chocolate. Chewing gum is made from a gum base that has been sweetened, colored and flavored. Many chewing gums have mint flavoring and serve the same purpose as mints by freshening your breath. Other gums are fruit flavored and designed to deliver a sweet flavor as you chew. You can also choose bubble gum, which is usually sweet, pink and allows you to blow bubbles when you're not chewing. Gum is sold in individual packs of 8 to 12 sticks per pack, and there are packages that include multiple packs of gum. You can also buy gum in canisters, bags and tubs that dispense individual pieces. There are many sugar-free gum options available. Another form of bubble gum that children enjoy is bubble tape, which is a long, coiled strip of gum that you can rip off pieces to chew.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147366609, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
