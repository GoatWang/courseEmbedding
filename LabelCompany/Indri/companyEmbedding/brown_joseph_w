Joseph W. Brown - Wikipedia






















 






Joseph W. Brown

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Joseph W. Brown


General Joseph W. Brown was the brother of major general Jacob Brown, the founder of Brownville, New York. General Brown (and wife Cornelia), along with his brother-in-law Musgrove Evans (and wife Abi), their cousin Austin Wing and a dozen or so pioneers founded the town of Tecumseh, Michigan in 1824. General Joseph Brown died in 1880 at his daughter’s home in Toledo, Ohio.
From Tecumseh, General Brown ran a stage coach line which operated under the Western Stage Company and ran from Detroit through Ypsilanti, Saline, Tecumseh, Jonesville, White Pigeon, Niles, and Michigan City ending in Chicago – a total trip of just 4½ days (which frequently took six).
The route of Brown’s stage line between Saline and Jonesville – stopping in Tecumseh – was anything but the most direct. However, it required that the passengers have an overnight stay in Tecumseh where Brown also owned and operated a large Inn called the Peninsular House.
General Brown was involved in the Toledo War, having been appointed to protect the disputed area between Ohio and Michigan by then Michigan Governor Stevens T. Mason. In the spring of 1835 the tensions between Ohio and Michigan escalated when it was reported to that a survey party had encroached on Michigan territory and was camped south of Adrian at Phillips Corners. On April 26, 1835 Deputy Sheriff, Colonel William McNair of Tecumseh led a party to intercept the survey group from Ohio. General Brown went along with the essentially civilian group as “special agent of the Territory to watch the Ohio situation” his official title per gubernatorial appointment.
Shots were fired but it was never clear if they were directed at the Ohio group or if they were for effect to flush them out of the cabins in which they were spending their Sabbath. Some Ohio “invaders” escaped while about a dozen were captured. These were escorted back to Adrian where all but one were released. Engineer, Colonel Fletcher, was retained to “test the validity of the arrest.” Colonel Fletcher spent some months in custody in Tecumseh. Benjamin Baxter’s account of the events, found in Clara Waldron’s One Hundred Years – A Country Town, states that Fletcher was:

"a genial gentleman not suffering apparently from his term of incarceration, but sometimes subjecting us to the inconvenience of hunting him up when we had occasion to use the jail for some counterfeiter or horse thief, as he was likely to be found out riding with one of the sheriff’s lovely daughters, having taken the jail keys with him."

Later in 1835 General Brown would lead a large group of soldiers to Toledo to protect the rights of the Territory of Michigan. In his memoirs, also quoted in Clara Waldron’s book, Dr. M. A. Patterson says of Brown:

“As a commander of the Michigan forces in the Black Hawk War, he had acquitted himself to the entire satisfaction of the territorial and national authorities. As commander of the Toledo expedition, he performed his duties equally well and secured all that was desired of the expedition, which was to prevent the Executive of Ohio from trampling upon the rights of the people of Michigan.”

It is suggested that General Brown’s "moderation and good sense helped prevent possible bloodshed."

          Brown, Joseph E.Wartime Governor of Georgia          Quantity in Basket:None Code: CW-AU-CS-062Price: $85.00Shipping Weight: 1.00 pounds1 available for immediate delivery           

     Quantity:         Brown, Joseph E. (1821-1894)Joseph Emerson Brown, arguably the most influential Confederate governor, was born in the Pickens District of South Carolina on April 15, 1821. He moved to Union City, Georgia and worked as a laborer while intermittently attending local schools. As a young man, Brown taught school, studied law, and after being admitted to the bar, attended Yale Law School until his graduation in 1846. He began practicing law in the village of Canton, but in 1849, he was elected to the Georgia State Senate. After serving one term, Brown returned to his law practice until 1855, when he was elected as a judge of the superior court of the Blue Ridge circuit. Two years later he was the compromise choice for the Democratic party in the state gubernatorial election. Though not widely known throughout the state, he won the election, and began almost immediately to promote the rights of the state over the national government. He reformed and expanded the militia, promoted state education, and lobbied heavily for agricultural interests (Brown was a prominent land and slave holder). An avid secessionist, Brown was elated when Georgia left the Union, and gladly ordered the possession of all of the Federal property in the state, including Fort Pulaski and the Augusta Arsenal. He worked hard to organize and arm military units, but very quickly became at odds with Confederate President Jefferson Davis on how and where those troops were to be used. He frequently lashed out at the Davis administration, feeling that the Confederate government was becoming too large and usurping powers that ultimately belonged to the governors of the individual states. He opposed Confederate conscription policies, government imposed tax laws, and the administration�s suspension of habeas corpus. Late in the war, Brown became especially hard to deal with regarding troop levies, as he felt that it was more important to defend Georgia�s borders than to send soldiers to fight in far off Virginia. Despite these many difficulties, Georgia still gave thousands of soldiers and untold amounts of supplies to the Confederate cause. Late in 1864, Governor Brown fled the state capital at Milledgeville on the approach of Major General William T. Sherman�s soldiers, but at the close of the war he was captured and imprisoned in Washington, D. C. for a time. Following his release, Brown shocked and angered his former constituents by advising them to accept the Reconstruction government. Nevertheless, he was very successful in mining, railroad, and real-estate endeavors, many of which were important to rebuilding the shattered economy of the state. He was elected chief justice of the state supreme court in 1868, a position he held until 1870. In 1880 he was appointed by the Democratic governor to the United States Senate, later that year he elected on his own merits. He remained in the Senate until his retirement on March 3, 1891. Joseph E. Brown died on November 30, 1894 in Atlanta, Georgia and is buried in Oakland Cemetery. His son, Joseph Mackey Brown, served as governor of Georgia from 1909 to 1911 and again from 1912 to 1913.

The presently offered document is a post-war check, executed and signed by Brown while he was serving in the United States Senate. The check was drawn on �LOWRYS� BANK, 69 EAST ALABAMA STREET, COR. LOYD ST. ATLANTA, GA.�, with the principals of the establishment being �W. M. & R. J. LOWRY, BANKERS�, and was issued to �J. A. Corbally� on �Nov 14 1885�. All of the preceding information is either pre-printed or written on the check, as are the city of issue and the fact that the check was issued in the amount of �Sixty four 90/100Dollars�. It is boldly signed at the conclusion by �Joseph E. Brown�, and is endorsed by �J. A. Corbally� on the verso. All of the manuscript portions are executed in purple ink except for the endorsement on the verso, which was added in period iron gall ink. Brown�s signature is sharp and bold, and measures an impressive four inches long. The check itself measures approximately 3.10 x 8.40 inches, and given its size, it would look great displayed with a portrait of Brown as governor during the Civil War. 

A quick search of the records indicates that there was a J. A. Corbally who served as a private in Company C, Whiteside�s Naval Battalion Georgia Infantry (Local Defense). Whether this is the same individual is not known, but both men are listed as J. A. in the records. 

As with most financial documents of the era, this document exhibits numerous signs of period use and subsequent storage. Three vertical folds are present, two of which bisect Brown�s signature (that�s part of the problem with having a large signature). Minor soiling is noted along the fold lines on the verso, while the front appears remarkably clean (very minor soling can be seen in the selvage at the upper left). When the note was presented and redeemed, the check was torn at the center as a form of cancellation (we�ve handled numerous checks bearing this form of cancellation). This cancellation has affected the signature of Corbally on the verso, as well as his name on the front. Several small holes, apparently not associated with the cancellation, are located to the left and right of center, with minor paper loss on the farthest left. The edges are slightly irregular, though none of the major design elements or the signature are adversely affected. A very attractive example of this powerful Southern governor, with possible Georgia state soldier connections.
