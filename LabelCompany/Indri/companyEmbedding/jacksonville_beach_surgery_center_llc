What's an ASC?






Ambulatory Surgery Centers—known as ASCs—are modern health care facilities focused on providing same-day surgical care, including diagnostic and preventive procedures.



You Have a Choice
We believe patients deserve more choices when it comes to surgery.
Everyone should have access to local and personalized healthcare. By focusing on remaining efficient and maintaining high standards of quality care, Ambulatory Surgery Centers, like Jacksonville Beach Surgery Center, provide the best outpatient surgical experience possible at a lower cost. When considering the alternatives, who wouldn't choose that? Watch the video to learn more, then ask your physician about Jacksonville Beach Surgery Center.



Why Choose An ASC?
Quality.

Clinical excellence. 
Over 50% of ASCs nationwide have an infection rate of 0%.
All healthcare facilities in the United States are highly regulated to ensure quality care and patient safety. Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASCs) are no exception to this rule. Our facilities are independently regulated by processes including state licensure, voluntary accreditation, and Medicare certification. Studies show this attention to quality enables ASCs to outperform hospitals when it comes to clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Learn More...
 
Value.

Efficient. Money-saving. 
Choosing an ASC can save some patients up to 50% in out-of-pocket expenses. 
ASCs work to provide the best surgical experience possible at a lower cost to patients. Because they are more efficient when it comes to same-day surgery, patients typically pay less co-insurance at an ASC for the same procedure received in a hospital setting. And patients don't have to wait to see the savings; in an effort to make pricing more transparent, cost information is generally available to patients prior to surgery. Learn More...
 

Convenience.

Accessible. Time-saving.
Over 70% of all ASC procedures start within seven minutes of schedule.
There are over 5,000 ASCs across the country, and with each one comes more patient choice. As the industry grows, so does the list of both outpatient surgeries and non-surgical procedures available to patients in a local, personalized ASC setting. And because of physician ownership in ASCs, scheduling of facilities and resources becomes more efficient, which means fewer surgery delays for patients. Learn More...

 

Why our patients choose Jacksonville Beach Surgery Center:
Some of our patients pay up to 50% less in out-of-pocket expense for the same surgical procedure than they would at a local hospital.
Patients can conveniently access registration, waiting rooms, surgical suites and recovery rooms, all in the same location. 
With a cross-infection rate of less than 0.1%, our patients are able to heal quickly and get back to their lives. 
Being smaller than an acute-care hospital allows us to really tend to our patients, giving them a relaxed, friendly environment to rest in and recuperate.
All surgeries at Jacksonville Beach Surgery Center are scheduled, so your procedure will never be delayed due to an emergency surgery.
Because of our surgery schedule, we know exactly how many staff members we need to serve our patients each day. Never being understaffed means we can truly focus on our patients.

                                10-position all-numeric identification number assigned by the NPS to uniquely identify a health care provider.

                                Organization
                            

                                Code describing the type of health care provider that is being assigned an NPI. Codes are:

1 = (Person): individual human being who furnishes health care;
2 = (Non-person): entity other than an individual human being that furnishes health care (for example, hospital, SNF, hospital subunit, pharmacy, or HMO).





                                Is Organization Subpart
                            

                                N
                            

                                The "Is the organization a subpart?" question must be answered. If the organization is a subpart, the Parent Organization Legal Business Name (LBN) and Parent Organization Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) fields must be completed. The Parent Organization LBN and TIN fields can only be completed if the answer to the subpart question is Yes.
Many organization health care providers who apply for NPIs are not legal entities themselves but are parts of other organization health care providers that are legal entities (the "parents"). 
Here are three examples of organization health care providers that may be considered subparts and may apply for NPIs if so directed by their "parents": 
(1) The psychiatric unit in a hospital is not a legal entity but is part of the hospital (the "parent"), which is a legal entity. The legal entity must obtain an NPI. The psychiatric unit is an example of a subpart that could have its own NPI if the hospital determines that it should. 
(2) A group practice that is not a sole proprietorship has a main location and could have other offices in different locations, but each office is not a separate legal entity; instead, each office is part of the corporation (the "parent") which is a legal entity. The offices are examples of subparts that could have their own NPIs if the main location determines that they should. 
(3) A pharmacy fills prescriptions for patients whose physicians have prescribed medications for them and may also rent or sell durable medical equipment to patients whose physicians have ordered such equipment for them. Neither the pharmacy line of business nor the DME line of business represent legal entities; instead, both lines of business are part of an organization (the "parent") that is a legal entity. Each line of business represents a different Healthcare Provider Taxonomy or area of specialization that often submits its own electronic claims to health plans. 
The "parent"-we don't know who the parent is in this example-must ensure that each subpart that submits its own claims to health plans has its own NPI.

A field cannot contain all special characters.

1

					Some organization health care providers are made up of components that furnish different types of health care or have separate physical locations where health care is furnished. These components and physical locations are not themselves legal entities, but are part of the organization health care provider (which is a legal entity).
					A covered organization provider may decide that its subparts (if it has any) should have their own NPI numbers. If a subpart conducts any HIPAA standard transactions on its own (e.g., separately from its parent), it must obtain its own NPI number.
