Biography of Bradbury H. Anderson


As vice chairman and chief executive officer for Best Buy Co., Inc., a multinational retailer of technology and entertainment products and services, Brad Anderson champions the ongoing development of leaders at all levels within the enterprise in order to germinate new ideas to drive and sustain the company’s growth and success. He believes that constant innovation is required to enhance the quality of the customer’s experience and is convinced that the best ideas come from those employees who are closest to the customer.Anderson, a voracious reader of biographies and history, recognizes that innovation is often accompanied by challenge and change, which can become the platform for tremendous learning opportunities. He is convinced that taking advantage of people’s inherent strengths and talents provides the necessary fuel to run the engine of top-line growth, value creation and sustained profitability. He believes employees can have fun while being the best and demands that integrity, humility and respect are demonstrated by all.A lifelong audiophile, Anderson joined the company in 1973 as a commissioned salesman at the fledgling Sound of Music, a small chain of stereo stores that was the precursor to Best Buy. Within weeks of joining the company, Anderson was ready to quit because he had not made a single sale. Then, he discovered the power of asking the right questions and truly listening to the customer’s answers. He became a successful sales person and eventually was named store manager. It was this early work that left Anderson with the indelible impression that a close-to-the-customer understanding of needs and operations would be key to Best Buy’s continued innovation and growth.Best Buy founder Dick Schulze recognized the success of Anderson’s retail operations expertise and named him vice president in 1981. Anderson worked closely with Schulze on all of the major strategic initiatives that transformed and grew Best Buy, including the move to a non-commissioned store staff and the decision to let customers browse for themselves in warehouse-style stores.In 1986, Anderson was promoted to executive vice president and was elected to Best Buy’s Board of Directors. In April 1991, he was promoted to president and chief operating officer. Anderson was named vice chairman in 2001. In June 2002, he assumed the position of chief executive officer.Today, Anderson leads approximately 140,000 employees throughout North America and China who strive to provide customers with superior experiences as they seek the technology and entertainment products and services to make their lives easier and more fun. He is guiding Best Buy through another transformation – from a product-centric company to one that is talent-powered and customer-driven.Anderson has an associate degree from Waldorf College, a liberal arts college located in Forest City, Iowa, and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Denver.Anderson’s charitable and volunteer efforts are highlighted by his participation on the boards of the American Film Institute, Best Buy Children’s Foundation, Minnesota Public Radio and Minnesota Early Learning Foundation. He currently serves on the Retail Industry Leaders Association Board, the Waldorf College Board of Regents and the General Mills Board of Directors.He recently was honored with the Entrepreneurial Excellence Award by CNBC and named one of “The Best CEOs in America” by Institutional Investor Magazine.

Brad Anderson (executive) - Wikipedia





















 






Brad Anderson (executive)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Bradbury "Brad" Anderson (born 1949) is the former CEO and Vice Chairman of consumer electronics retailer Best Buy. In fiscal 2006, he earned a salary of $1,164,283 and a bonus of $2,692,250. His annual compensation for fiscal year 2007 was $5.6 million, including $1,172,995 in salary, plus $2,650,969 in incentive-plan compensation.[1] In 2008, Anderson earned $49.3 million in total compensation, $1,172,995 in salary, $1,994,092 in incentive-plan compensation, stock awards of $413,635 and no option awards, and $46.08 million in value from exercising 1.05 million stock options.[2]
Born and raised in Sheridan, Wyoming, Anderson received an Associate of Arts from Waldorf College and a bachelor's degree from the University of Denver. In 1973, Anderson joined Sound of Music, a small chain of stereo stores that were the precursor to Best Buy, as a commissioned salesman; it took him two weeks to make his first sale.[3]
Best Buy-founder Richard Schulze named him vice president in 1981, where Anderson operated as the founder's right-hand man.
In the subsequent years, Schulze and Anderson turned the chain from a commission-driven store to a discount store, warehouse-style format.[4]
In 1986, Anderson was promoted to executive vice president and was elected to Best Buy’s Board of Directors. In April 1991, he was promoted to president and chief operating officer, vice chairman in 2001, and in June 2002, he assumed the position of chief executive officer. In June 2009, he was succeeded by Brian J. Dunn who was serving as president and chief operating officer.[5]
Anderson serves on the Waldorf College Board of Regents and the General Mills board of directors.
