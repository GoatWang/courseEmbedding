About Gardner, Inc. 







 




Gardner, one of the largest Parts Distributors for the Lawn and Garden  industry, is growing to better serve our current customers while  continuing to develop new opportunities in new territories.
          
 Gardner currently has distribution centers in Columbus, Ohio; Franklin, Massachusetts; and Jacksonville, Florida.  With the addition of our newest 200,000 square foot warehouse and  distribution center to our existing 300,000 square feet nationwide,  Gardner can efficiently serve all 50 U.S. States.
 Our foundation rests on the strength of all our services including: Sales & Marketing, Customer Service, EDI & Data Processing, Physical Distribution and Education. 
 We measure our success with high fill rates and on-time deliveries. Our  goal is to always provide your business with a quality of service that  is both quick and complete and at the lowest possible cost. 
 Our new up-to-the-minute distribution facility,  located in Columbus, Ohio is strategically located next to major  interstate highways to facilitate our shipping and receiving needs. The  facility utilizes a wide variety of material handling equipment  including man-a-board pickers and rider pallet trucks to efficiently  manage multiple truckloads of product on a daily basis. 
 Orders, whether received by phone, fax or  electronically, are processed through our state-of-the-art EDI &  Data Processing software which quickly converts the information into  real time orders. They are then launched using RF technology, allowing  them to be closely tracked throughout the entire distribution facility.  Orders that are picked directly into a box ("pick-to-shipper") for  shipping are routed directly to the manifesting lane and audited for  quality assurance. Utilizing an advanced computerized random location  system with simultaneous picking from multiple zones, travel time is  minimized and speed and productivity is increased. Using multiple  packing lanes for optimum efficiency, orders are individually checked  for accuracy before they are packed and sent to manifesting and  shipping. 
 This specialized system allows over 5 million line items to be processed  			annually. Our state-of-the-art shipping system automatically routes over  			15,000 parcels per day and prints a UCC128 conformance shipping label with  			the applicable carrier's bar code to complete the distribution process.

About Us: Company
Gardner, one of the largest family owned Parts Distributors for the Lawn and Garden industry, is growing to better serve our current customers while continuing to develop new opportunities in new territories.
Gardner currently has distribution centers in Columbus, Ohio; Franklin, Massachusetts; and Jacksonville, Florida. With the addition of our newest 200,000 square foot warehouse and distribution center to our existing 300,000 square feet nationwide, Gardner can efficiently serve all 50 U.S. States.
Our foundation rests on the strength of all our services including: Sales & Marketing, Customer Service, EDI & Data Processing, Physical Distribution and Education.
We measure our success with high fill rates and on-time deliveries. Our goal is to always provide your business with a quality of service that is both quick and complete and at the lowest possible cost. 
Our new up-to-the-minute distribution facility, located in Columbus, Ohio is strategically located next to major interstate highways to facilitate our shipping and receiving needs. The facility utilizes a wide variety of material handling equipment including man-a-board pickers and rider pallet trucks to efficiently manage multiple truckloads of product on a daily basis.
Orders, whether received by phone, fax or electronically, are processed through our state-of-the-art EDI & Data Processing software which quickly converts the information into real time orders. They are then launched using RF technology, allowing them to be closely tracked throughout the entire distribution facility. Orders that are picked directly into a box ("pick-to-shipper") for shipping are routed directly to the manifesting lane and audited for quality assurance. Utilizing an advanced computerized random location system with simultaneous picking from multiple zones, travel time is minimized and speed and productivity is increased. Using multiple packing lanes for optimum efficiency, orders are individually checked for accuracy before they are packed and sent to manifesting and shipping. 
This specialized system allows over 5 million line items to be processed annually. Our state-of-the-art shipping system automatically routes over 15,000 parcels per day and prints a UCC128 conformance shipping label with the applicable carrier's bar code to complete the distribution process.

what's up DOC?




It is with deep sadness and heavy heart I regret to announce that my friend, student, fellow shooter, and IPSC brother, Richard Cho has left the range.

Richard experienced a tragic accident on the range June11.2017 that resulted in his passing.

His many IPSC family members reacted in an unprecedented show of their love for him with their immediate response of the skills they possess to try to save his life. Despite their heroic efforts until an ambulance arrived and the continued efforts of the EMT staff, Richard did not survive.

Hug each other and hold your loved ones a little closer.

With all my love and sympathy to Richard�s family.

Murray (DOC) & Terry Gardner







RICHARD CHO'S CELEBRATION OF LIFE
Sunday July 30th 1-5pm
River Rock Casino in Richmond
*Team Wear*
We encourage people to wear shirts/jerseys that represent their sport. Rich loved to participate in all the sports and this will make for a colorful gathering.

OUR TESTIMONIALS SPEAK TO THE EXPERIENCE.




“We couldn’t be more pleased with the Gardner Group. They guided us through the entire home building process from selection of the lot to final CO. During the process Murray and Felicity were constantly looking ahead and anticipating any issues with the project; in so doing, they took all the stress out of what could otherwise be a difficult and involved process and eliminated any surprises. We love our house and can’t thank the Gardner Group enough for all of their assistance with it.”Tom Biafore

Research Interests: Comparative Pathology, Retroviruses



RESEARCHPUBLICATIONSPEOPLE
Although officially retired, Dr. Gardner remains an active and vital member of the CCM. Dr. Gardner’s major research interest for many years has been in the natural history of retroviruses in animals and man.  As part of the Virus Cancer Program from 1968-1980 he and his colleagues at USC School of Medicine in Los Angeles discovered and characterized Type C retroviruses of wild mice and domestic cats and carried out extensive studies on the epidemiology and virology of human cancer.  This led to the understanding of a new biology of retroviruses in wild mice that was a more accurate model than inbred mice for predicting the natural history of similar Type C retroviruses (i.e. HTLV) discovered a decade later in humans.  Study of naturally occurring Type C retroviruses in cats led to an appreciation of the horizontal transmission of feline leukemia virus among domestic cats and to discovery and characterization of several novel oncogenes in feline sarcomas. Endogenous infectious but nonpathogenic retroviruses were discovered in cats, mice and rats.  Since moving to UC Davis in 1981, Dr. Gardner has taken part in the discovery and description of simian AIDS caused by Type D retrovirus and also by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV, which is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1).  He and his colleagues have studied the origin, natural history, pathology and pathogenesis of these retroviruses and have carried out a number of experimental vaccine trials. His present interest is directed at better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS and attempts to develop more efficacious and safe vaccines against AIDS using the SIV macaque model.
Dr. Gardner has a broad interest in comparative pathology and has developed a Comparative Pathology Web page based on animal cases from the UC Davis Veterinary Hospital that are reviewed weekly at Biopsy Conference. About 2000 cases total from all species have been entered in the data base and slides of representative lesions have been collected from all cases. Dr. Gardner is updating this page on a regular basis by adding descriptions for the disease entities with special attention to features of comparative pathology interest and linkage to histopathology images.   Dr. Gardner remains actively involved with the teaching of medical and veterinary students and pre and post doctoral students.  Dr. Gardner promotes collaborative interactions and loves to share his enthusiasm for science and its history with his colleagues.

Dr. Murray Gardner is currently retired but remains an active participant of the Center for Comparative Medicine.  Please contact Dr. Gardner directly to get in touch with former laboratory staff members.
