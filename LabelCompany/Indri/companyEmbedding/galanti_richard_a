 Career History



Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer

                                    1984 - Current                


Costco Wholesale Corporation


                  What Is Costco?

We are a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing our members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. With hundreds of locations worldwide, Costco provides a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all designed to make your shopping experience a pleasurable one.
The History of Costco

The company's first location, opened in 1976 under the Price Club name, was in a converted airplane hangar on Morena Boulevard in San Diego. Originally serving only small businesses, the company found it could achieve far greater buying clout by also serving a selected audience of non-business members. With that change, the growth of the warehouse club industry was off and running. In 1983, the first Costco warehouse location was opened in Seattle. Costco became the first company ever to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in less than six years. When Costco and Price Club merged in 1993, the combined company, operating under the name PriceCostco, had 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.

Our operating philosophy has been simple. Keep costs down and pass the savings on to our members. Our large membership base and tremendous buying power, combined with our never-ending quest for efficiency, result in the best possible prices for our members. Since resuming the Costco name in 1997, the company has grown worldwide with total sales in recent fiscal years exceeding $64 billion

Does Costco need a new approach?

This post is part of the 10 Items or Less blog.
The above quote, one of my favorite remarks I’d written down over the last 12 months of covering the rapidly evolving world of food retail, came last September from Costco CFO Richard Galanti, who, as is often the case in analyst conference calls, was under light interrogation about the big club’s ability to withstand competition from Amazon without having a significant strategy to sell food online itself.
Events since then would indicate that Galanti’s message was heard loud and clear by Costco’s Seattle neighbor, which in June acknowledged as much by committing $13.7 billion to acquire one of the best in the fresh-food business, Whole Foods Market. .....

Costco Is a Buy Despite Amazon Fears: Analysts

..... ” Michael Laaser of UBS echoed the upbeat sentiment, writing in a research note that the latest report helped “serve as a reminder of just how powerful Costco’s membership model has become.”
While Costco’s online business is slated to make up just 3.5% of its overall sales this year, according to Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Richard Galanti, the wholesaler will beef up its digital initiative in order to better compete with the dominating force of Amazon. Although ecommerce is important to Costco’s future business, Galanti has reiterated the fact investors shouldn’t expect Costco to be like Amazon, as the company will continue to rely on bringing in members into its warehouses by improving merchandise, in-store experience and distribution logistics.

Driving the Message Home to Costco – Don’t Sell Products from the Seal Slaughter - Sea Shepherd Italy


















































 



































 Sea Shepherd News



 

 





		Giovedì 20 Aprile 2006 01:00	



Driving the Message Home to Costco -  Don't Sell Products from the Seal Slaughter
Steve Thompson, Sea Shepherd's point man on the  campaign to convince Costco to stop selling baby seal oil capsules, has  completed his opening protest at Costco's headquarters in Issaquah,  Washington.
His protest coincided with a meeting of Costco regional managers and there is  no doubt they got our message when an Ads Aloft plane flew overhead at 2:00 P.M.  towing a large banner calling for a boycott of Costco because they were  supporting the cruel slaughter of seals in Canada by selling seal oil capsules  in their store in Newfoundland.

Not only is this product illegal in the United  States, it is being marketed as a health food supplement despite the fact that  the product contains DDT, arsenic, PCB's, and mercury. Selling poison in  capsules made from the cruel massacre of harp seal pups is hardly a business  ethic to be proud of. Sea Shepherd has been getting a positive feedback  from Costco members worldwide who are boycotting the big box store until they  stop trading in cruelty and marine ecological destruction.
Read more about Costco's decision to sell a product derived from the annual Canadian seal  slaughter.
 
If you would like to let Costco know  how you feel about the fact that they sell a product derived from dead baby  seals:
