Sustainability







Claire's Commitment

Claire Manufacturing will continue its leadership in providing quality products that are environmentally preferred given the availability of raw materials and within the limitations of pressurized chemistry. We will continue our industry-leading stewardship of developing new products that continue to strike the harmonious balance between high-quality, highperformance products and responsible environmental management.
This position paper marks the beginning of Claire’s ongoing commitment to fully integrate environmental concerns into our everyday business model. The core elements of our initiative are:

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and VOCs - Claire Manufacturing has set a goal to continually monitor and improve our formulations so that we can achieve a 10% reduction over the next 3 years.
Driving formulation transformation - Claire Manufacturing continues to invest in Research & Development to identify more environmentally friendly products.
Leveraging World Class Expertise - Claire Manufacturing participates in leadership in several key industry associations to insure that we are ahead of the curve from an environmental standpoint. These organizations include the ISSA, CSPA, and the WAIB.



Our Mission

These days, one can hardly turn on the television or pick up a newspaper without hearing or reading about the “Green” movement. Everything from light bulbs to appliances, even seafood, is being labeled as green.
The word “Green” means different things to different people. To Claire Manufacturing, it simply means doing all things in a more sustainable way. To us, the word green isn’t a destination; it’s a process of constantly looking to do more with less and to minimize our environmental footprint. Our formulas, our packaging, even our processes are constantly scrutinized to find ways to minimize our environmental impact. The concept of sustainability is not unique to Claire Manufacturing. In fact, there are many other companies that share our vision of sustainability.





The Facts About Aerosols

Since 1978, U.S. regulations have banned the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in aerosols. Today, most aerosol products, including 98 percent of those made  and sold in the U.S., do not contain CFCs.
Aerosol products do emit some Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). This is in part from the propellants used, but also from solvents and other components in the product itself. Preliminary estimates indicate that of all man-made VOCs emitted each year, consumer products account for approximately 2 to 4 percent. The portion in aerosol containers account for only a fraction of that figure, and are largely composed of the least reactive VOCs. In fact, the vast majority of VOCs result from car  and truck emissions.
Eliminating all aerosols as a way to reduce VOC emissions would wipe out valuable consumer products and a well-developed industry in exchange for essentially no improvement in air quality. In addition, many products in non-aerosol forms such as liquids and pump sprays often require more solvents to be effective, thus resulting in higher VOC emissions than aerosols.



Is It Green?

“Greenwashing" is the act of misleading consumers regarding the environmental practices of a company or the environmental benefits of the products and services offered by that company. A very simple example of “greenwashing” is the act of claiming that a product is all natural. On the surface, all natural sounds very positive, but be cautious! Products containing lead and arsenic could easily be labeled as all natural but would cause tremendous physical harm. At the present time, examples of “greenwashing” are prevalent in almost all packaging forms and this must stop so that we can achieve real environmental improvements. This is why third party certification is so very important. Without third-party review, the consumer has no way to know that environmental claims have been independently verified.




Core Initiatives

Claire Manufacturing will continue its leadership in providing quality products that are environmentally preferred given the availability of raw materials and within the limitations of pressurized chemistry. We will continue our industry-leading stewardship of developing new products that continue to strike the harmonious balance between high-quality, high performance products and responsible environmental management.
The core elements of our initiative are:

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and VOCs - Claire Manufacturing has set a goal to continually monitor and improve our formulations so that we can achieve a 10% reduction over the next 3 years.
Driving formulation transformation - Claire Manufacturing continues to invest in Research & Development to identify more environmentally friendly products.
Leveraging World Class Expertise - Claire Manufacturing participates in leadership in several key industry associations to ensure that we are ahead of the curve from an environmental standpoint. These organizations include the ISSA, CSPA and the WAIB.



Recycling

Empty aerosol containers are as recyclable as other steel cans. Almost 90 percent of aerosol containers are made primarily of steel with a thin coating of tin. The tin is recovered during processing and plastic components are burned during reheating. In today’s large-scale recycling facilities, any propellant or product left in cans presents no hazard.NOTE: Aerosols are hermetically sealed so that their contents cannot leak or spill. They are tamper-resistant, tamper-evident and provide controlled, water-conserving, high-quality performance. There is no potential for under or over-diluted concentrates that cause poor cleaning results. Aerosols eliminate the mixing of improper products that could cause damage. The aerosol container is designed to deliver the right amount of product exactly where it’s needed.TIP: Use every last bit of the product to get the full benefit and value from the can. Just make sure the can is completely empty before you recycle it. Every effort you take goes a long way to help our planet.
Packaging
This can is made of recyclable steel, the world’s most recycled material.
Our cans are made with 25% to 32% recycled steel depending on can style.
The caps and spray tips are recyclable.
Our shipping box utilizes 37% recycled material.
Fact...65% of steel containers are recycled versus 6% for plastic containers.

Here’s What Mark’s Clients Have to Say





I was lucky enough to be able to have a healing session with Mark. I cannot express how amazing his healing work is! If you have any limiting beliefs standing in your way of whatever greatness you wish to bring into your life, I highly recommend Mark's healing work! After our first session, I felt like a different person, and I was able to handle the media attention because the fears around being so visible in the world had shifted so profoundly during my work with Mark. We had a second session to help me prepare for giving the workshop.

This time I felt like we had touched something so deep inside me that we had only begun to get to it. Nevertheless, the session allowed me to step out of my comfort zone with confidence when I gave the workshop. At the follow-up session I felt a physical expansion in my chest as the energetic blocks in place for years were melted away. Again, I feel like a new person. Please do yourself a favor and experience Mark's incredible gifted healing work!
- Stephanie Amada, author of Hooking Up: A Sexy Encounter with Choice




WOW. Mark was such an amazingly powerful instrument in one of the biggest spiritual breakthroughs in my life. I was really feeling a bit too much overloaded with negative inner stuff. He guided me so skillfully and gently through the process that after a while I was in a “rapture” state. It was my breakthrough, but it happened because he was absolutely attuned to me throughout. I was delighted by his great sensibility and coaching skills. I LOVE YOU, Mark. I am so grateful for you. And I have to say, if anyone needs an awesome coach, he is the one.
- Yolanda W.  Memphis, Tenn




Mark’s work with me blew my notion of what’s possible out of the water. I had suffered for years with a lower back pain. The conventional medical route did very little to alleviate the suffering. Then Mark went to work over the phone. He went into the heart of the issue and dissolved it. What was left (and there all the time) was a healthy me I simply wasn’t getting to. His energy healing is fantastic. It also gave me a whole new awareness of myself and how to approach life. Do yourself a favor and give him a call.
- Mike C.  Toronto , Ont




Mark is a one-of-a-kind therapist with a true gift and soul. Working with him I received the grace of forgiveness, joy, and inner peace. I highly recommend him from the bottom of my heart. When you work with Mark be ready for wholeness, joy, and miracles in your life.
- Danielle Nistor, Best selling author and spiritual teacher




I needed healing and Mark miraculously appeared in my life. Mark is a Powerful spiritual healer. He has a Divine gift from God as a Healer. His ability to read my body and mind took him right to the core of my issues. He followed his Spirit and used his gifts to heal and empower me. I highly recommend Mark. He is a true man of God. He is a spiritual man full of God's love. Be prepared for a miraculous healing.
- Jenny B. Chesterfield, MO




I am left in Awe after our healing session tonight.
I called you to fill you in on our last session which to me was so profound and so healing I had no idea I was in for another beautiful healing.

I have been on the healing path for many years. I am 56 and never before after speaking with someone for one minute was brought straight to the wound that needed to be healed. You brought me straight to my eleven-year-old boy who was so badly wounded and isolated and longing to be embraced, healed him, and brought him back to me. For days afterwords I was finding many aspects of my wounded child all over my life as far back as a three year old abandoned and forgotten. I cried many tears and healed every one of them and brought them all into my being.
I feel so blessed and at peace to have accomplished all this in such a short time. And to top it all off tonight you opened up more of me to embrace the divine energies to heal my body and embrace fully who I am. I am presently in a complete state of silent bliss and am bursting with gratitude for all I have been blessed with.

Mark, you are a very special and unique gift to this world. You are very gentle and loving and blessed by the special choice of words you use that invoke such profound healing. You work in such a respectful and sacred way it removes all barriers and supports the healing process. Its obvious you have done tremendous work on yourself to be able to be so clear and effective. I thank you with all my heart for the blessing you have been to me.
- Joe K. Toronto, ON
