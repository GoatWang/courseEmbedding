 Educational Background



Juris Doctorate 
Class of 1973 


The George Washington University - Law School

                  Since enrolling its first class in 1865, The George Washington University Law School has produced some of the finest minds across the spectrum of legal scholarship. That tradition continues today, as GW Law graduates use the knowledge and skills they gain here to influence the critical legal conversations of our times.                




Bachelor of Arts 
Class of 1969 


University of Virginia

                  The University of Virginia (often abbreviated as UVA, UVa, or Virginia) is a public research university in Charlottesville, Virginia, United States. It was conceived and designed by U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, and established in 1819. UVA's initial Board of Visitors included former Presidents of the United States Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe. Monroe owned the initial site of the University, which was mostly farmland. His law office and farmhouse are now the site of Brown College at Monroe Hill, a residential college at UVA.

UVA is one of the eight original Public Ivy universities, and it is the only university campus in the United States that is designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In the 2013 edition of U.S. News and World Report's National University Rankings, the school was listed as America's 2nd best public university; tied with UCLA and surpassed only by UC Berkeley.                




 


The George Washington University

                  The George Washington University actively engages Washington, D.C., and the world. Their location in the heart of Washington places them at the core of U.S. government, policy and law. They sit where the worlds of science, technology, media and the arts converge. Their students and faculty have the unparalleled opportunity to study and work alongside leaders and practitioners in every discipline, to take part in the interchanges that shape our community and the world.
The George Washington University was created in 1821 through an Act of Congress, fulfilling George Washington’s vision of an institution in the nation’s capital dedicated to educating and preparing future leaders.
Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. They have more than 20,000 students—from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries—studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy.
GW comprises three campuses—Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, Va.—as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, Va.

Connecticut Bar Association, Inc.

                  The Connecticut Bar Association, Inc. (CBA) is the preeminent organization for lawyers and the legal profession in Connecticut. The CBA is a non-profit organization pursuant to section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. Through its members, the CBA is dedicated to promoting public service and advancing the principles of law and justice.

The CBA was founded on June 2, 1875. (Three years later, CBA representatives held a convention in Saratoga Springs, New York, to consider establishing a national bar association. The creation of the American Bar Association was a direct result of that action by the CBA.) From its creation, the CBA was instrumental in developing and improving court rules and providing quality educational and networking opportunities for its members.

Over the next century, the CBA began numerous programs to provide benefits and resources to members and to improve the practice of law. These programs include a formal and dynamic continuing legal education program (CLE); the Connecticut Bar Journal, the organization's official publication; Connecticut Lawyer magazine; the Connecticut Council of Bar Presidents; substantive law sections; and committees.

In 1975, with membership at approximately 4,000, the CBA celebrated its 100th anniversary and adopted a new logo representing "equal justice through law."

In 1987, the CBA hired its first full-time lobbyist to serve as the members' voice at the state Capitol. In 2001, the organization's legislative area was expanded to two full-time lobbyists and a full-time legislative assistant "to encourage good legislation to the extent that partisan interests are not served thereby and to discourage bad legislation."

National Health Lawyers Association

                  The National Health Lawyers Association (NHLA) was formed in 1971 as a nonprofit educational organization whose membership included health attorneys who represented hospitals, physicians, managed care organizations, home health agencies, and long term care facilities. Over time, the NHLA grew to over 8,500 members, producing educational programs and publications, including the Health Law Digest.

Beginning in 1996, leaders of both the Academy and the NHLA began talks on merging the two organizations and on July 1, 1997, the NHLA and the Academy merged. At first the combined organization was called the NHLA/AAHA, but in 1998 the name was changed to the American Health Lawyers Association.
