 Steve's litigation practice concentrates on commercial and business litigation, product liability defense, and general civil litigation and appeals. He is a certified mediator and arbitrator. After nearly 25 years in law practice, Steve decided to migrate into the area of family law, where he now advises clients and represents them in litigation regarding separation and divorce, child custody and support, alimony and post-separation support, and equitable distribution. His decision to migrate into this new practice area germinated from his own two-year odyssey through the family court justice system, which culminated in a positive outcome for Steve and his three children. He draws upon his experience as a litigator and as a family law client to assist his family law clients in obtaining favorable outcomes for them and their children. Steve is a frequent CLE presenter on a wide range of litigation topics.

Biography
STEVEN B. EPSTEIN of Epstein Becker & Green, P.C., is a pioneer in the legal specialty known as health care law. For over 35 years, Mr. Epstein has played a unique role in the establishment of the concept that health care organizations require a dedicated form of legal representation. During such time, Mr. Epstein was also instrumental in the acceptance of managed care as the most prominent form of health care delivery.
Chambers USA has ranked Mr. Epstein among the "Leaders in Their Field" in the Healthcare category (2009 to 2017) and has referred to him as the "father of the healthcare [legal] industry." Chambers noted in 2017 that Mr. Epstein "is a vastly experienced healthcare expert who draws on first-hand knowledge of managed care regulatory development. Clients describe him as 'exceptionally experienced and knowledgeable in pretty much all areas of healthcare, whether it's transactions or regulations or just in terms of his connections with organizations around the world.'" Other honors include the following: Selected for inclusion by his peers in The Best Lawyers in America© (2008 to 2017) in the field of Health Care Law; included on the Washington DC's Super Lawyers list (2007 to 2017) in the area of Health Care; named as a member of the Greater Washington Legal Elite by Washington Smart CEO; included in DC Magazine's Top Attorneys (2008 to 2011); listed in the Washington Post's Baltimore & Washington Top Lawyers (2011, 2012); and recognized by The Legal 500 United States (2011 to 2017). He has also received recognition for earning an "AV Preeminent" Peer Review Rating by Martindale-Hubbell (signifying the highest level of professional excellence) for 30 years.
Mr. Epstein founded Epstein Becker & Green, P.C., in 1973. The firm has grown to approximately 250 lawyers in 13 cities and is generally recognized as one of the leading law firms in health care law, with over 100 attorneys dedicated to that specialty. In 2012, Chambers & Partners honored Epstein Becker Green with the Chambers USA Award for Excellence in the health care category, recognizing the firm's preeminence in that practice area and outstanding work, impressive strategic growth, and excellence in client service. As the senior health partner in the firm, Mr. Epstein provides a wide range of health care organizations and providers with strategic legal guidance responding to the legal challenges and opportunities of the rapidly changing American health care system. In this connection, Mr. Epstein currently sits on the Boards of a number of health care companies.
Epstein Becker & Green supports clients throughout the country in 25 different areas of health practice, ranging from health policy to strategic partnering to complex compliance issues.
Mr. Epstein, a graduate of the Columbia Law School (L '68), currently serves as chairman of the Columbia Law School Board of Visitors. He received Columbia University's Distinguished Alumni Award at Columbia University's 2007 graduation ceremonies. He received Columbia Law School's Medal for Excellence — Columbia Law School's most prestigious award — in 2009.
Mr. Epstein graduated from Tufts University in 1965, where he earned the Donald A. Cowdery Memorial Award for leadership and was the editor-in-chief of the Tufts Weekly. He was awarded the Tufts University Distinguished Alumni Award in 1999. Mr. Epstein served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Tufts from 1999 to 2009 and currently serves as a "Director Emeritus."
Following graduation from Columbia, Mr. Epstein joined the Wall Street law firm of Barrett Knapp Smith & Shapiro. He has served as a legal consultant to the Health Maintenance Organization Service, Health Services and Mental Health Administration, U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

(more...)A mistake by both spouses in a marriage that can serve as grounds for an annulment. For example, if one spouse went into the marriage wanting children while the other did not, they have a misunderstanding that will be judged serious enough for a court to terminate the marriage.

(more...)The payment made to a lawyer for legal services. These fees may take several forms: hourly per job or service -- for example, $350 to draft a will contingency (the lawyer collects a percentage of any money she wins for her client and nothing if there is no recovery), or retainer (usually a down payment as part of an hourly or per job fee agreement). Attorney fees must usually be paid by the client who hires a lawyer, though occasionally a law or contract will require the losing party of a lawsuit to pay the winner's court costs and attorney fees. For example, a contract might contain a provision that says the loser of any lawsuit between the parties to the contract will pay the winner's attorney fees. Many laws designed to protect consumers also provide for attorney fees -- for example, most state laws that require landlords to provide habitable housing also specify that a tenant who sues and wins using that law may collect attorney fees. And in family law cases -- divorce, custody and child support -- judges often have the power to order the more affluent spouse to pay the other spouse's attorney fees, even where there is no clear victor.

(more...)In community property states, property owned and controlled entirely by one spouse in a marriage. At divorce, separate property is not divided under the state's property division laws, but is kept by the spouse who owns it. Separate property includes all property that a spouse obtained before marriage, through inheritance or as a gift. It also includes any property that is traceable to separate property -- for example, cash from the sale of a vintage car owned by one spouse before marriage-and any property that the spouses agree is separate property. Compare community property and equitable distribution.

BEST INTERESTS (OF THE CHILD)The test that courts use when deciding who will take care of a child. For instance, an adoption is allowed only when a court declares it to be in the best inter... (more...)The test that courts use when deciding who will take care of a child. For instance, an adoption is allowed only when a court declares it to be in the best interests of the child. Similarly, when asked to decide on custody issues in a divorce case, the judge will base his or her decision on the child's best interests. And the same test is used when judges decide whether a child should be removed from a parent's home because of neglect or abuse. Factors considered by the court in deciding the best interests of a child include: age and sex of the child mental and physical health of the child mental and physical health of the parents lifestyle and other social factors of the parents emotional ties between the parents and the child ability of the parents to provide the child with food, shelter, clothing and medical care established living pattern for the child concerning school, home, community and religious institution quality of schooling, and the child's preference.

(more...)A divorce automatically granted by a court when the spouse who is served with a summons and complaint for divorce fails to file a formal response with the court. Many divorces proceed this way when the spouses have worked everything out and there's no reason for both to go to court -- and pay the court costs.

(more...)After a wrongful death lawsuit, the portion of a judgment intended to compensate a plaintiff for having to live without a deceased person. The compensation is intended to cover the earnings and the emotional comfort and support the deceased person would have provided.

FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT (FMLA)A federal law that requires employers to provide an employee with 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a year's time for the birth or adoption of a child, family hea... (more...)A federal law that requires employers to provide an employee with 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a year's time for the birth or adoption of a child, family health needs or personal illness. The employer must allow the employee to return to the same position or a position similar to that held before taking the leave. There are exceptions to the FMLA: the most notable is that only employers with 50 or more employees are covered--about half the workforce.

(more...)Someone appointed by a court to care for the property of a minor child that is not supervised by an adult under some other legal method, such as a trust. A guardian of the estate may also be called a 'property guardian' or 'financial guardian.' See also guardian.

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.
