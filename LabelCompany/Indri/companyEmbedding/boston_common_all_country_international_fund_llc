Boston Common International Fund - Overview
The Boston Common International Fund’s goal is to preserve and build capital over the long term through investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) of companies it believes are high quality and undervalued. As the Fund’s manager, Boston Common Asset Management looks for companies that, in its opinion, have sound governance and a history of responsible financial management which the advisor believes have the potential to be consistently profitable over a long time horizon. The Fund includes those companies that the advisor believes are operating successfully in economic sectors with superior end-market growth, or are beneficiaries of broader sector themes they have identified, but that they judge to be trading at discounts to intrinsic value.
The Fund seeks to integrate environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) criteria into the stock selection process and expresses a preference for best-in-class firms that they believe possess innovative approaches to the environmental and social challenges their industries, society, and the world as a whole face. Boston Common endeavors to integrate financial and sustainability factors into its investment process because they believe ESG research helps them identify companies that will be successful over the long-term. They seek companies that can capitalize on new market opportunities, implement efficiency improvements and avoid unanticipated costs stemming from inadequate attention to ESG risks. As a result, Boston Common believes ESG research helps improve portfolio quality and financial return potential.
Sustainability in the Fund
Boston Common uses its voice on behalf of the Fund’s shareholders to raise environmental, social, and governance issues with the management of select portfolio companies through a variety of channels. These include dialogue with management, voting proxies in accordance with ESG guidelines, and participation in the annual shareholder meeting process. Through these efforts, Boston Common seeks to encourage company managements towards greater transparency, accountability, and commitment to ESG issues.
Our target avenues for promoting social change:

Constructive Dialogue with Management
Targeted Data Gathering
Work with U.S. and International Organizations
Public Policy Testimony
Proxy Voting
