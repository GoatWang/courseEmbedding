During the period from September 2002 through April 2007, it is likely that the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would have differed from the allocations on April 1, 2007, and the performance shown is not necessarily representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio been in existence during the entire period.

	 1 Allocations are subject to change over time and exclude cash.2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2016 are of the Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio and are net of investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively. The performance figures shown may include returns that are preliminary, unaudited, and estimated based on the most recent information provided by underlying fund managers, and are subject to change. For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. The Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio is a model portfolio/asset allocation program. This Portfolio may not reflect an investor’s actual portfolio as actual portfolios reflect each investor’s own objectives and risk tolerances. The performance of the Portfolio is based on the weighted performance over the respective periods of the Aetos Capital SEC-Registered Funds, weighted according to the allocations in effect during the periods. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. The Aetos Capital Growth Portfolio is a model portfolio/asset allocation program. This Portfolio may not reflect an investor’s actual portfolio as actual portfolios reflect each investor’s own objectives and risk tolerances. The performance of the Portfolio is based on the weighted performance over the respective periods of the Aetos Capital SEC-Registered Funds, weighted according to the allocations in effect during the periods. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

1 Allocations are subject to change over time. 2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through January 31, 2016 of the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio and are net of an investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively Aetos Capital formalized the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio in April 2007. The performance figures shown for periods prior to April 2007 are those of the Aetos Capital Funds comprising the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio, weighted according to the allocations on April 1, 2007. During the period from September 2002 through April 2007, it is likely that the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would have differed from the allocations on April 1, 2007, and the performance shown is not necessarily representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos Capital Prime Portfolio been in existence during the entire period. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

1 Allocations are subject to change over time. 2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through January 31, 2016 are of the Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio and are net of investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively. For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. The Aetos Capital Balanced Portfolio is a model portfolio/asset allocation program. This Portfolio may not reflect an investor’s actual portfolio as actual portfolios reflect each investor’s own objectives and risk tolerances. The performance of the Portfolio is based on the weighted performance over the respective periods of the Aetos Capital SEC-Registered Funds, weighted according to the allocations in effect during the periods. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements.

1 Allocations are subject to change over time. 2 Performance figures shown for the period of September 1, 2002 through January 31, 2016 are of the Aetos Capital Credit and Distressed Opportunities Portfolio and are net of investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return, respectively. For performance fee calculation purposes, it is assumed that an investor redeems each December 31 and invests each January 1. Aetos Capital formalized the Aetos Capital Credit and Distressed Opportunities Portfolio in October 2011. The performance figures shown for periods prior to October 2011 are those of the Aetos Capital Funds comprising the Aetos Capital Credit and Distressed Opportunities Portfolio, weighted according to the allocations on October 1, 2011. During the period from September 2002 through October 2011, it is possible that the Aetos Capital Credit and Distressed Opportunities Portfolio allocations to the Aetos Capital Funds would have differed from the allocations on October 1, 2011, and the performance shown is not necessarily representative of the performance that would have been achieved had the Aetos Capital Credit and Distressed Opportunities Portfolio been in existence during the entire period. The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser. Returns would have been lower without such waivers and reimbursements. Past performance is not indicative of future returns.

The prospectus contains this and other information; a free copy of the prospectus may be obtained by calling 212-201-2540. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

6Investment Performance:                                                        

Performance figures shown are net of investment advisory and performance fees   
of 1.00% of assets annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury   
bill return, respectively, the maximum level of fees charged by Aetos to any    
account.  The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been 
waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Adviser.  Returns would have been    
lower without such waivers and reimbursements.  Past performance is not indica- 
tive of future returns.                                                         

Absolute return investing involves substantial risks, including the risk of loss
of invested capital.  Absolute return investments are typically made through    
investments in illiquid, unregulated investment funds that employ sophisticated 
investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range
of financial instruments and markets.  These investments entail a wide variety  
of risks, which remain substantial notwithstanding the risk management practices
we employ in selecting and monitoring funds we invest in.                       

Prospective investors should consider these risks, and the charges and expenses 
discussed above carefully before investing.  The prospectus contains this and   
other information; a free copy of the prospectus may be obtained by calling     
212-201-2540.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.

	Introductory Statement



	 








	This final amendment to the Issuer Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2013 by Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the “Fund”) relating to an offer to purchase up to $15,000,000 of limited liability company interests of the Fund (“Interests”) or portions thereof from members of the Fund (the “Members”) at their net asset value (that is, the value of the Fund’s assets minus its liabilities, multiplied by the proportionate interest in the Fund which a Member desires to redeem), on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal.  Copies of the Offer to Purchase and the Letter of Transmittal were previously filed as Exhibits B and C to the Statement on March 1, 2013.









	This is the final amendment to the Statement and is being filed to report the results of the Offer.  The following information is furnished pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended:









	1.           Members that desired to tender an Interest, or a portion of an Interest, were required to submit their tenders by 12:00 midnight, New York time, on March 31, 2013.  Members were allowed to withdraw any tenders of their Interests or portions thereof until the Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York time, on March 31, 2013, and, if Interests had not then been accepted by the Fund, at any time after March 31, 2013.









	2.           Certain members validly tendered all or a portion of their Interests, designated by the members as $10,416,878.17 in the aggregate, prior to March 31, 2013 and did not withdraw such tenders prior to March 31, 2013.  Those tenders were accepted for purchase by the Fund in accordance with the terms of the offer.









	3.           The net asset value of the Interests or portion thereof tendered pursuant to the offer was calculated as of March 31, 2013.









	4.           The payment of the purchase price of the Interests or portions thereof tendered was made on April 26, 2013 to the Members whose tenders were accepted for purchase by the Fund in accordance with the terms of the Offer.







	SIGNATURE









	After due inquiry and to the best of my knowledge, I certify that the information set forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.
