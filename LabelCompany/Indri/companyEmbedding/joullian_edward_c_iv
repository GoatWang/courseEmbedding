A prestigious community tradition, the Beaux Arts Ball Saturday evening was a stately display of pageantry and ceremony.
Edward C. Joullian III, crowned king of the ball, reigned over his court in the Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club, where 25 girls made their formal debuts.
Ball proceeds benefit the Oklahoma Art Center's acquisition fund, which is used to buy artwork for the museum.
A king is chosen annually for his exemplary achievements and contributions to the community.  Wearing the sash and official medallion of the Beaux Arts Society, Joullian was dressed in tails for his regal entrance.
Following an 8:30 supper, the formal ceremonies began with the ringing of 41 chimes to open the 41st annual ball.
Gene Dillehay made the traditional announcement: "Let there be due respect afforded the royal court."
In pairs, 19 former kings walked through the club's Great Hall to the Cypress room where they joined their wives at assigned tables.
Fanfare continued with the parading of the king's flag.
Joullian, whose identity was to be a secret until that night, entered from the Cypress room and walked to the end of the Great Hall.
Mounted on a platform, his throne was backed by white linen, pleated fabric and flanked by moss-covered topiary trees covered in white flowers.
Debutantes paired with escorts entered and made formal bows to the king and then walked through the ballroom to take their places on risers flanking the king's throne.
Dressed in long white dresses and carrying bouquets of white roses, white gerber daisies, white fresia and ming fern, the young women were introduced individually by songs they had selected.
Joullian then joined his wife on the dance floor for the first dance of the evening.  The debutantes followed with their fathers as dance partners.  The Manhattan Skyline Orchestra of Fort Worth, Texas, provided the music.
Chairman of this year's ball was Mrs. N. Phillip Truss III;
co-chairman was Mrs. James H. Everest.
The 25 debutantes and their parents are:   Nicole Amundsen, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jerry William Amundsen;
Ashley Elizabeth Arnold, daughter of Mrs. Guy Kiker and Dr. Robert Carlton Arnold;
Megan Balyeat, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Hal Davison Balyeat;
Virginia Lane Cathcart, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William Richard Cathcart II;
Kathryn Elizabeth Coleman, daughter of Mrs. Marcus LaFayette Cox and Jack Hughes Coleman;
Nancy Lynn Davis, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Franklin Davis;
Susan Kay deCordova, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Willingham deCordova;
Angela Joy Dobry, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Neil Allen Dobry;
Katherine Ann Duncan, daughter of Katherine Morse Duncan and James Walter Duncan III;
Melissa Ann Flesher, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. David Armstead Flesher;
Ashley Gail Hall, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Leo Hall Jr.;
Ann-Marie Henry, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Armstrong Henry III;
Eleanor Gentry Holloway, daughter of Judge and Mrs. William Judson Holloway Jr.;
Laura Dyanne Kerr, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Samuel Kerr Jr.;
Kristin Kathleen Long, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Wendall McClean Long Jr.;
Jennifer Lee McKee, daughter of Mrs. James Melton Wadley and John Raleigh McKee;
Sarah Jane McKinney, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Neville McKinney;
Susan Elizabeth Morrison, daughter of Marilyn Swan Morrison and Charles Davis Morrison;
Stacy Suzanne Nelson, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Jay Calvin Nelson;
Amy Jeanne O'Neil, daughter of Patty Lautze O'Neil and Daniel Michael O'Neil Jr.;
Laura Elaine Paul, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William George Paul;
Ann Morley Rockett, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Donald Joe Rockett;
Elizabeth Connell Sullivan, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Mark Stover Sullivan;
Dawn Marie Taylor, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Alan Taylor;
Elizabeth Nelson Tolbert, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James R. Tolbert III.
Born in 1929 in Blackwell, Joullian completed his primary education in the public schools there and attended high school in the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell.
He was graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in mechanical engineering and served as a commanding oficer of Petroleum Products Laboratory during the Korean War.
Now, he serves as president and board chairman of Mustang Energy Corp. and its subsidiaries, and is director of the American Fidelity Cos. and its subsidiaries, Fleming Cos. and the LTV Corp. in Dallas.
He is a trustee of the Oklahoma Industrial Authority and serves on numerous civic boards.
"I have supported a variety of worthwhile community activities and organizations through the years, but the Boy Scouts remain my primary special interest," Joullian said.
"The investments we make in our young people, especially through youth organizations like Scouting, result in great dividends.
"The Boy Scouts promulgate a value system based upon the Scout oath and Scout law that helps instill in young people the qualities necessary to make responsible, ethical decisions as young people and adults.
"Oklahoma is fortunate to have Scout leaders who believe in this value system and strive to instill it in our young people who are involved in Scouting."
Joullian is an executive board member of the Boy Scouts of America, Irving, Texas, and the Last Frontier Council of Boy Scouts of America in Oklahoma City.
He also serves as international commissioner for the Boy Scouts of America, is a trustee of the World Scout Foundation in Geneva, Switzerland, and vice chairman of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce.
In addition, he is vice chairman and director of the State Fair of Oklahoma, president of the board of governors of Oklahoma Christian College, national chairman of the New Mexico Military Institute Centennial Commission, director of the city chapter of National Conference on Jews, and director of American Humanics Inc., Kansas City, Mo.   He is a member of the Oak Tree Golf Club, the Whitehall Club and past director of the Oklahoma City Golf and Country Club.
He has been honored with the Bronze Wolf Award;  the Silver Buffalo Award;  the Oklahoma State University Distinguished Alumnus Award;
inclusion in the OSU Hall of Fame;  the Henry G. Bennett Distinguished Service Award; the OSU College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology Hall of Fame Award, and inclusion in the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.
Joullian, past president of American Fidelity Cox., served as board chairman of First National Bank and Trust Co., as board chairman and chief executive officer of First Oklahoma Bancorporation Inc., as president of the board of trustees of Casady School, and as president of the Oklahoma City Community Foundation.
He said he believes business leaders can contribute to economic development.
"Both business leaders and the private sector need to contribute toward an attitude of cooperation and teamwork where everyone works together for the same goals," Joullian said.
"We need to work to build on our present economic base, both large and small employers.  There must be a philosophy of teamwork in both public and private sectors.
"I see a gradual improvement in petroleum and agriculture, but not in the immediate future  probably late 1987 or thereafter."
The Joullians, who live in Nichols Hills, have two children, Marion and Carey.
Serving on the ball committee were Mrs. Fenton Sanger, Mrs. James A. White, Mrs. Frank X. Olney Jr., Mrs. John Armstrong Henry IV, Mrs. Robert Browne, Mrs. Brooks Hall Jr. and Mrs. R.E. Haydel.
Also, Mrs. Johnson Hightower, Susan Currie, Mrs. Michael Mahaffey, Mrs. Edward Cook, Mrs. Ted Elam, Mrs. Jack Gers, Mrs. Richard Norville and Mrs. Richard Van Cleef.
And, Mrs. Mark H. Pierce, Mrs. Mike Samis, Mrs. Richard T. Austin Jr., Mrs. Peter Hoffman, Mrs. H.E. Boecking III, Mrs. Robert T. Douglass and Mrs. Claude Beeler Jr.   And, Mrs. James B. Kite Jr., Mrs. Robert Sullivan, Mrs. Morton Payne III, Mrs. Hal D. Balyeat, Mrs. K.T. Meade Jr., Mrs. Richard Workman, Mrs. Edward Soule, Mrs. Ron James and Mrs. Nick Duncan.
The debutantes' escorts were William Bondurant, William Coleman, Gregory Gray, Roy Love III, Scott McLain, David Mueller, John Parsons, William Coyle, John Markley Jr., William Payne, Barry Rooker, David Bohanon, Phillip Bohanon and David Bozalis.
Also, David Coffeen, James Duncan, Blake Evans, Richard Harrison Jr., Thomas Jordan Jr., James Keller, John Marshall, Christopher Mills, Robert Mothershed, Jeffery Stewart and Harris Van Cleef.
