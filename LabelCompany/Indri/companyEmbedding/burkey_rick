History  –  Burkey Construction Co.

History


Mission and Values






 
History 

In 1946, Grant Burkey started a journey that changed his life. He formed a small residential construction company, designing and building small homes in Ephrata, PA. It wasn’t long before he had an opportunity to enter the commercial construction market near Reading, PA. That slight direction change was the start of one of the leading construction firms in the Reading and Berks County area. Working primarily as a general contractor, larger and more significant projects were completed and relationships were established that have endured generations.
As the Reading and Berks economy grew, Burkey Construction Co. participated in the growth with some of the county’s most notable companies such as Western Electric, Gilbert Associates, Met-Ed, and Boscov’s Department Store.
In 1969, after graduation from Lehigh University and military service, Rick Burkey joined the firm with the goal of father and son taking the company to the next level.
Throughout the next three decades Burkey played a major role in building many of the more significant buildings in Reading and Berks County, to include the Exide Building, Penn Square Center, Penske Plaza, The Wachovia Regional Headquarters, GoggleWorks Center for the Arts, Sovereign Plaza and the Gateway Office Building. Historic restorations to some of Reading’s most prominent buildings were completed, such as the former Berkshire and Abraham Lincoln Hotels, and the Meridian Bank Operations Center.
Not to be omitted from the list are the many educational, institutional, and public projects that were also built throughout these decades. During this time as the market grew, Burkey’s services expanded into construction management, design-build, and real estate development. As a result of the pursuit of customer service, quality construction, and dedication to the community, Burkey Construction Co. has been fortunate to be one of the leading contractors in the Reading and Berks County area.
As Burkey Construction Co. begins the next century; the excitement, enthusiasm, and dedication are still as pertinent as when Grant Burkey wrote his first contract. Especially gratifying is to see Eric Burkey, the third generation, joining the firm. With six years of previous experience with a major national contracting firm, Eric is a valuable asset to Burkey’s future.
As a local family-owned business, Burkey Construction is proud to serve Berks and surrounding counties and pledges to continue its passion to provide craftsmanship, quality and dedication in serving its clients and community.

Great Bag












Verified Purchase


Terrific travel bag to go with in the cabin of the plane. Good room, outside pockets, and tie down straps in side.

Good quality bag with maximized space












I got this bag 2 years bag with the intention of maximizing space to carry the bag on-board without checking-in. It has been 2 years of no regrets. The build is sturdy to throw around especially the 2 carrying handles.

However, i am suspicious of the shoulder strap- this is easily fixed with a hack of running another strap through the bottom of the bag so that the strap supports the entire weight of the bag. Now the only hack i need to do is for the backpack straps. 

I bring along a tiny foldable trolley which i keep inside the bag when i travel so that i can use it if i get too tired. Of course the bag flips over if you pack unevenly.

Really happy with it!!

Easy Travel

We bought 2 of these bags for a trip to Europe and used them as our only luggage. I was able to put 30 lbs of things in mine and carry it everywhere. The bag is great and was the best bag we could find for the price.

Great Carry-on!












Verified Purchase


We bought this bag to use for a carry on for a trip to Mexico.  I had no trouble packing in enough clothes for 2 weeks, and had room to bring quite a few souvenirs home thanks to the expandable zipper.  The large front pocket made it easy to pull out my zip-lock bag of toiletries for security inspection and pop it back in quickly.  Having so many zippered compartments made it easy to organize.  The straps were comfortable for backpacking it, though I didn't have to carry my luggage very far, just through busy airports.  I would recommend this bag to anyone who wants to travel light.  The only downside is that it is so roomy that you might be tempted to over pack!

Love it












Verified Purchase


Ordered the bag for a trip to Europe after reading lots of reviews from different web sites. The bag arrived within a week and looks great. Lots of pockets and well-thought-out design. My husband wants one now...I may give him my "spruce" one and order the copper color, but the spruce is very nice.

perfect!












Verified Purchase


After an airline lost my checked bag, I vowed only to take carry-on for flights. I bought Rick Steves carry-on bag for a week-long trip across the country, and it was perfect! Everything I needed fit; it complied with regulations and fit in overhead bins; and I love that you can carry it three ways. Also, all the zippered compartments are useful, and the fact that it doesn't have wheels makes it lighter and easier to fit (smash!) into smaller spaces.I highly recommend it!

Ready to travel....












Verified Purchase


This Rick Steves bag is just what I was looking for.  Extremely well made with lots of pockets, zippers and extra features like hidden backpack straps and waist strap.  This will be my only piece of luggage for a 22-day trip to England.  Plenty of room for all that I need to take with me.

Great bag












Verified Purchase


I had heard and read many good things about this bag and with an upcoming trip to Europe decided to order it.  It arrived very quickly and was exactly as represented.  It seems very sturdy and well made with attention to detail.  There are many pockets and lots of flexibility with this bag.  The color choices are nice and the compression straps are nice too.  If I had one hesitation, it would be that there are so many outside zippers that it is difficult to lock it on the outside.  It would require more than one lock to try to secure the contents of the pockets.  I would not want to lock it in every situation but in some places we will be traveling, having the ability to lock it would be a good and necessary thing.

Excellent product












Verified Purchase


This is the second Rick Steves Convertible Carry-On I've purchased. My son liked his so much, that I got one for my daughter's first extended trip to Europe. My son is an aficionado of crazy amounts of hidden compartments, pockets, zippers, straps, etc., and this piece of luggage passed his muster with flying colors. It really is a practical and excellently made piece of luggage.

So far so good












Verified Purchase


Just bought the bag to use for my airplane carry on for a week long vacation. Worked great, I didn't use the expansion zipper because of the size limitations, but even with the basic volume got everything I needed inside. Only thing is that the bag is a bit floppy - sags when not full so weight shifts around  a bit when its over your shoulder. But I like the fact there are  no wheels, the bag itself weighs almost nothing, and I liked the configuration of the   front pockets a lot. 
Didn't use it as a backpack, but used the waist straps to wrap around the front to cinch the bag tight.

Perfect!

This product is everything I expected it to be.  Can't wait to travel with it!

light traveler












I am a petite woman and was fearful it might be too big for me as a backpack, but if it is not overstuffed it works very well.  I bought this for a carry on in addition to the 21" roll aboard.  Will really be putting it to the test over the next several months as I travel across country a few times and then to Greece.

Very heavy duty , thick fabric and well made zippers. I like the pocket set up as well. No regrets.

Great Bag












This is a great bag for the casual traveler. It is very well made with quality materials and it is as or more durable than many packs/bags costing much more. The pockets are well designed and the entire bag is well thought out. Like all of the Rick Steves products I have purchased over the years, I am very happy with this bag. It has been to Europe quite a few times with me and still looks like new. I sometimes check the bag and sometimes it's a carry-on (depending one how much I am carrying and the airline), with absolutely no problems with the conveyor systems.While I don't believe that this pack is a substitute for a dedicated internal or external frame pack for serious or professional trekkers or climbers, Rick does not purport it to be that. There is no actual frame and the shoulder straps and waist straps don't transfer weight like some of the more expensive ($250+) packs. However, those packs don't have the versatility of this Rick Steves pack/bag. This bag has both vertical and horizontal hand grips; a separate shoulder strap is available; both the waist belt and shoulder straps are concealable; finally, it is a comfortable backpack with well-padded shoulder straps. All of that plus being both expandable and having cinch straps make the bag hard to beat. I usually carry about 25-35 lbs without difficulty and the pack is not full. Buy one.

Awesome Bag!












Verified Purchase


Based strictly on reviews from all over the web, my husband & I each purchased the Rick Steves Convertible Carry-on Bag for use on our 2 week trip to New Zealand.After returning from our trip, I can honestly say if you are thinking about this bag, ORDER IT!! You can't go wrong with this bag: It is stylish, spacious, and has many different compartments, so you can really separate your things. Also, it fit as a carry-on on every flight we took. Having this bag made my life so much easier while traveling, something I never thought I would say about a piece of luggage!Per my hubby:

Can't Wait To Travel!












Verified Purchase


I debated on several different travel backpack carry-ons- patagonia, eagle creek, etc. I kept coming back to the Rick Steves pack, due to the lower price and similar features. I thought this pack would feel a little 'less' impressive and was delighted that the materials were more solid than expected for this price. I haven't traveled yet with this pack but expect it to hold up well as a carry on. I'm not sure I would check it through. I was pleased that the bag came with a shoulder strap (duffel bag style) as well as the back pack straps. Can't wait for Europe!

Great Suitcase!












Verified Purchase


I bought this bag for a trip to Europe and I could not have been any happier! It was light and easy to wear as a backpack. It also came with a shoulder strap which came in handy. I loved the many accessible pockets. It was also fun to travel with a Rick Steves bag knowing how respected he is in the travel industry!

Water purifiers & filters by Berkey
The Big Berkey water purifier and the full line of Berkey water filters use proprietary Black Berkey purifier elements to achieve an incredible 99.99999% reduction of contaminants. Independent lab testing proves removal of not only pathogenic bacteria, but even organisms as small as viruses—a level of performance unmatched by other systems. This extreme purification, called “7 log” reduction, means that not more than one part per ten million of the contaminant remains in your water. This standard is 1000X higher than what's needed to label a system as a simple “water filter.” These exceptional purifiers provide ultra-pure water in circumstances of extreme contamination. They're electricity-free, the elements are cleanable, and each element can clean up to 3000 gallons of water of pathogenic organisms and harmful chemicals. The full stainless-housing line includes the Crown, Imperial, Big, Travel, and Royal Berkey water purifiers. All work by gravity so they're portable for use indoors or outdoors. The Berkey Light system uses the same unique filter media in an unbreakable transparent housing. Sport bottles offer personal filtration you can carry with you anywhere. Click a model below to read about the most powerful and reliable water purifiers on the planet.

 Water Purifier Replacement Parts 

Water purifier replacement parts include replacement water purifier elements, standard spigots, spare parts kits, and ceramic filter elements that can be used with Berkey or British Berkefeld water purifiers. Stainless steel British Berkefeld systems using ceramic filter candles have provided safe, clean drinking water in remote areas of the globe for many years. In both British Berkefelnd and Black Berkey-equipped systems including the Big Berkey purifiers, you can choose how many filter elements you want to install. The more purifier elements (also called candles or filters) that are installed, the more gallons per hour of flow rate will be achieved. Larger water purifiers have ports for more elements, and the smaller systems have fewer ports. Unused ports are blocked with removable rubber plugs.

 Water Purifier Replacement Parts 

Water purifier replacement parts include replacement water purifier elements, standard spigots, spare parts kits, and ceramic filter elements that can be used with Berkey or British Berkefeld water purifiers. Stainless steel British Berkefeld systems using ceramic filter candles have provided safe, clean drinking water in remote areas of the globe for many years. In both British Berkefelnd and Black Berkey-equipped systems including the Big Berkey purifiers, you can choose how many filter elements you want to install. The more purifier elements (also called candles or filters) that are installed, the more gallons per hour of flow rate will be achieved. Larger water purifiers have ports for more elements, and the smaller systems have fewer ports. Unused ports are blocked with removable rubber plugs.

Water Purifiers



Water purifiers & filters by Berkey
The Big Berkey water purifier and the full line of Berkey water filters use proprietary Black Berkey purifier elements to achieve an incredible 99.99999% reduction of contaminants. Independent lab testing proves removal of not only pathogenic bacteria, but even organisms as small as viruses—a level of performance unmatched by other systems. This extreme purification, called “7 log” reduction, means that not more than one part per ten million of the contaminant remains in your water. This standard is 1000X higher than what's needed to label a system as a simple “water filter.” These exceptional purifiers provide ultra-pure water in circumstances of extreme contamination. They're electricity-free, the elements are cleanable, and each element can clean up to 3000 gallons of water of pathogenic organisms and harmful chemicals. The full stainless-housing line includes the Crown, Imperial, Big, Travel, and Royal Berkey water purifiers. All work by gravity so they're portable for use indoors or outdoors. The Berkey Light system uses the same unique filter media in an unbreakable transparent housing. Sport bottles offer personal filtration you can carry with you anywhere. Click a model below to read about the most powerful and reliable water purifiers on the planet.
