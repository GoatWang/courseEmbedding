Global Fashion Technologies, Inc Announces Purchase of New Mexico Facility 
Global To Employ 300 People in Belen, NM Facility

Sante Fe Springs, CA, Oct. 31, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Fashion Technologies, Inc (OTC: GFTI) is very pleased to
announced that it has purchased a 40 acre site including a 165,000
sq ft manufacturing facility in Belen New Mexico. Global is
partnering with Pure Systems International, LTD to create and
operate a new state of the art Textile Fiber Rejuvenation plant at
this location.
New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez welcomed Global and Pure to
New Mexico while speaking at a dedication ceremony on Tuesday
October 28. "Global Fashion Technologies is a forward-thinking,
environmentally-conscious company that we are thrilled to have in
our state creating jobs and exporting goods all over the world,"
said Governor Martinez. "We have significantly improved our
business climate to specifically recruit
manufacturing businesses like this to our state."
"Initial prep work on the building itself has already started"
stated Joy Nunn, CEO of Pure Systems International. "Our unique,
energy efficient production equipment is scheduled for installation
very soon and we are on track to start shipping finished goods in
Spring of 2015. That means we will start the hiring process in
first quarter with expected employment levels to surpass 300 people
when we hit full production in the facility."
"Our Research and Development efforts at Pure have yielded
significant advancements in our base technology over the last few
years" discussed Paul Serbiak, Managing Partner of Pure Systems.
"The next generation fibers and fiber blends produced in our new
state of the art facility will offer our customers superior
performance to virgin fiber and to previous generations of our own
technology."
"These are very important steps that confirm our commitment of
creating and delivering better consumer products through
sustainable innovative methods of manufacturing" said Tom Witthuhn,
CEO of Global. "Our technologies and production methodologies
deliver the strongest sustainability message in the market. In
addition to the positive impact of rejuvenating raw materials that
would normally be headed to landfills or incinerators, we can
legitimately lay claim to immense water conservation. In fact, it
would take over 500 billion gallons of water to grow an equal
amount of cotton to the annual fiber output of this Rejuvenation
facility," he added.
Chris H Giordano Co Chairman of Global stated "Having an
opportunity to work with the State of New Mexico is in my opinion a
pre-cursor of other similar opportunities to come as we move
further down the road. Utilizing our patented technology coupled
with the capital and the aggressive incentive programs that are
being offered to Global by our suitors will not only create a
substantial  job base in the communities we work with, but
will also potentially create substantial profit for our company
going forward. 
Sustainable products is a very large silo of opportunity for us
since it at the top of the list of the most important things that
CEOS of Fortune 500 companies are concentrating on according to
research that was done by Verdantix.


http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/04/23/spotlight-on-the-hows-and-whys-of-sustainable-products/

This paradigm shift in corporate policy positions us right in
the middle of the vast sustainable fiber need of many major
consumer product companies.
We have a world class group of intelligent, relentless and
diligent people in Tom Witthuhn, Joy Nunn and Paul Serbiak. Couple
that with an ability to get the financing necessary to open up
facilities globally we are extremely excited for the potential that
the future holds for our shareholders.
We thank them and the great State of New Mexico and its citizens
for their support of what will be a long term partnership between
our company their State.

Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. (GFTI) Announces The Addition Of Key Executives
Global Fashion Technologies, Inc. (OTC: GFTI) announces the addition of two key executives, K. Joy Nunn and Paul Serbiak



















April 22, 2015 09:30 ET

 | Source: EcoTek360, Inc.





Santa Fe Springs, CA, April 22, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Joy Nunn, CEO of Pure Systems International, LTD., a California
based innovator in sustainable textile engineering and application,
has agreed to become the Chief Technology Officer and board member
of Global Fashion Technologies, Inc .
Ms. Nunn is a pioneer and continues to pioneer the rejuvenation
of excess textile materials for integration into upper-end
commercial and retail applications.
Ms. Nunn has successfully developed patents which cover both the
organic treatment and engineering process of the raw materials. Ms.
Nunn's patents for the organic treatment and engineering of
materials capitalize upon a sustainability model that slashes the
intensive use of natural resources required for first generation
fibers and fabrics.
The result of this groundbreaking technology has been textile
fibers which are longer, stronger and more efficient in the
manufacture process than are virgin materials.
Paul Serbiak, a former Global VP of Consumer Products with
Johnson & Johnson and current COO of Pure Systems
International, has agreed to become Global's Chief Operating
Officer and board member. Mr. Serbiak will now provide to Global
his 35 years of broad experience in the areas consumer products, R
& D and engineering.
The "Pure System" takes scrap materials and rejuvenates them
into pure, technically advanced fibers that can be fabricated once
again into re-usable products. The Pure process helps our client
companies and fiber product manufacturers operate sustainably
rather than sending their scrap material to the landfill or
incinerator."
Chris H Giordano, Global's President added, "We welcome both Joy
and Paul to our company and the opportunity to now bring to Globa
shareholders a fully rounded world class management team.
Sustainability is a key focus of the CEO's of the worlds largest
corporations and our management team has the expertise to help us
take full advantage of this tremendous opportunity within that
focus. It is with great anticipation that we now move forward to
set a standard of excellence and  to have Global make a mark
in the rapidly growing world of sustainability with our "high tech
fiber" products.
We will also be releasing our year end report and first quarter
report simultaneously in the very near future. It is anticipated
that the 1st quarter report will show a near total
elimination of our former liabilities. This will now allow Global
to have a fresh start with a one of a kind business initiative,
without the overhang of the former company's balance sheet.
We look forward with excitement to our next communication with
you our shareholders."
About Global Fashion Technologies, Inc: Global Fashion
Technologies, Inc is a global sustainability company specializing
in the manufacturing and distribution of rejuvenated fiber
products.
About Pure System International LTD: Pure System International
LTD is a global technology and management company, the global
leader in Rejuvenation technology, specializing in the analysis,
mobilization and transformation of the world's largest waste
streams.

Global Fashion Technologies Inc Enters The Activewear Market with Supermodel EMME

Global Fashion Technologies Inc. (OTC: GFTI) in conjunction with Supermodel EMME to release an EMME branded line of activewear.
/EIN News/ -- Parsippany,NJ, Feb.  17, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Parsippany, New Jersey, Feb. 17, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global Fashion Technologies Inc. (OTC: GFTI) is pleased to announce it has completed a license agreement with EMME, the market pioneer and trusted voice of the “Full-Figured” market. Under this licensing agreement GFTI, will design, produce and market the EMME® Activewear Collection to the grossly under-served 100 million women representing the 67% of full figured women within the US and Canada.
“EMME will be a “Trail Blazer” in the Full-Figured Activewear Category. This strategic agreement supports our overall corporate commitment to the active apparel segment” said Chris Giordano, Chairman and President of Global. It provides us with the strength to truly address the nearly forgotten needs of two thirds of the US women’s market that fall within the full-figured category. Utilizing EMME’s celebrity status whom is considered to be the ambassador of the full-figured category will allow us to address the market with a highly credible brand that speaks to all woman. EMME's reputation, accomplishments and history resonates with women across the entire spectrum no matter what their size is. The recent decision for Sports Illustrated to feature full-figured Ashley Graham on the cover of one of the three “Swimsuit” issues brings true focus and testament to the category's importance for both its beauty and relevance. http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/model-emme-talks-body-positive-revolution-36940570 With the release of the EMME activewear line we look to reinvent the science of fit. We start the design process with the average female size – US size 12-16 while considering the diversity of the female form. We then grade up and down each size, shape, and proportion to create the absolute best fit and style for all women.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report as well as our Report on Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the period ending December 31, 2014. Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements". These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.  Company Overview  Global Fashion Technologies Inc. ("GFTI", 'We" or the "Company") is a development stage rejuvenation technology company which will be offering branded fabrics, apparel and uniforms to the corporate, hotel, hospital and military markets. We will achieve this by utilizing a patented and proprietary process for rejuvenating textile waste into high quality fabrics and apparel. In addition, we will also be offering branded apparel into both online and brick and mortar environments. This will initially be through a license we signed with EMME(R), a former Ford Supermodel, for the purposes of marketing and manufacturing the EMME(R) brand of Activewear to the vastly under-served curvy/plus size market.  The Women's Apparel Segment  On March 15, 2015 the Company entered into a trademark license agreement with True Beauty, LLC which controls the trademark EMME(R) . EMME(R) is a market pioneer and trusted voice of the "Full-Figured" market. Under this licensing agreement the Company will design, produce and market the EMME(R) Activewear Collection.  As of November 1, 2016, the Company has completed the design of the Spring 2017 line and has received quotes from contract manufacturers. Samples for fitting have been requested from the selected vendors. The Fall 2017 line concept has been created and is now ready to enter into design phase.  The Rejuvenated Uniform Segment  In April 2015, we entered into a joint venture and license agreement with Pure Systems International, Ltd. to produce and market garments and other accessories for the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals by utilizing Pure Systems International, Ltd.'s patented processes to up-cycle pre-consumer textile waste into reusable fiber of equal or better quality than the original fabric. (the "Rejuvenated Fiber")  In May of 2015, the Company created a new limited liability company, Pure361, LLC ("Pure361") of which the Company owns 51% and Pure Systems International, Ltd. owns 49%. Pure361 has the exclusive licensee to use Pure System International Ltd.'s patented Rejuvenated Fiber in conjunction with the commercial uniform marketplace and other market verticals.  The Rejuvenated Cardboard Segment  In conjunction with its focus on rejuvenated technologies, the Company is exploring the possibility of also manufacturing a rejuvenated cardboard product, and is in the early stages of exploring this potential opportunity.  Trident Merchant Group, Inc.  Trident Merchant Group, Inc. is an operating subsidiary which is a "value added" strategic advisory services company specializing in rendering expertise in the areas of capital planning and procurement, licensing and branding as well as financial engineering and restructuring of its client company's balance sheet and going public process.  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Material Changes in Financial Condition  As of September 30, 2015, our current assets were $40,938 as compared to $755 in current assets as of December 31, 2014.  As of September 30, 2015, our current liabilities were $1,726,411 as compared to $2,974,036 in current liabilities as of December 31, 2014. This change in the Company's financial condition was primarily related to R.R. Donnelly & Sons Company note which was acquired by a director and converted on March 1, 2015 into 6,062,154 shares of the Company's common stock. On March 1, 2015 the principal and accrued interest in the amount of $931,306 related to the R.R. Donnelly & Sons Company note was converted into 6,062,154 shares of common stock of the Company. As a result of this conversion, the $931,306 liability due to "secured note and accrued interest payable - related party" that existed as of December 14, 2014, was reduced to $0 as of September 30, 2015. In addition, two officers accrued wages of $340,000 as of December 31, 2014 were converted to 2.5 million shares of common stock at $1.25 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, reducing the accrued compensation from $340,000 to $0 as of September 30, 2015.  Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $236,413 compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 of $74,864. Cash provided by or used by operating activities is driven by our net loss and adjusted by non-cash items as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. Non-cash adjustments primarily include debt extinguishment cost, failed acquisition noncash expense, discontinued operation expense, stock compensation expense, stock issued for services, and participation share compensation. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $19,303,691 was essentially offset by these non-cash adjustments totaling $19,118,844. Changes in assets and liabilities provided an offset to the non-cash expenses of $51,566.  Net cash flows used in investing activities consisted of $2,650 in additions to property and equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $25,899 and an additional $32,000 in other investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  Net cash provided by financing activities of $240,496 for the nine month period ending September 30, 2015 was primarily due to $198,000 paid to the Company from the sale of common stock, proceeds received from the issuance of a $50,000 note payable and advances from a related party of $19,150, offset by payment of $26,654 to a related party for an advance.  We are currently dependent upon receiving loans from our shareholders. We expect to raise additional capital to continue moving the Company towards profitability.  The Company does not currently have any substantial revenues, and is reliant on its ability to raise additional capital to continue execution of its business plan to move the Company forward towards profitability.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014  The Company experienced a net loss of $272,729 in the third quarter of 2015 compared to net loss of $33,722 in the third quarter of 2014. This change was primarily due to the issuance of 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $200,000 to a former executive of the company per due to the execution of a separation agreement. The remaining change was due to a change in other operating expenses of $39,007.  General and administrative costs increased to $71,094 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $25,194 for the three months ended September 30, 2014. This increase of $45,900 is a result of an increase in third quarter operating expenses from 2014 to 2015.  Interest expense was $6,676 and $6,677 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company had a loss from discontinued operations of $213 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared $1,851 for the three months ended September 30, 2014.  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $907 for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The entity which owned the non-controlling interest of Leading Edge Fashions, LLC became incapable of funding their share of the losses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014, and therefore, the minority interest from December 31, 2014 was charged to discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, 1,710,000 shares of common stock were issued at $1.25 per share for additional losses from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014  The Company experienced a net loss of $19,303,691 in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to net loss of $462,879 in nine months ended September 30, 2014. This change was primarily due to the settlement of $340,000 of accrued salary through the issuances of 2,500,000 shares of common stock resulting in an extinguishment of debt in the amount of $2,785,000. The R.R. Donnelly & Sons Company note acquired by a director and converted into common stock which resulted in a debt extinguishment cost of $8,465,034, failed acquisition expense of $1,932,265, of which $1,892,270 was related to common stock issued for expenses incurred related to the failed acquisition. The Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock valued at $1,250,000 as sign-on bonuses to two key employees (500,000 shares each) and 287,500 shares of common stock valued at $359,375 to the Company's board members for their services. The Company issued 1,211,248 shares of its common stock valued at $1,514,060 to an individual for participation expenses. The Company also issued 200,000 shares of common stock valued at $200,000 related to an employee stock settlement, and issued 71,426 shares of common stock valued at $89,283 for consulting services. In addition, there was a decrease in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014. While the Company's revenue was $334,257 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, it was $4,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This reduction in revenue in for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is due to the fact that a majority of the revenue received in the first and second quarters of 2014 related to one-time payments for consulting services.  General and administrative costs were reduced to $128,611 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $334,257 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This reduction of $205,646 is a result of a decrease in first nine months operating expenses from 2014 to 2015.  Research and development costs were $0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $5,789 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.  Interest expense was $20,028 and $20,030 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax increased to $2,564,035 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from $470,816 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The $2,564,035 incurred in the first half of 2015 was related to additional costs of Leading Edge Fashions, LLC.  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $230,700 for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The entity which owned the non-controlling interest of Leading Edge Fashions, LLC became incapable of funding their share of the losses incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014, and therefore, the minority interest from December 31, 2014 was charged to discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, 1,710,000 shares of common stock were issued at $1.25 per share for additional losses from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
