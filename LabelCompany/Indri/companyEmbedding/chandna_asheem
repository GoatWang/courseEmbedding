Our Investment in Obsidian Security – Greylock PerspectivesFollowSign in / Sign upGreylock PartnersBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingWe are company builders and investors. We partner with consumer and enterprise software entrepreneurs. Follow us here: http://t.co/7CHHt0R4Jun 8Obsidian co-founders Matt Wolff, Glenn Chisholm, and Ben JohnsonOur Investment in Obsidian SecurityBy Asheem Chandna and Sarah GuoSecurity is a large, growing concern in our digital, connected world. As data and applications move into hybrid cloud environments, the surface area that enterprises need to protect continues to increase in both complexity and size. Employees, contractors and partners require dynamic access that keeps up with the pace of their business, and enterprises need security offerings that are more automated and require less work from defenders to fit this new reality. Greylock has been fortunate to work closely with a distinguished list of innovative security companies over the years, including Palo Alto Networks, Okta, Imperva and OpenDNS; and more recently with Skyhigh Networks, Awake Networks, and Cato Networks. Today, we are announcing that Greylock has led the series A in Obsidian Security and both of us (Asheem Chandna and Sarah Guo) have joined the Board. We are excited about Obsidian for a few reasons: the team, the space, and their approach.World-Class Founding TeamThe Obsidian founders are accomplished product innovators and seasoned security practitioners. Glenn Chisholm (CEO and co-founder) was previously the CTO of Cylance, where he led the company’s product management and engineering teams. Prior to Cylance, Glenn served as the first CISO of Telstra. Ben Johnson (CTO and co-founder) previously co-founded Carbon Black where he also served as CTO. Prior to Carbon Black, Ben was a practitioner at the NSA and CIA. Matt Wolff (Chief Scientist and co-founder) was previously the Chief Data Scientist at Cylance, and earlier also served at the NSA. Products that Glenn, Ben and Matt previously helped design, develop and deliver are now deployed across thousands of enterprise customers. We’ve known Glenn for several years as an important industry innovator and more recently got to know Ben and Matt. A few whiteboard sessions, some dinners, and bunch of enterprise customer conversations deepened our already strong interest in working with the Obsidian team. We are grateful for the opportunity to go on this journey with them, as founding investors in their new company.Large and Growing Problem SpaceGlobal spend on IT security products and services is estimated to be ~$70B today, and is expected to double over the next five years. Obsidian will help customers address a soft belly of enterprise security — user account security. As Rob Joyce, former Chief Hacker of the NSA Tailored Access Operations (TAO) and new White House Cybersecurity Coordinator, said in a rare presentation last year, “Persistence and focus will get you in without a zero day; there are so many more vectors…such as stolen credentials…that are easier, less risky, more productive.”Innovative ApproachAfter years of working on endpoint technologies and deep in the trenches with customers, Glenn, Ben and Matt each independently saw that user security was underserved. Credentials are often the keys to the kingdom — the easiest vector for attackers. And abuse is hard to detect and remediate today — there are no good existing solutions. Obsidian has three core product theses in securing users: a modern machine learning approach, an architecture that fits today’s hybrid reality, and design for operational security efficiency. Ben moved his family from Chicago to join Glenn and Matt in Southern California, and Obsidian has set up offices in gorgeous Newport Beach. (Just check out Matt’s shorts and flip flops in the picture!) They have begun recruiting and product development, and are in conversations with prospective customer design partners. If you have interest in joining an early world-class product team looking to help solve an important area in enterprise security, please email apply@obsidiansecurity.com. We are thrilled to back the Obsidian team and look forward to helping them on their mission to provide user protection in a hybrid cloud world.Share9Never miss a story from Greylock Perspectives, when you sign up for Medium.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
