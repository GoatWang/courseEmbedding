This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Stanley C. Horton
Thank you, Molly, and good morning, everyone. I hope you've had a chance to review the earnings press release that we issued this morning. In addition to reporting earnings, we also announced a quarterly distribution of $0.5325 cents per unit or $2.13 annualized. Jamie will review the results of the quarter shortly.
In the second quarter, we continued to make progress on executing our growth strategy. On May 28, we announced that we had formalized our joint venture with Williams to continue the development of the Bluegrass Pipeline and related fractionation and storage assets, including a potential new LPG terminal.
As discussed in our last earnings call, the Bluegrass Pipeline is designed to transport Marcellus and Utica mixed NGL production to growing petrochemical markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The pipeline is proposed to be connected to a new NGL fractionation facility named the Moss Lake fractionation, which would be constructed at our Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles area, as well as a new NGL storage facilities.

We're also exploring development of a new LPG export terminal that would be named the Moss Lake LPG terminal. At this stage, together with Williams, we are meeting with customers about the project and anticipate an open season for the project later this year.
There are 3 segments of the proposed Bluegrass Pipeline: construction of the pipeline from the Marcellus Utica shale basins to an interconnection with Texas Gas at Hardinsburg, Kentucky; conversion of a portion of Texas Gas that represents approximately 600 miles of pipeline from Hardinsburg to Eunice, Louisiana; and construction of a pipeline from Eunice to our Sulphur Hub in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area.
On May 29, we filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for the abandonment authority to begin the conversion process of approximately 600 miles in natural gas pipeline to NGL service. The joint venture structure with Williams is anticipated to be 50-50. The agreement also contemplates different scenarios under which both Boardwalk and Williams may adjust their ownership positions in the project. These scenarios will be a evaluated as we proceed through the development of the project. If all conditions are met, the targeted in-service date is late 2015.
Now to our other projects. Our $300 million, 550 million cubic feet a day Southeast Market Expansion project is on schedule and currently in the environmental assessment process at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We expect construction to commence in the first half of 2014 within the expected in-service date of late 2014.
The Flag City gas processing plant commenced operations in the second quarter, and the construction was completed within budget. We have completed the leaching of the salt dome cavern expansion at Petal and will begin shortly injecting the base gas into the cavern, which has approximately 5 billion cubic feet of working gas capacity. The total working gas capacity at the Petal Gas Storage assets, including this expansion, is fully contracted.
We're also proceeding as planned with 2 pipeline projects that will support electric power generation loads on our system. Construction of the 125 million cubic feet project in North Texas is scheduled to begin this quarter with an anticipated in-service date in the first quarter of 2014. The 100 million cubic feet project in the Mississippi River Corridor in Louisiana is already under construction with a targeted in-service date in the fourth quarter of this year. These 2 projects have a combined cost of approximately $50 million.
Construction is nearly complete on the 50 million Choctaw Brine project, and we anticipate that this project will be placed in service in the third quarter. So it's been a busy quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making in executing our strategy to grow and diversify the company through new projects and by optimizing the use of existing assets.
That concludes my comments on this quarter, and I will turn the call now over to Jamie.
Jamie L. Buskill
Thank you, Stan, and good morning, everyone. Operating revenues for the second quarter were $289 million, which is $13 million or 5% higher than the comparable period in 2012. The increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues of $24 million from our acquisition of BLM, offset primarily by a reduction in our transportation revenues related to contract renewals and lower utilization driven by unfavorable market conditions and mild weather.
For the second quarter, we transported 567 TBtu of natural gas and 10 million barrels of liquids. Turning now to operating expenses. We reported operating expenses of $178 million for the quarter, an increase of $11 million or 6% from $167 million for the comparable period in 2012, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream and higher fuel costs. The higher fuel costs were offset by higher revenues from fuel, as both were driven by higher natural gas prices.

Excluding Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream, A&G and O&M expenses were favorable. During the quarter, we recorded a gain of approximately $17 million primarily related to the disposition of base gas. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $179 million, an increase of $10 million or 5% from $169 million for the comparable period in 2012. Net income for the quarter was $71 million, an increase of $6 million or 8% from $65 million for the comparable period last year. Both adjusted EBITDA and net income were impacted by the items previously discussed.
We generated $149 million of distributable cash for the quarter. This compares to $130 million generated in the second quarter of 2012, an increase of 15%. As of June 30, outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were $20 million, with an available borrowing capacity of $980 million. In May, we issued approximately 12.7 million units that provided net proceeds of approximately $377 million, which was used primarily to pay down our revolver. Debt-to-EBITDA for the 12 months ended June 30 was 4.4x compared with 5.0x for the 12 months ended June 30, 2012.
Regarding Bluegrass, we have entered into arrangements with a subsidiary of Loews Corporation to invest in the Bluegrass project, under which they will fund 90% of the preconstruction costs and we will fund the remaining 10%. We estimate that the preconstruction costs to be invested under this arrangement will be approximately $150 million, of which approximately $110 million is expected to be funded in 2013. So in 2013, we estimate that Boardwalk's capital expenditures for Bluegrass will total approximately $11 million.
We anticipate growth capital expenditures related to previously announced projects, including our portion of Bluegrass, will be approximately $270 million -- or I'm sorry, $260 million in 2013, of which $120 million has been invested through the second quarter. Maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be $100 million, of which $22 million has been invested through the second quarter.
That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Darren Horowitz, Raymond James.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
A couple of quick questions for you on Bluegrass. Has anything changed from a scale, scope or timing perspective? Do you guys still expect the abandonment process to take somewhere between 9 to 12 months? And how do you envision the timing around the antitrust clearance?
Stanley C. Horton
Let me talk first to the abandonment process. The schedule that we outlined previously is the one that we still feel that we can meet. Based upon the comments that we got with our customers, there is not a lot of intervention from our customers in it. So that timing is good. On the antitrust, we don't perceive any issues with the antitrust there. So the timing and the scope that we've laid out previously is pretty much unchanged.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then from a capital funding perspective, I appreciate the color on the 2013 commitment. Can you give us at least your early expectation of how the capital commitment could be throughout the course of 2014 and 2015?
Stanley C. Horton
No. We really can't at this point in time. We have not sat down with our general partner and talked about anything past 2013. A lot of decisions have to be made at the end of the year, and we'll do that in due time.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. So just to be clear, the $150 million that you will be funding, that represents your 10%, and the remaining 90%, obviously, would be Loews. And that, in aggregate, is 50% of the overall project cost, at least at this point, for full year 2013?

Jamie L. Buskill
That's correct. The total funding for our 50% will be $150 million, of which Loews will be funding 90% of and we'll be funding 10%. And of the $11 million we're anticipating that we will fund this year, $10 million of that has been funded through the end of the second quarter. So basically, we're done funding for the remainder of the year.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. But from a Bluegrass aggregate perspective, I guess total funding for the project itself should be about $300 million this year. Is that correct?
Jamie L. Buskill
That is correct.
Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then last question for me, Jamie. Just from a housekeeping perspective, obviously, maintenance CapEx has been tracking below what a lot of us have been modeling for the past couple of quarters. In terms of achieving that $100 million mark, is that going to be split evenly between the third and the fourth quarter? Or is it going to be a bit more lumpy?
Jamie L. Buskill
It's hard to say. At this point, I think that's a fair way of looking at it, is an even split for the third and fourth quarter.
Operator
Our next question is from Mark Reichman of Simmons.
Mark L. Reichman - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
It's several questions. First, the mention of the Moss Lake LPG terminal. Can you elaborate a little bit on the capacity and what particular products, and maybe the split between the products that will be exported?
Stanley C. Horton
The absolute size of the terminal has not been finalized. So I hesitate to put out a number there. So far, it's the products that we'd be looking at going through there: propanes, butanes, that -- those products.
Mark L. Reichman - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Okay. So -- and what would be the -- what would -- remind me on the timing.
Stanley C. Horton
The timing would be pretty much the same as the in-service date of the pipeline, the latter part of 2015.
Mark L. Reichman - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
2015, okay. And then also, wasn't there a mention -- it made mention of the potential for a fractionation plant? Are you able to speak to that in terms of the plans there?
Stanley C. Horton
Yes, I think I mentioned in my remarks that, basically, there's 3 projects that we're looking at, the Bluegrass Pipeline project: the Moss Lake fractionation and storage project and the possibility of the Moss Lake LPG terminal. So the frac and storage project -- the fractionator would be a 200,000-barrel-a-day fractionation facility, as currently contemplated.
Mark L. Reichman - Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Okay, great. And then lastly, on the transportation revenues this quarter that were impacted by the contract renewals and the lower utilization. Can you provide just a little more detail by system, relative to the prior year period, where you experienced the largest impacts?
Jamie L. Buskill
No. We're not going to get into breaking down by each pipeline. Because when we manage it, we really manage it at a Boardwalk level. And that's how we manage it internally. And if you look at the quarter, we were down about $10 million from contract renewals, which is in line with the expectations we laid out for the last 2 earnings calls, where we estimate we'll be down about $40 million this year from those renewals.
Operator
Our next question is from Stephen Maresca, Morgan Stanley.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
On the -- you mentioned, Stan, on the JV, 50-50. Can you describe some of these scenarios you talked about? The percents could change between you and Williams. Does one have the right to make that change? Or do both need to agree to change that percent?

Stanley C. Horton
Both parties have rights under the agreement. And -- excuse me, at this stage, we really don't want to go into the details of what those individual rights are of each company. But both companies do have rights with respect to ownership of the various projects as we go through.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. Is it -- is this something where, speaking for you and the company, you would want to own more of this if you could, or is there something you think you could do over time?
Stanley C. Horton
I hate to get into what-if scenarios. At the -- we're out trying to get market commitments right now. And these market commitments, hopefully, will support us moving forward with the project, moving forward with the timing at the beginning of next year. And both Williams and Boardwalk would be very satisfied with the market commitments that we got. And we move forward as we currently contemplate. So that's what both companies are hoping, and we'll go from there.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. And Jamie, you mentioned the subsidiary funding 90% of preconstruction costs, and you guys are doing the 10%. Going forward, is that something we should be thinking about in terms of how this will play out, where you guys will fund a smaller part initially, even as it starts to construct, and then [indiscernible] up in the air at that point?
Jamie L. Buskill
Well, I think it's premature to try to estimate what might happen beyond this preliminary construction phase. As Stan mentioned earlier, we'll provide additional color as the year develops and we get more definition to the project.
Stanley C. Horton
Let me make it clear, there's no agreement between Boardwalk and Loews having to do with funding of the project after December of next year. At the right time, we'll sit down and discuss that. But there is no agreement between us.
Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. And then my final question. Just as it relates to the distribution and thoughts about raising it at a few standard, Jamie. What would you like to see before you think about starting to raise it again? Is it completion of a project like this, or maybe just some thoughts around that?
Jamie L. Buskill
Well, again, we're not going to talk to the future as far as what may happen to our distribution. That's really up to our board, at the end of the day. But I think, just running the business and looking at the results, our strategy has been and continues to be, as Stan mentioned, to optimize our existing assets and to look at acquisitions that help us diversify and grow the company. And I think you've seen that over the last couple of years. We've still got quite a bit of work to do. Obviously, projects like the Bluegrass project could be a very good project to us. But I'm not going to sit here and try to project what impact that may or may not have on our distribution.
Stanley C. Horton
We've said a couple of times that there's a myriad of things that go into looking at recommending to our board about what the appropriate dividend is: how our base business is performing, the projects that we have on the drawing board, looking at coverage ratios, looking at debt-to-EBITDA ratios, looking at financing requirements that we have to do. I mean, there's a myriad of stuff that goes in it, and not just one project. And those are all the things that we look at when we give our recommendations to the board.
Operator
Our next question is from Christine Cho, Barclays.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Just some questions on your LPG terminal. I suspect that you and/or Williams already have existing water access. Have you added to this access in anticipation of Bluegrass, and is what you have enough? Or do you wait for results from the open season before going out and buying some?

Stanley C. Horton
Let me just say that the project is in the preliminary developmental stage, and all aspects of the project are being looked at and secured. And once we get the customer commitments, we will be in a position to move forward with the terminal, subject to both boards approving it. So all the things that need to be looked at during the developmental stage are being be looked at and -- to make sure that we've got everything that we need to proceed with the project to the extent that we get the right market commitments and the requisite board approvals.
Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division
Okay. And then I just have one kind of accounting question. The $17 million gain recognized on the sale of storage base gas, I've seen this pop up every so often. And I'm just curious if you could add some more color to it, just because from what I understand, you need the base gas to maintain the integrity of the system? But I think last year, it came up a number of times. So just kind of what is this exactly and how much more of this can you do?
Jamie L. Buskill
Well, if you look, as you said, through the years since we've been a public company, we've had this -- these gains quite often. And it's really a function of looking at our system, looking at the services we're provided. And that's not a constant. Those are constantly moving. And so we analyze our system. And when opportunities create themselves where we no longer need to own the base gas, it's beneficial for us to sell it. And it's beneficial in a couple ways: one, normally, this gas has a very low basis, so it frees up cash that can be invested into other parts of the business; and secondly, it creates capacity for other services. In this case, we sold 5 Bcf of gas, a base gas, which now creates opportunity for us to use that capacity for other storage or park and lend services. So we're constantly monitoring the system. It's hard to say if there'll be any future opportunities because systems are always changing. But that's something we're constantly analyzing.
Stanley C. Horton
Yes, let me add a little bit more color to that. You're correct in that there's a certain amount of gas that needs to be in the reservoir to maintain pressures. But it's not necessarily gas that we have to own. So to the extent that we can do a park and lend service that stretches across our winter season and that we've got the molecules in the storage facility, that works as well as gas that we own. Our storage facility doesn't recognize who owns the gas. So as long as we're maintaining the integrity of the storage facility and the integrity of meeting our perm [ph] loads, there are options that we've got on how we do that. And from time to time, as we look at it, there are opportunities for us to convert some of that into PAL service by selling some of the base gas, recognizing a gain and then also having the additional capacity to sell this pad. How much we have to do? We analyze that all the time. So that's what we are comfortable doing in this quarter. Not sure whether we'll do anymore at the end of the year. It just kind of all depends on a number of factors.
Operator
Our next question is from Sharon Lui, Wells Fargo.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
So I guess, going back in terms of the preconstruction funding by Loews. Is that for -- in exchange for, I guess, a percentage interest? Or is Boardwalk just obligated to reimburse for all the costs with interest at a certain point in time?
Jamie L. Buskill
It's for a percent. We are not obligated to reimburse for anything. It's -- in some ways, Loews has helped in the past on transactions and acquisitions. And you may recall, in those prior deals, there were no obligations to either drop down or to buyback or do anything like that. It's something that we analyze, and if it made sense to drop down assets, we did at that time. At this point, the 90%, that's their -- that's Loews ownership of our share of the joint venture with Williams, and we will own 10%. And how that progresses, we'll be able to discuss more to that as the project develops and time goes on.

Stanley C. Horton
We've always said one of the strengths of Boardwalk is the support we get from our GP. And this is just another example of the kind of support that we get from Loews from time to time on these projects.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And that would cover costs extending through the end of next year? Is that what you said before?
Stanley C. Horton
Yes.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And then, I guess, in terms of the LPG export facility. As contemplated, would you have the same amount of capacity as the pipe, meaning 200,000 barrels?
Stanley C. Horton
No, because not all of the product that moves through the pipe would be product that would be exported. As I said before, the size of the LPG export facility will be based upon the market commitments we get. But those will just be products like propanes and butanes. They wouldn't be the ethanes that would be exported.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Do you have a capacity in mind right now?
Stanley C. Horton
As I said, again, the facility can be sized based upon the commitments that we get from the customers. And once we get those commitments, then, we'll build it to size. So we don't have a number that we want to release right now.
Jamie L. Buskill
Yes, Sharon, one thing I do want to clarify is that the agreement with Loews, it's really not date-specific as it is dollar-specific. We -- that arrangement is for the preconstruction costs, which is estimated to be $150 million. Most of those costs will be incurred this year. We're anticipating $110 million of that $150 million will be through the end of this year. So it's not really date-specific as it is dollar-specific.
Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay, that's helpful. And my last question is just in terms of an update on what you're seeing for processing volumes and commitments for the Flag City facility?
Stanley C. Horton
Yes, I'll talk to that. As you're aware, 50% of the capacity of the plant is sold out under long-term contracts to Talisman and Statoil. Right now, today, we are moving and have moved since the plant went in service some interruptible volumes through the plant. We contemplate that we would continue to do that from time to time. And we have some negotiations going on for a longer-term firm contract that, hopefully, will come to fruition soon. So that's kind of where we are on the plant.
Operator
Our next question is from Matt Niblack, HITE.
Matt Niblack
Just a clarification question on the Bluegrass terms with your parent. So you said that they will have 90% ownership of the product -- of the project commensurate with their investment in the preconstruction costs. Just wanted to understand, was that the entire project or was that just the general statement that the -- their ownership will be proportional to their investment? And then how does the existing pipeline asset that's being modified, that sits at Boardwalk, figure into that division of interest?
Jamie L. Buskill
Yes. First of all, the only thing we're talking about in these cost estimates and the sharing of that funding with Loews is these preliminary construction costs, which is $150 million. Now if you look through the second quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we have already funded $10 million or, basically, our 10%. So when you look at the end of the quarter, Boardwalk actually owns roughly 60% of the investment and Loews will own 40%. Since Loews will be funding the remainder of the investment -- of that preliminary cost investment, their ownership will grow to 90%. Again, once we get more clarity on this project and we can talk to that, then we can provide additional color of what may happen after the preliminary costs. So everything is really just getting us up to the construction phase.

Matt Niblack
Okay. But then what value is being assigned to the existing asset that's being worked on? Is that -- as it pertains to dividing up this interest? It sounds like the value is 0, based on what you just said.
Jamie L. Buskill
I'm not sure I understand the question. There's -- at this point, it's preliminary construction costs. So there's been no assets moved. It's really just engineering work and survey work and the things you typically do in a construction-type project. So there's really -- there's not any physical assets in these numbers to speak of. It's, again, preliminary type construction work.
Stanley C. Horton
The Texas Gas facilities that are to be abandoned cannot be contributed to the partnership until an abandonment application is received from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. So there has been no transfer of the Texas Gas assets over to this project yet.
Matt Niblack
Okay, that's helpful. And then are you comfortable with the current sort of close to 4.5 debt-to-EBITDA level? Or is that something that you'll be looking to more proactively bring down over the coming months?
Jamie L. Buskill
We're pleased with the progress we've made. Actually, if you looked at 4.4, it's a little lower than that because you only have 3 quarters of Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream in your numbers at this point. But our target has been all along, is we'd like to be in the low 4s. So we're happy where we're seeing things. And we hope to continue to make progress there.
Operator
Our next question is from Yves Siegel, Neuberger Berman.
Yves C. Siegel - Neuberger Berman Management LLC
So just to be clear, before the open season or -- and before you actually get the results of the open season, it sounds like Williams and Boardwalk will be spending $300 million. Is that the right way to think about that? I mean...
Jamie L. Buskill
We are -- well, we're incurring costs today. We've yet to have the open season. As Stan mentioned, we -- the open season, we hope to have that kicked off in the second half of the year. And so yes, most of these costs are going to be incurred before you close that open season, but it may not be all.
Yves C. Siegel - Neuberger Berman Management LLC
Okay. And so sort of a back way for me to say that you folks might -- must have a high degree of confidence, to be committing as much capital as you are, that there'll be a positive outcome. I'm not sure if that was a question or just waiting for you to see if you had any comment on that.
Stanley C. Horton
I wasn't sure whether it was a question or not. We've said this before. We've been pleased with the reaction that we have gotten from customers that we've gone out and talked to. We've been pleased with the reception that we've gotten in the marketplace. But the proof is in the pudding when you can go sign contracts. So hopefully, by the end of the year, we'll have those and we can announce that we're moving forward. So in the meantime, there are a lot of development costs that need to be spent to make sure that we can hit that projected in-service date.
Yves C. Siegel - Neuberger Berman Management LLC
Okay. And not to belabor the point, but the second question is, you have plenty of capacity under your revolver at the end of the second quarter. Why did you need Loews to come in at this juncture?
Jamie L. Buskill
Well, I think, at this point, you really have the negative carry aspects of the preliminary costs. And it is quite a bit of money, as you pointed out. And we just thought that was a good arrangement for Boardwalk. And now I might add, on the revolver, subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have paid that $20 million off. So as we stand today, that -- we basically have the full revolver available to us. Plus, we'll do another project to use. If you look at our capital spend, we're going to spend $260 million this year on expansion projects. Only $10 million of that is Bluegrass-related. So we have quite a bit of other projects we're working on, and we continue to explore other opportunities outside of Bluegrass.

Stanley C. Horton
I guess, the way that I would put it here, Loews has offered to fund 90% of the development costs. If, for some reason, the project did not go, Loews loses most of the money, not Boardwalk. So we're somewhat insulated from that. They're taking the development risk on the project. And as the CEO of Boardwalk, I think that is a great deal for Boardwalk and my unitholders. So when that deal was offered to me, I'll take that deal any time.
Yves C. Siegel - Neuberger Berman Management LLC
Well done, Stan. And then the last question I have is -- well, 2 questions. One is, what's the acquisition landscape look like from your perspective?
Stanley C. Horton
I would say that based upon everything that we see out there right now, it's a fairly robust market. There seem to be quite a few assets for sale right now. So it's a pretty robust market. Then I'm just talking on kind of the macro level, not Boardwalk. There seem to be a lot out there for sale.
Yves C. Siegel - Neuberger Berman Management LLC
Okay. And then the last question. How would you characterize the recontracting? As we move into 2014, from a perspective, is the worst behind us in terms of the duration and revenues from the recontracting?
Stanley C. Horton
I don't want to say the worst is behind us. But on the recontracting, as Jamie had said before, the average length of our contract has been about 5 years. Of course, as you move through and recontract something, hopefully, when that renewal comes up, there'll be no further deterioration. So every year, we seem to work out a little bit more of the problem. But we have a few years to go on recontracts, that our ad rates today that are higher than the current basis. Now that being said, we are very hopeful that as demand continues to increase, that some of these basis differentials will continue to get better. So we'll just have to see what the market gives us. But when you start looking at the LPG terminals that are going to be coming on, we start looking at the growth in the electric generation market that's coming on, that's a whole lot of market demand and a whole lot more volumes that are going to be moving across these interstate systems. And it is our hope and our belief that, that's going to help basis differentials improve from the levels that they are today. So I'm hopeful that the worst is behind us. But you can't guarantee what the market's going to do.
Operator
Our next question is from John Edwards, Crédit Suisse.
John Edwards - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Just real quick, following up Yves' question, what -- in your recontracting, about what kind of deterioration are you seeing right now?
Stanley C. Horton
I think we gave the guidance on 2013 that it looked like, from a base of about $125 million, that we expected to see about a $40 million deterioration in revenues from the recontracting of that. As we move through 2013, that seems to be pretty much on target. We have not turned our attention yet totally to 2014. As we're finishing up 2013, we don't have the level of contract renewals that we have in 2014. We're not kind of ready to give any guidance on 2014. Hopefully, we can talk about that next quarter. But for '13, our expectations have seemed to be pretty much in line with the results that we're seeing.
John Edwards - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Yes. I guess I didn't ask the question the right way. I was thinking in terms of the go-forward sort of percentages you're seeing. I mean, is it maybe 5% lower, 10% lower, that...
Jamie L. Buskill
Yes. John, it's too early -- as Stan said, it's too early to talk about '14 and '15, as we would really just get into renegotiating those here in the second half of the year. So we'll provide more color on that. But as Stan mentioned, right now, it's shaping up to be a more typical size year as far as amount of renewals we deal with. Although, even that, it's a little premature to provide a number. Because as you deal with the contracts this year, some of them may only roll a year. And they do, that's added to your '14 numbers. So that's why we're hesitant to give any guidance as to the number until we get toward the end of the year.

John Edwards - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, fair enough. And then not to belabor the Loews arrangement, but just -- I just want to clarify. So the way it works right now, you're doing 90-10 on the preliminary costs. And then beyond that, it's -- the costs will fall back to Boardwalk more or less...
Jamie L. Buskill
We didn't say how they would work beyond that. All we're talking to today are the preliminary construction costs, and that's all we can talk to at this point. And it will get to 90-10 once all the costs are incurred. As I mentioned earlier, we have already funded $10 million. So today, we own about 60% of that investment. Loews will be making the remaining investments this year until it gets to a 90% ownership. And then once it's at 90%, we'll maintain that 90-10 relationship until the $150 million is spent. After that, we'll provide additional guidance as we get additional information and work through this project and have more definition to it.
John Edwards - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
So I guess what I'm getting at, so it's possible that a portion of the project could end up at Loews, not -- instead of Boardwalk. Is that correct? I mean, beyond this preliminary.
Stanley C. Horton
I don't want to speculate on what might happen. I think that we've got to be very careful here to specify that there is no agreement between Boardwalk and Loews relating to the funding of the project past the developmental stage. I mean, there just is not. So to speculate whether there is or would not, I just can't do that right now.
John Edwards - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay, fair enough. And then just -- this is kind of a follow-up to Steve's question on the -- I don't know if you can speak to this, but on the -- at the Williams Boardwalk level, you're indicating there are some options to increase or decrease. And I wonder if you could speak to, is there a maximum or minimum ownership you can speak to by the parties?
Stanley C. Horton
I really can't speak to that right now. We've kind of -- I have an agreement with Williams that these are internal documents right now. And all of the various scenarios, they don't really mean anything until each party sits down and makes its selections. And at that point in time, we can give some guidance to the marketplace. But I don't want to speculate what each party may do or what each party's rights may be.
Operator
Our next question is from Elvira Scotto, RBC Capital Markets.
Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I just had a question on -- a follow-up question. Is there any other hurdle to get through before you can move to open season, binding open season? Or is it just hammering out the details of the projects?
Stanley C. Horton
It's a number of things. Number one, doing the details of the project, coming up with the absolute best estimate of project scope that we can, capital costs that we can. Finalizing the tariff for the NGL line because it's a regulated pipeline. The tariff has got to be in conformance with FERC regulations. Finishing the various pro forma agreements that we have on the frac and storage and on the LPG terminal. And then going out and talking with our customers about those rates and charges, and some negotiation. That's the process that we're in right now, the typical development process of scope, timing and pro forma contracts with customers.
Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay. But there's no regulatory-like hurdle, like the FTC issue or...
Stanley C. Horton
No, ma'am. No ma'am. There's not. Not at this point.
Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Okay, great. And then my other question. Are you actively -- do you think there's any potential to repurpose any of your other assets?

Stanley C. Horton
Well, I mean, quite frankly, we have -- with this project, we will have now, in the 2 years since I've been here, repurposed of about 1,000 miles of our interstate pipeline. We did almost 400 miles of the Gulf South Pipeline, when we repurposed that from a dry gas line to a liquids gas line that formed the basis of the gathering facilities for our Flag City project. And we do have an abandonment application on file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where about 25% of the pipe of Gulf South would be abandoned from interstate service to intrastate service. This is small-diameter low-pressure pipeline that is really not pipeline that most people think of as intrastate pipelines. So if we're successful in that, we would be moving a lot of those pipeline facilities into 3 intrastate pipelines. So we continue to look for ways to operate our systems differently, repurpose our pipelines. And undoubtedly, we will find more ways to do that.
Operator
Our next question is from Ross Payne, Wells Fargo.
Stanley Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
On the $150 million in preliminary cost estimates, is Williams varying any of the preliminary costs? Or is that largely the [indiscernible].
Jamie L. Buskill
That $150 million is just our share of the Bluegrass, Moss Lake. The total investment of that is going to be roughly $300 million. Williams will share in 50% and we'll share in 50%. So everything we've talked to is just our share of that investment as a 50% owner.
Stanley Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And can you guys give us some rough range, although it could be a large range, of what the ultimate costs of this project are going to look like?
Stanley C. Horton
No, we really can't. Once we have finished the design of the project and gotten the customer commitments and know exactly what the size is and whether all the pieces are going to happen, then we can do that. But to do it before then is -- serves really no purpose. So...
Stanley Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And can you -- I mean, that $300 million is a pretty large number for repurposing pipes. So can you give us an idea of what a lot of those costs are going to be? Are there any kind of rights-of-way issues that are...
Stanley C. Horton
No. The $300 million is not to repurpose the pipes. The $300 million is to do all of the predevelopment work that needs to be done on the project. That includes the new build sections of segment 1 and segment 3 that I talked to you about and some of the work on the Texas Gas system on converting the gas line to a liquids line. But it really has nothing to do with repurposing of the TGT system.
Stanley Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And does that include getting rights-of-way in that number or not?
Stanley C. Horton
It includes rights-of-way. It includes permits. It includes all the preliminary stuff that you have to do for -- to be ready to proceed with construction once we get the market commitments.
Operator
Our next question is from Matt Niblack, HITE.
Matt Niblack
Yes. At the sale of the base gas, I see that you are including that in unadjusted EBITDA and DCF. Is that correct?
Jamie L. Buskill
That is correct. If you look, as we've mentioned earlier, this is something that we have quite often. If you look at -- go back since its being public, most years, we have some type of gas sales that we have a gain on. And so it's recurring enough that we do include it in our EBITDA and distributable cash numbers.
Matt Niblack
This is one of the larger ones, though, is it not?
Jamie L. Buskill
I'd have to go back in and look. From a cash standpoint, probably not. From a gains standpoint, probably it's fairly large just because the basis on that was so low.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call over to Molly Whitaker for closing remarks.
Molly Ladd Whitaker
