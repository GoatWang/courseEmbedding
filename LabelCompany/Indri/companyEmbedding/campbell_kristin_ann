What is a State Prison?State prisons are long-term facilities typically used to house offenders sentenced for more than one year. These facilities operate under the legal authority of the state, and can be both publicly and privately run. Like federal prisons, state prisons are authorized to both incarcerate and execute prisoners where the state has the death penalty. The majority of inmates in state prisons have been convicted of violent and drug offenses. An inmate's average sentence length in a state prison is between 5 to 10 years.
Michigan County Jail Inmate Search

County Jails also supervise community-sentenced offenders under electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, and work programs. An inmate's average sentence length in a local jail is between 20 and 30 days.
