These days, that’s still the case. I get to work with inspired people who have a commitment to making great things happen in the world. 
What you won't learn from my bio:  I was the bass player for a band called the Sabers in Barberton, Ohio.@kelleybrosView Full BioFull BioDavid Kelley is the founder and chairman of the global design and innovation company IDEO. Kelley also founded Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, known as the d.school. As Stanford’s Donald W. Whittier Professor in Mechanical Engineering, Kelley is the Academic Director of both of the degree-granting undergraduate and graduate programs in Design within the School of Engineering, and has taught classes in the program for more than 35 years.
Kelley’s most enduring contributions are in human-centered design methodology and design thinking. He is most passionate about using design to help unlock creative confidence in everyone from students to business executives. A frequent speaker on these topics, Kelley and his brother co-authored the New York Times best-selling book Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, Kelley worked as an engineer at both Boeing and NCR. Drawn to design, he entered Stanford University in 1975, where he earned his master’s degree in Engineering/Product Design. In 1978, he founded the design firm that would become IDEO and, in that same year, began his teaching career at Stanford, receiving tenure in 1990. He also founded an early-stage venture-capital firm in 1984 called Onset, and was instrumental in starting a special effects firm called Edge Innovations, which creates unique Animatronics for the film industry.
Kelley was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2000. He holds honorary PhD's from both the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth and Art Center College in Pasadena. He has been recognized with numerous honors, including the Chrysler Design Award and the National Design Award in Product Design from the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth, and the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation.

Work in industry[edit]
Kelley began work as an engineer, first at Boeing and later at NCR.[2] At Boeing, he was responsible for the design of the Lavatory Occupied sign for the 747 airplane.[4] This experience led him to return to school. In 1977, he earned his master's degree from the Joint Program in Design at Stanford University, popularly called the Product Design program.[5] In 1978, he partnered with another Stanford Product Design graduate, Dean Hovey, to form Hovey-Kelley Design. Hovey left to pursue other interests and the firm was renamed "David Kelley Design" (DKD).[6]
In 1984, he co-founded Onset Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. He also co-founded Edge Innovations, the special-effects company responsible for the whales in the Free Willy movies, among many other film credits.[7] In 1991, Kelley merged DKD with three other design firms (Mike Nuttall's Matrix Product Design in Palo Alto, ID TWO in San Francisco, and Moggridge Associates in London, the latter two founded by Bill Moggridge) to create IDEO, which he ran as CEO until 2000. As chairman and managing partner, Kelley continues to play an active role at IDEO.
Work in education[edit]
Kelley began teaching in the Stanford Product Design program in 1978, after earning his master's. He was briefly a PhD student.[8] In 1990, he became a tenured professor, and was named the Donald W.

Work in industry[edit]
Kelley began work as an engineer, first at Boeing and later at NCR.[2] At Boeing, he was responsible for the design of the Lavatory Occupied sign for the 747 airplane.[4] This experience led him to return to school. In 1977, he earned his master's degree from the Joint Program in Design at Stanford University, popularly called the Product Design program.[5] In 1978, he partnered with another Stanford Product Design graduate, Dean Hovey, to form Hovey-Kelley Design. Hovey left to pursue other interests and the firm was renamed "David Kelley Design" (DKD).[6]
In 1984, he co-founded Onset Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. He also co-founded Edge Innovations, the special-effects company responsible for the whales in the Free Willy movies, among many other film credits.[7] In 1991, Kelley merged DKD with three other design firms (Mike Nuttall's Matrix Product Design in Palo Alto, ID TWO in San Francisco, and Moggridge Associates in London, the latter two founded by Bill Moggridge) to create IDEO, which he ran as CEO until 2000. As chairman and managing partner, Kelley continues to play an active role at IDEO.
Work in education[edit]
Kelley began teaching in the Stanford Product Design program in 1978, after earning his master's. He was briefly a PhD student.[8] In 1990, he became a tenured professor, and was named the Donald W.

DavidKelly


PartnerDavid Kelly has represented clients in trademark, copyright, and unfair competition issues for more than 30 years, with a focus on litigation, disputes, and strategic counseling. Dave is consistently recognized as one of the country’s top trademark lawyers. In 2016, The Legal 500 U.S. named Dave as a Leading Lawyer, Legal 500's top category, in both trademark litigation and non-contentious trademark matters for the ninth consecutive year. This highest honor was bestowed upon only 9 lawyers across the country in each category. From 2009-2013, Dave was the only U.S. trademark lawyer to be named a Leading Lawyer in both categories, and for 2014-2016 Dave is just one of two Leading Lawyers in both categories. Most recently, in March 2017, Dave was named to the inaugural Legal 500 Hall of Fame, a recognition reserved for lawyers recognized by The Legal 500 as one of the elite leading lawyers in a practice area for six consecutive years. Only 11 trademark lawyers in the US were recognized in the categories of either trademark litigation or trademark non-contentious, and Dave was the only lawyer named to the Legal 500 Hall of Fame in both trademark categories. According to The Legal 500, clients describe Dave as “an outstanding trademark litigator” and “an exceptionally bright and thoughtful advocate.” Clients also look to Dave for strategic advice based on his reputation for being “full of business savvy” and “a source of much practical advice…that understands our business in a way that most lawyers don’t.” In 2017, World Trademark Review 1000 named Dave one of the top 11 lawyers nationwide for trademark enforcement and litigation, the fourth year in a row Dave was named in this top national band, and one of 6 "Gold" status lawyers for enforcement and litigation and one of 9 "Gold" status lawyers for prosecution and strategy in the Washington, DC area, the third year in a row Dave was awarded Gold status in both categories. According to World Trademark Review 1000, clients describe Dave as "fantastic and practical"; a "superb lawyer" with a "transnational reputation" who "is massively experienced, has a fantastically clear grasp of things and is an eminently practical and skilled negotiator"; Dave "has always been excellent...and there was no doubt that we would follow him" when he co-founded Kelly IP; and clients rely on Dave because his "substantial proficiency and estimable business acumen single him out in the field” and "his real-world advice doesn't elevate law above business." Dave has been similarly recognized by Managing Intellectual Property, IP Stars, Legal Media Group, WIPR, Super Lawyers, and others.Before joining Kelly IP, Dave practiced trademark and copyright law for 26 years at Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, L.L.P in Washington, D.C. He served as chair of Finnegan’s Trademark and Copyright Practice Group for most of his 20-plus years as a partner.david.kelly@kelly-ip.com(202) 808-3571

David Kelley’s company IDEO helped create many icons of the digital generation — but what matters even more to him is unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations to innovate routinely.

Why you should listen
As founder of legendary design firm IDEO, David Kelley built the  company that created many icons of the digital generation -- the first  mouse, the first Treo, the thumbs up/thumbs down button on your Tivo's  remote control, to name a few. But what matters even more to him is  unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations so they can  innovate routinely.David Kelley's most enduring contributions to  the field of design are a methodology and culture of innovation. More  recently, he led the creation of the groundbreaking d.school at  Stanford, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where students from  the business, engineering, medicine, law, and other diverse disciplines  develop the capacity to solve complex problems collaboratively and  creatively.Kelley was working (unhappily) as an electrical  engineer when he heard about Stanford's cross-disciplinary Joint Program  in Design, which merged engineering and art. What he learned there -- a  human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems through  design -- propelled his professional life as a "design thinker."In  1978, he co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO, now  emulated worldwide for its innovative, user-centered approach to design.  IDEO works with a range of clients -- from food and beverage  conglomerates to high tech startups, hospitals to universities, and  today even governments -- conceiving breakthrough innovations ranging  from a life-saving portable defibrillator to a new kind of residence for  wounded warriors, and helping organizations build their own innovation  culture.Today, David serves as chair of IDEO and is the Donald  W. Whittier Professor at Stanford, where he has taught for more than 25  years. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned David the Sir  Misha Black Medal for his “distinguished contribution to design  education.” He has also won the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation,  as well as the Chrysler Design Award and National Design Award in  Product Design from the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design  Museum, and he is a member of the National Academy of Engineers.
What others say

“We're focused more and more on human-centered design; that involves designing behaviors and personality into products.” — David Kelley

Bio

David Kelley's work is dedicated to helping people gain confidence in their creative abilities.  He employs a project based methodology called Design Thinking within both the Product Design Program and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design.  Design Thinking is based on building empathy for user needs, developing solutions with iterative prototyping, and inspiring ideas for the future through storytelling.  The Product Design program emphasizes the blending of engineering innovation, human values, and manufacturing concerns into a single curriculum. Kelley teaches engineering design methodology, the techniques of quick prototyping to prove feasibility, and design through understanding of user needs.

Reclaim Your Creative Confidence
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

Kelley, T., Kelley, D.

2012; 90 (12): 115-?


Abstract
Most people are born creative. But over time, a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses. We become warier of judgment, more cautious more analytical. The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of IDEO, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another. Creativity is something you practice, say the authors, not just a talent you are born with.
