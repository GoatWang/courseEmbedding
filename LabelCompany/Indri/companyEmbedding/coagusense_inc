Coag-Sense | Greater INR Control Is At Hand | PT/INR Monitoring System

Coagusense






Introducing the Coag-Sense™ PT/INR Monitoring System. The first PT/INR 
            system to directly detect clot formation representing a breakthrough in PT/INR testing 
            design simplicity!
Two million new people start taking the oral anticoagulant drug Coumadin® (warfarin) 
            every year to prevent blood clots, heart attacks and stroke. Correct dosing of Coumadin is determined for each patient by periodically measuring blood clotting time using the prothrombin time (PT) test. The simplicity of the new Coag-Sense system offers clinicians not only the performance they require but also the reliability they demand.  With the recent expansion in Medicare coverage, most patients on warfarin can now easily test their PT/INR with confidence in their own home.
The Coag-Sense System is available exclusively through a network of qualified distributors. Call 1-866-903-0890 for ordering information.



Intended Use- The Coag-Sense Self-Test PT Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic device that provides quantitative prothrombin time (PT) results, expressed in seconds and international normalized ratio (INR) units. It uses fresh capillary whole blood. It is intended for use by properly selected and suitably trained patients or their caregivers on the order of the treating doctor. Patients should be stabilized on warfarin-type (coumarin) anticoagulation therapy prior to self-testing with the Coag-Sense Self-Test PT Monitoring System. It is not intended to be used for screening purposes.

Coag-Sense






 Accurate results in less than a minute
The Coag-Sense meter directly measures the prothrombin time, so the time required to perform a test is the actual prothrombin time in seconds. 
By not using look-up tables or curve fitting algorithms, the Coag-Sense meter offers both speed and accuracy. 
Superb Precision
Coag-Sense's patented micro mechanical detection system delivers superb precision and reliability. Professionals testing with the Coag-Sense system 
have demonstrated %CV's of 2.5%. Unlike electrochemical detection based devices, the Coag-Sense system does not rely on the concentration of blood 
constituents not involved in clot formation to produce results. This improves precision and reduces variability in readings often seen in other 
systems.
Red Blood Cells Not Required
Because the Coag-Sense system uses a micro mechanical means of clot detection instead of electrochemical, re-calcified plasma control strips can be run as easily as whole blood. This also means that the Coag-Sense system is not affected by low hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, a common source of inaccurate results in systems using current to detect clot formation.
Small sample size (10 µl minimum) for easy dosing
Only 10µl of fingerstick sample is required to run the Coag-Sense system. To reduce strip waste caused by unsteady hands, sample is easily transferred from the patient's finger to the test strip using the minipipette or sample transfer tubes provided.
Offers true controls using the actual thromboplastin and plasma
The purpose of quality control testing for a prothrombin time test system is to verify the integrity of both device and reagent performance. Coag-Sense is the first system to offer true high and low control strips which contain the same thromboplastin used in the patient test strip along with plasma of known INR. There is no substitute for confirming performance of the actual thromboplastin used in the patient test strips.

Other Benefits of the Coag-Sense System Include: 

Portable, yet stable design
Barcoding on each test strip – no calibration code input or chip required
No test strip refrigeration required
No electrodes to clean or worry about 
Enclosed detection wheel in each strip eliminates cross contamination risk
AC powered or battery powered for convenience
Testing, treatment and potential revenue capture in one appointment

"We took our Coag-Sense system on a cruise through the South Pacific where it would have been nearly impossible to get tested. We love that machine! �L. Jensen, Bend OR

If If you are taking oral anticoagulants such as Coumadin® (warfarin), PT/INR Self-Testing represents a truly convenient testing option. Testing can easily be performed once a week in the comfort of your own home. In addition to the convenience, studies have shown that patients performing home PT/INR testing spend more time in therapeutic range because they are able to monitor their trends.¹ After each test, patients notify their physician of the results and the physician will determine if any treatment adjustments are required. The goal of self-monitoring PT/INR levels is to improve control and reduce the potential for adverse events.
You can learn more about testing your PT/INR at home by contacting Coag-Sense Customer Service at 1-866-903-0890 or email us at info@coagusense.com

Coag-Sense






When clinicians and researchers want the most accurate means of determining prothrombin time, they turn to either the World Health Organization (WHO) mechanical tilt-tube technique or the Fibrometer. Both these methods use a mechanical approach to directly detect clot formation, but they are cumbersome to perform. The new Coag-Sense PT/INR Monitoring System represents a breakthrough in point-of-care prothrombin time monitoring technology by miniaturizing and simplifying a direct mechanical means of detecting clot formation.
By directly detecting the clot, the Coag-Sense system avoids the challenges that plague other systems that use secondary means of clot detection like monitoring changes in impedance or pressure. For example, the concentration of red blood cells or other substances in blood sample can affect results in the measurement process of those products. The Coag-Sense system simply lifts the fibrin clot from the reaction well which interrupts a light beam. The PT time is the actual time from when the blood sample is applied to when the clot is formed. This produces results similar to the gold standard WHO tilt-tube methods as can be seen in the comparison graph below



The new Coag-Sense system offers healthcare professionals an easy and efficient way to obtain accurate and reliable PT/INR results at the point of care. Now you can make immediate therapy adjustments and improve patient satisfaction. To learn more, please contact Customer Service at 866-903-0890.

COMPANY DESCRIPTION: 




		CoagUSense, Inc. develops, manufactures and markets a PT/INR system that 
		directly detects clot formation.








PRODUCT 
		INFORMATION:






		The 
		Coag-Sense� which represents a breakthrough in PT/INR testing design 
		simplicity! Two million new people start taking the oral anticoagulant 
		drug Coumadin� (warfarin) every year to prevent blood clots, heart 
		attacks and stroke. Correct dosing of Coumadin is determined for each 
		patient by periodically measuring blood clotting time using the 
		prothrombin time (PT) test. 
 


		The simplicity of the Coag-Sense� PT/INR Monitoring System offers 
		clinicians not only the performance they require but also the 
		reliability they demand. With the recent expansion in Medicare coverage, 
		most patients on warfarin can now easily test their PT/INR with 
		confidence in their own home.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Coag-Sense






When clinicians and researchers want the most accurate means of determining prothrombin time, they turn to either the World Health Organization (WHO) mechanical tilt-tube technique or the Fibrometer. Both these methods use a mechanical approach to directly detect clot formation, but they are cumbersome to perform. The new Coag-Sense PT/INR Monitoring System represents a breakthrough in point-of-care prothrombin time monitoring technology by miniaturizing and simplifying a direct mechanical means of detecting clot formation.
By directly detecting the clot, the Coag-Sense system avoids the challenges that plague other systems that use secondary means of clot detection like monitoring changes in impedance or pressure. For example, the concentration of red blood cells or other substances in blood sample can affect results in the measurement process of those products. The Coag-Sense system simply lifts the fibrin clot from the reaction well which interrupts a light beam. The PT time is the actual time from when the blood sample is applied to when the clot is formed. This produces results similar to the gold standard WHO tilt-tube methods as can be seen in the comparison graph below



The new Coag-Sense system offers healthcare professionals an easy and efficient way to obtain accurate and reliable PT/INR results at the point of care. Now you can make immediate therapy adjustments and improve patient satisfaction. To learn more, please contact Customer Service at 866-903-0890.

Coag-Sense | Greater INR Control Is At Hand | PT/INR Monitoring System

Coagusense






Introducing the Coag-Sense™ PT/INR Monitoring System. The first PT/INR 
            system to directly detect clot formation representing a breakthrough in PT/INR testing 
            design simplicity!
Two million new people start taking the oral anticoagulant drug Coumadin® (warfarin) 
            every year to prevent blood clots, heart attacks and stroke. Correct dosing of Coumadin is determined for each patient by periodically measuring blood clotting time using the prothrombin time (PT) test. The simplicity of the new Coag-Sense system offers clinicians not only the performance they require but also the reliability they demand.  With the recent expansion in Medicare coverage, most patients on warfarin can now easily test their PT/INR with confidence in their own home.
The Coag-Sense System is available exclusively through a network of qualified distributors. Call 1-866-903-0890 for ordering information.



Intended Use- The Coag-Sense Self-Test PT Monitoring System is an in vitro diagnostic device that provides quantitative prothrombin time (PT) results, expressed in seconds and international normalized ratio (INR) units. It uses fresh capillary whole blood. It is intended for use by properly selected and suitably trained patients or their caregivers on the order of the treating doctor. Patients should be stabilized on warfarin-type (coumarin) anticoagulation therapy prior to self-testing with the Coag-Sense Self-Test PT Monitoring System. It is not intended to be used for screening purposes.
