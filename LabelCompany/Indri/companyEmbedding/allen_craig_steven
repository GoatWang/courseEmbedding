	January 11, 1983 - May 2, 2014 Our hearts were broken Friday May 2, 2014 when we learned that Craig had passed away from injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. He was a wonderful father, son, brother, uncle, nephew, cousin and friend. He will be sorely missed by all of us who were lucky enough to know him during his short life. Craig was born on January 11, 1983 in Bountiful to Steve and Claudia Allen. He graduated from Viewmont High School in 2001. He also attended Weber State University. At age 19 he was called to serve a mission in Seoul, Korea. He married Alyssa Van Wagoner (Rivers) in March of 2003. They were later divorced. Craig was a loving father to Ben (age 10) and Luke (age 6). They were the loves of his life and he spent every minute he could with them. He loved his grandparents and had a special relationship with them. He was so full of life, extremely entertaining, funny and charismatic. He loved his brothers and sister and they in return loved his fun loving personality and antics. When Craig was around he had everyone laughing and enjoying themselves. Through all of his ups and downs those closest to him knew of his big and caring heart. He loved the outdoors, animals, BBQs and fun times with friends and family. He also enjoyed building and carpentry and working with his Dad. Craig was preceded in death by grandparents Jack and Connie Bangerter and grandfather Reese K. Allen. Survived by his children Benjamin Craig Allen, Lukas Jack Allen, his parents Steve and Claudia Allen, sister Diana Allen Andrew, brothers Thomas James Allen and Clark David Allen. Also survived by his grandmother Janice E. Allen and many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews. We love you Craig more than you can even imagine. Your fun-loving, outgoing personality will be forever missed. Friends and family can visit Thursday, May 8 at Russon Brothers Mortuary, 295 North Main Street, Bountiful, from 6 to 8 pm. Services will be held Friday, May 9 at the Bountiful 34th Ward Chapel, 540 N. 1200 East. Visit with family from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. and the funeral starting at 11 a.m. Interment will be at the Bountiful City Cemetery, 2224 South 200 West following the funeral services.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1999 edition. Language: English. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. 562 pages.

Item Description: Materials Research Society. Hardback. Book Condition: new. BRAND NEW, Oxide Semiconductors and Thin Films, Andre Schleife, Martin Allen, Craig B. Arnold, Steven Durbin, Nini Pryds, Symposium Z, 'Oxide Semiconductors', and Symposium F, 'Oxide Thin Films for Renewable Energy Applications', were held November 25-30 at the 2012 MRS Fall Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts. Oxide materials are attracting considerable attention both as semiconductors for a wide range of potential device applications but also in energy research spanning from photo- and electro-catalysis, to electrolytes and electrodes used in batteries or fuel cells. This symposium proceedings volume collects recent reports from the meeting aimed at providing a fundamental understanding of bulk oxide materials as well as thin films and nano-structures. The topics covered in this volume are quite broad and include such areas as growth and doping, defects and characterisation, and device applications.  Bookseller Inventory # B9781605114712
