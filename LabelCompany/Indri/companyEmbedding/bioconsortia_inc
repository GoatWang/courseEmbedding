Increasing crop yields by enriching the microbiome








Improving plant traits with teams of microbes








Directed selection for the discovery of beneficial microbial consortia













BioConsortia is developing highly effective microbial consortia for increasing agricultural yields.
We have developed a revolutionary Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process, which uses directed selection to discover beneficial teams of microbes. This novel, patented model works by controlling the seed genetics and the environment while changing the microbial community in order to shift trait performance in the crop toward improved targeted phenotypes.

						What are microbial consortia?					 


Microbial consortia are elements of diverse communities of bacteria and fungi found naturally throughout the biosphere. Microbes naturally colonize plants, providing beneficial, harmful, or neutral interactions. We identify the best Microbial teams that influence the phenotype of the plant. Our process is a powerful alternative to stacking or mixing individually identified microbes, resulting in products with higher efficacy, pre-selected for their ability to colonize a plant together.

						Revolutionary R&D Platform					 


BioConsortia has developed a proprietary and patented Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process, using directed selection. We select the plant phenotype, the plant selects the team. The microbes accumulated by plants with superior phenotypes are put through an iterative selection process, which shifts the microbial community structure towards the most beneficial team.  Isolated microbial consortia are then developed into a seed treatment, drench, or granule products.

 About Us




BioConsortia, Inc. is developing highly effective microbial consortia for increasing agricultural yields. Soil and plant associated microbes interact with and supplement the functions encoded by the crop genome. Opportunities abound to exploit these plant-microbe interactions but overwhelming complexity and the huge amount of genetic diversity has hindered the realization of these by conventional R&D methods. BioConsortia has developed a revolutionary Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process for crop trait enhancement that uses iterative rounds of plant phenotyping and selection to co-select for beneficial changes in the microbiome. Isolates are obtained from the microbiome of plants expressing the desired traits and are developed as consortia for application as commercial seed treatment, drench or granule products. We have a pipeline of products for increased fertilizer utilization, growth improvement and other beneficial crop traits, such as abiotic tolerance and enhanced metabolite expression.

 Plant Traits

Microbes can influence many crop traits, giving phenotypic responses that are also seen through plant breeding. The AMS process allows for rapid identification of these teams of microbes and can work as an alternative or complement to conventional efforts by breeders and GM traits.Â 
BioConsortia is currently researching microbial consortia that deliver trait improvements for enhancing abiotic tolerance. The AMS process can be tailored to find solutions and improvements to a variety of different plant traits.
Cold and Wet Tolerance in Early Season
The development of microbial products that reduce early stress in corn is one of our key targets. To achieve this we are applying our AMS process to select cold-tolerant microbes that contribute to rapid and vigorous growth following cold stress and wet conditions.
Salt and Drought Tolerance
Drought and salinity tolerance are becoming increasingly important traits for many crops worldwide. We have identified product leads that contribute to drought and salinity tolerance in wheat and forage crops. Further work is currently under way to bring these leads through to field testing.
Biotic Resistance
The AMS process provides an effective means for selection of microbes that confer resilience to root diseases.Â  These products are not a focus of our in-house research today, but are available for further development under collaboration agreements with partners.
Repetitive Cropping Solutions
We believe that microbes can help combat the yield decline typically associated with repetitive cropping practices such as corn following corn. This will provide farmers with more options when it comes to maximizing farm productivity and profits.
Enhanced Metabolite Expression
We have demonstrated that we are able to positively impact almost any crop trait with our microbial consortia in a similar way to plant breeding. Two examples from proof-of-concept trials are increased sugar content and improved coloration.

 Product Concept Development




Microbial consortia for improving plant traits and increasing crop yields.
Our Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process links powerful plant phenotypic selection to high-throughput microbial screening and DNA sequencing. Microbes are selected as a team from superior plants and are developed into treatments consisting of the handful of microbes that are responsible for the enhanced phenotype. Due to the applied selective pressures and iterative design of the AMS process, the microbes in our treatments can tolerate chemical treatments already on the seed, are good plant colonizers and express compatibility with each other. This is a superior alternative to stacking or mixing a collection of individually identified microbes as is done conventionally.
We will supply products for increasing fertilizer use efficiency, growth improvement and enhancing other traits, such as abiotic and biotic tolerance, and metabolite expression. Our innovative approach allows for the development of products equally applicable to conventional and transgenic plants.   We are able to tailor the AMS process to develop microbial consortia products for many plant species and many of the broad spectrum of traits that are now known to be influenced by the plant and soil microbiome.  Please contact us to discuss your interest in collaboration and learn more about the opportunities that microbial consortia can bring to your business or research.

A growing, Davis-based agriculture technology company has raised $8 million in new equity funding.
BioConsortia Inc. disclosed the fully subscribed funding round in an Oct. 26 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

BioConsortia Inc.










 


The company has a pipeline of seed treatment and soil-delivered products that it's bringing to market. BioConsortia has patented technology for using beneficial groups of microbes to spur healthy soil growth around seeds, leading to higher yields in food crops, including soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, high-value fruit crops and vegetables.





BioConsortia previously raised $15 million in the spring of 2014, shortly before announcing that the company would move its headquarters to Davis in August of that year. That 2014 funding came from Khosla Ventures and Otter Capital LLC. The round was split equally between the two funds. Khosla Ventures is a Menlo Park-based venture capital fund headed by Sun Microsystems Inc. co-founder Vinod Khosla. Otter Capital is based in Palo Alto.
BioConsortia CEO Marcus Meadows-Smith was not available for comment.
Otter and Khosla didnât return calls seeking comment on whether they also invested in this latest round.
Meadows-Smith is a former CEO of AgraQuest Inc., a Davis ag technology company that was acquired by Bayer CropScience for $425 million in 2012. Meadows-Smith was the CEO of AgraQuest for the four years leading up to the Bayer sale. Otter Capital had been an investor in AgraQuest.
BioConsortia was established in 2014 as the parent company to New Zealand-based BioDiscovery Ltd.
BioDiscovery, founded in 1994, made a breakthrough discovery in 2009 with an advanced microbial selection process, and got its first funding from Khosla.




 


Meadows-Smith has said that he moved BioConsortia's headquarters to Davis because the region is a hub of biological control research and innovation.

BioConsortia Raises $12 million to Accelerate Development of Multi-Microbe Products for Agriculture | Business Wire
























































BioConsortia Raises $12 million to Accelerate Development of 
      Multi-Microbe Products for Agriculture






November 07, 2016 03:20 PM Eastern Standard Time



DAVIS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BioConsortia, Inc., innovator of microbial solutions for natural plant 
      trait enhancement and crop yield improvement, announced that it has 
      raised this year a total of $12 million for future growth. Last week, 
      BioConsortia closed an $8 million equity round of investment financed by 
      existing investors, Khosla Ventures and Otter Capital, and earlier in 
      the year raised $4 million of venture debt from Square 1 Bank, a 
      division of Pacific Western Bank.
    

      Experienced ag tech investors, Khosla Ventures and Otter Capital funded 
      BioConsortiaâs $15 million Series B round in early 2014, enabling the 
      move from New Zealand to the US, and establishing operations and 
      headquarters in Davis, California. This move refocused the research on 
      US microbes, seed genetics, more sustainable fertilizers and improved 
      agronomic practices.
    

      âWe are thrilled with the commitment and support from our existing 
      investors and Square 1 Bank. This is a busy time of year for all in the 
      ag space with field trial data coming in. Having funding in place early 
      means that we can keep our foot on the accelerator and continue to 
      expand our research capabilities, field trials program and the number of 
      beneficial traits that we are moving down our pipeline,â says 
      BioConsortia CEO, Marcus Meadows-Smith.
    

      BioConsortia continues to exploit its revolutionary Advanced Microbial 
      SelectionÂ® (AMS) process to discover advantageous microbial consortia 
      treatments for biofertilizers and biostimulants. Recently the company 
      launched several biopesticide projects to identify crucial microbial 
      solutions to combat seed and soil-borne diseases and pests.
    

      Following the addition of Dr. Hong Zhu from Bayer CropScience earlier 
      this year, the company is also further expanding its formulation and 
      fermentation team to work on products that meet the best standards for 
      seed and soil-applied solutions. Construction on new lab space at the 
      current R&D facilities is underway.
    

      Building on 2016 field trials, BioConsortia will increase its program 
      for 2017. Next yearâs trials will include important traits for drought 
      tolerance and fertilizer use efficiency on corn, soy, and wheat, as well 
      as biopesticide trials for management of soil-borne diseases in select 
      high-value vegetable crops and pests such as corn rootworm.
    

About Us


      BioConsortia, Inc. is developing effective microbial solutions that 
      enhance plant phenotypes and increase crop yields.Â WeÂ are pioneering the 
      use of directed selection in identifying teams of microbes - working 
      like plant breeders and selecting plants based onÂ targeted 
      characteristics, then isolating the associated microbial 
      community.Â OurÂ proprietaryÂ Advanced Microbial SelectionÂ® (AMS) process 
      enriches the crop microbiome, allowingÂ usÂ to identify organisms that 
      influence the expression of beneficial traits in plants.Â We 
      areÂ currently focused on products for fertilizer use efficiency, growth 
      improvement and both abiotic tolerance and biotic resistance, as 
      commercial seed treatments, liquid in-furrow products and granule 
      products for a range of crops.

Short description




Confronted with the global issues of rapid population growth, continued malnutrition, climate volatility, and dwindling exploitable resources, BioConsortia Inc. is devoted to developing solutions through enhanced crop productivity. Our respected scientists and business professionals thrive on partnerships and collaborations with like-minded people who are aware that microbial products have a major role to play in future mainstream agricultural crops. We challenge each other to be the best at finding effective answers to sustainable production of more food, feed, fiber, and fuel from our land...
 BioConsortia discovers and develops beneficial microbial consortia for improving plant traits and increasing crop yields. We are an R&D focused company seeking collaboration with partners to accelerate the development, sales and marketing of our seed treatment, drench, and granule products...
 BioConsortia, Inc. is developing highly effective microbial consortia for increasing agricultural yields. Soil and plant associated microbes interact with and supplement the functions encoded by the crop genome. Opportunities abound to exploit these plant-microbe interactions but overwhelming complexity and the huge amount of genetic diversity has hindered the realization of these by conventional R&D methods. BioConsortia has developed a revolutionary Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process for crop trait enhancement that uses iterative rounds of plant phenotyping and selection to co-select for beneficial changes in the microbiome. Isolates are obtained from the microbiome of plants expressing the desired traits and are developed as consortia for application as commercial seed treatment, drench or granule products. We have a pipeline of products for increased fertilizer utilization, growth improvement and other beneficial crop traits, such as abiotic tolerance and enhanced metabolite expression.

						What are microbial consortia?					 


Microbial consortia are elements of diverse communities of bacteria and fungi found naturally throughout the biosphere. Microbes naturally colonize plants, providing beneficial, harmful, or neutral interactions. We identify the best Microbial teams that influence the phenotype of the plant. Our process is a powerful alternative to stacking or mixing individually identified microbes, resulting in products with higher efficacy, pre-selected for their ability to colonize a plant together.

						Revolutionary R&D Platform					 


BioConsortia has developed a proprietary and patented Advanced Microbial Selection (AMS) process, using directed selection. We select the plant phenotype, the plant selects the team. The microbes accumulated by plants with superior phenotypes are put through an iterative selection process, which shifts the microbial community structure towards the most beneficial team.  Isolated microbial consortia are then developed into a seed treatment, drench, or granule products.
