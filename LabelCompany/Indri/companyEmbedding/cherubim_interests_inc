Cherubim Interests, Inc. Subsidiary Provides Progress Report On GreenPhoria Farms Construction Project 



PORTLAND, OR--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) - Budcube Construction Services ("BCS"), a subsidiary of Cherubim Interests, Inc. (OTC PINK: CHIT) ("the Company"), an expansion-stage alternative construction and real estate development company, provides progress report with respect to Greenphoria Farms' tenant finish out project.
Greenphoria Farms is a cannabis producer with twelve proprietary strains and over 30 years of cultivation expertise in the industry. The company currently has approximately 20,000 sq. feet under lease in Hillsboro Oregon, and intends on introducing its proprietary strains to the industry as early as 3rd quarter 2017.
"We have made considerable progress on the GreenPhoria Farms project," said CHIT CEO Patrick Johnson. "We have completed 100% of all required demolition, 80% completion of final prints and designs, 80% completion of floor work, and 40% completion of Truss Core wall panel preparation. The next steps will be to install Truss Core paneling on one side of the walls which will enable the plumbing, electrical and HVAC trades to begin their work and the City of Hillsboro to begin their wall inspections," said Johnson.

"As we see the front of legalization push across States and even into the platforms of the next Presidential election, companies are scrambling to catch up. The market is there, the demand is high, but the supply from legal cultivators is low. Cherubim Interests and BudCube are uniquely positioned at this perfect apex of an emerging, billion dollar market; we are positioning ourselves to meet the impending demand by supplying the facility necessary to bring existing as well as start-up companies into full scale production in a matter of months."The Memorandum of Understanding outlines a business model that CHIT and its subsidiary BudCube Cultivation Systems ("BCS") is pioneering in the real estate development and medical as well as recreational cannabis cultivation industries. The Company will lease modular turn-key cultivation facilities to new and existing market participants in a "mini-storage" or "co-op farming" scenario."First, we provide the necessary capital investment to cover any land purchase and improvements, as well as construction and deployment to location for leasing, These portable modules when combined, provide the floor space and square footage required for operations. We then deliver, install and connect the modules while providing standard operating procedures and ongoing maintenance as needed."In exchange, United Cannabis Corp. agrees to provide to BudCube Cultivations Systems fee based consulting services including:- Standard Operating Procedures - Cultivation - Inventory Control and Management Systems - Genetics Counseling and Testing Procedures - Extract Processing and Equipment Design, and - Proprietary Product Line(s)"We are excited to have Cherubim as a collaborative partner in the construction of cutting edge laboratory and cultivation facilities.

Cherubim Interests, Inc. Address To Shareholders


/EINPresswire.com/ -- DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - Dec 15, 2016) -  Cherubim Interests, Inc. (OTC PINK: CHIT) ("the Company"), an expansion-stage alternative construction and real estate development company, announces its year-end letter to shareholders.
Shareholders,
        Whilst developing our hybrid business model we initiated a stimulus program that was ultimately intended to enhance net stockholders' equity and serving as a playbook to attract and acquire investment and equity into Cherubim Interests Inc. Following this playbook, the company is delighted to provide an update on our progress and ongoing quest for added corporate and shareholder value.
Acquisitions
We successfully acquired vital revenue producing asset Victura Roofing LLC, which jumpstarted our roofing footprint in the DFW Metroplex while also unlocking an immediate expansion opportunity into the Oklahoma City region with the acquisition of Cherubim Builders Group LLC (Oklahoma). The company looks to begin expansion into the OKC region once storm season approaches in early 2017. Since the acquisition of Victura Roofing in March of 2015, the company has added a very strong cash flow to our balance sheet of over Two-Million ($2,000,000) USD.
Real Estate Development
Cherubim Inc. has also identified and subsequently put under contract to purchase real estate in Eugene, Oregon. This will thus be utilized to implement the grand opening of BudCube Cultivation Systems (BCS) "Cultivation Center" business concept in 2017.
Ventures
We have subcontracted two large-loss residential reconstruction projects totaling in excess of $400,000 USD, formed a strong partnership with United Cannabis Corp in order to design, construct and deploy mobile extraction laboratories to service the cannabis sector, and executed a Letter of Intent with Sperry Van Ness/TJF Investments.
Mobile Testing and Extraction Laboratories
The companies expect to begin construction and assembly of the laboratories in the coming weeks, and should begin shipping the first units by year-end.
Earnest Blackmon, United Cannabis' Chief Executive Officer, said of the announcement, "The opportunity to partner with BudCube is one we couldn't pass up. We leveraged their construction experience with our cultivation and processing expertise to design a fully functioning laboratory grade facility that fits in a mobile trailer. The end result is a product that not only serves our needs, but also serves a growing demand within the industry."
Blackmon went on to say, "We've spent the past year doing the groundwork, establishing relationships and securing the necessary licenses and permits to launch our operation in Jamaica with our partner CRD, and this mobile extraction lab will give us the platform we need to initiate the project. Once it's delivered, we'll have a state-of-the-art turnkey facility that will enable us to begin processing plants for terpenes and other compounds, all of which will set us up to manufacture our Prana line and Blue River Extracts products for distribution across Jamaica."
Sperry Van Ness / TJF Joint Venture
Cherubim Interests Inc. has executed a Letter of Intent with Sperry Van Ness | TJF Investments. The companies are engaged in a promising joint venture within the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex which will ultimately develop, construct, and lease several yet to be determined single-family residences which will then be divested to a pre-determined purchaser for amounts based on cap rates conducive to their respective geographic areas.
S-1 Registration Statement
On November 22, 2016 the company entered an Investment Agreement with Tangiers Global, LLC, in which Tangiers has agreed to purchase up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) of the Company's common stock via S-1 registration statement. Legal is currently drafting all documentation and the company expects to begin the filing process in early 2017. 
Debt Reduction
Cherubim Interests has been able to successfully retire both affiliate and non-affiliate debt from the company's balance sheet. Since May 31, 2015 the company has successfully eliminated over $2,000,000 of affiliate and non-affiliate debt from the company's books.
Dividend
We have also created a series of Anti-Dilutive, Convertible Preferred Shares in order to protect our majority stakeholders. This move insulates them from past, present, or future dilution in the open market by providing these anti-dilutive securities as a dividend payment. We will be addressing the dividend for all shareholders of record early in the new year.
Senior Exchange
Cherubim is looking add the net equity necessary to uplist to either NYSEMKT or NASDAQ organically through its real estate development agenda, or by prospecting for acquisitions of assets via convertible preferred stock.
Go Forward Strategy
The 'go forward' strategy is to continue to increase and add revenue through our roofing and general construction business models, further develop the BCS business concept, and adding net-equity to the balance sheet organically or by acquisition being the final task before selecting the appropriate exchange and making application for uplist.
The company is happy to report on milestones that the company has acquired valuable construction assets which have added immediate revenue production, not to mention traditional insurance restoration opportunities which remain plentiful in our specific region. On a personal note I have to say I am delighted to address our valued shareholders on the above noted milestones and would like to take the opportunity of reiterating our genuine commitment to further strengthening the company and growing corporate equity. The company wishes all of its shareholders a warm and peaceful Happy Holiday and prosperous New Year.
Warm Regards,
        Patrick Johnson
        CEO

Cherubim Interests, Inc. Subsidiary Provides Progress Report On GreenPhoria Farms Construction Project


/EINPresswire.com/ -- PORTLAND, OR--(Marketwired - Jul 25, 2017) - Budcube Construction Services ("BCS"), a subsidiary of Cherubim Interests, Inc. (OTC PINK: CHIT) ("the Company"), an expansion-stage alternative construction and real estate development company, provides progress report with respect to Greenphoria Farms' tenant finish out project.
Greenphoria Farms is a cannabis producer with twelve proprietary strains and over 30 years of cultivation expertise in the industry. The company currently has approximately 20,000 sq. feet under lease in Hillsboro Oregon, and intends on introducing its proprietary strains to the industry as early as 3rd quarter 2017.
"We have made considerable progress on the GreenPhoria Farms project," said CHIT CEO Patrick Johnson. "We have completed 100% of all required demolition, 80% completion of final prints and designs, 80% completion of floor work, and 40% completion of Truss Core wall panel preparation. The next steps will be to install Truss Core paneling on one side of the walls which will enable the plumbing, electrical and HVAC trades to begin their work and the City of Hillsboro to begin their wall inspections," said Johnson.
A video tour of the facility can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzaIniUYIoHfdGhsUkxoNzM4OUE/view?usp=sharing

	Opportunities and Strategic Alliances





	VR, thru its Member and its associated Companies (Associates), enjoy a strategic relationship(s) within the insurance restoration business sector. These Associates have acquired Companies that allow for local, regional and national growth. Several visions of growth can now become reality with alliances in funding, labor components and a state of the art project management team. These relationships bring to fruition opportunities to expand in not only our current restoration/reconstruction models, but also in commercial services. Additionally, these relationships will enhance supply chain capabilities that could garner new national program relationships with builders and general contractors as a materials/labor supplier. The recent partnerships and addition to already existing staff that has a combined 250 years in construction expertise, have allowed us to bring about the convergence of human assets that give VR and its Associates industry professionals in:





	·


	Residential and Commercial construction management,


	·


	Showroom and staff Designers,


	·


	Insurance and contractor program management,


	·


	Continuing Education programs and certification for the Insurance industry,


	·


	Materials supply relationships,


	·


	Supply chain distribution and logistics,


	·


	Multi-family property construction/re-construction opportunities,


	·


	Custom millworks product production, and


	·


	Real estate development programs.





	Current Market Opportunities





	As a result of the tornado outbreak of December 2015, along with the day to day large loss occurrences, VR has access to a catastrophe team that will target areas where wide spread destruction has happened or will occur.





	Three days after a storm believed to have damaged at least 2,000 homes and buildings, insurance companies were setting up for an extended operation in North Texas to process a flood of claims that began almost as soon as the skies cleared.





	The Insurance Council of Texas released an estimate that claims for the storm would reach $1.2 billion. That includes Dallas, Ellis, Rockwall and Collin counties, with the biggest losses coming in Garland and Rowlett, said spokesman Mark Hanna.





	In Rowlett and Garland alone it is estimated that up to 600 buildings were damaged, many of them completely leveled. Those include businesses and multi-family residences, but the majority were single-family homes. Most areas in the path of the storm suffered catastrophic damage. Entire subdivisions were obliterated and houses flattened in a large swath of the affected area.

	Cherubim Builders Group, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Victura Construction Group, Inc (CBG), and Associate of VR, when compared to 2015, has already experienced an increase of sales close to Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) US due to the weather outbreak as well as maintaining our anticipated Ten Percent (10%) growth of typical everyday claims obtained by CBG through Insurance Providers and/or Policy Holders of the Insurance Providers. Although there will be significant competition for the low hanging fruit of lightly damaged homes (roof repairs, light exterior repair, etc.), the longer term prospects for the property clean-up and rebuilding of destroyed homes will have less competition and high profit margins. Management has targeted this more-narrow market and committed resources to explore the opportunities. With a nominal increase in permanent senior staffing and use of long term contract labor forces, management estimates that VR could expect to be involved in the repair of over 250 properties over the next Twenty-Four (24) months.





	The approach for reaching this market will include the use of long-term relationships with insurance carriers, existing customers, business associates and a physical presence in the affected areas.





	Utilizing Field Contract Writing software, deployed by VR, job turnover and closing averages have substantially increased. At the end of January 2016, when including Work in Progress (WIP), VR has already exceeded the sales and profit figures for 2015.





	VR predicts that sales and profits for 2016 and 2017 should double that of 2015. The potential for growth of VR is excellent and may well grow proportionally to the number of salespeople employed. Systems in place have been designed to cope well with a much larger sales force and contract level while managing costs and the integrity of the Project and Company.

(the Company) entered into an Investment Agreement (the Investment Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1) by and among the Company, and Tangiers Global, LLC, a Wyoming limited liability company ("Tangiers"), pursuant to which Tangiers has agreed to purchase up to five million dollars ($5,000,000) of the Company's common stock to be sold at an eighty-five percent (85%) discount to the five (5) consecutive Trading Days including and immediately following the receipt of a Put Notice (the "Shares").

	On November 21, 2016, the Company issued to Tangiers that certain convertible promissory note (the Purchase Note) in the principal amount of $50,000. The Purchase Note is due June 21, 2017 (the Maturity Date). The Purchase Note bears interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The Purchase Note, together with all interest as accrued, is convertible into shares of the Companys common stock at a price equal to the lowest trading price of the Companys common stock during the 5 Trading Day period immediately prior to the date of issuance. The Purchase Note may be prepaid in whole or in part, at any time without the approval of the Holder. The Purchase Note contains representations, warranties, conditions, restrictions, and covenants of the Company that are customary in such transactions with smaller companies.

	Notes to Condensed Unaudited Financial Statements




	November 30, 2016







	NOTE 5  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES






	In accordance with AC 815, the Company has bifurcated the conversion feature of their convertible notes and recorded a derivative liability on the date each note became convertible. The derivative liability was then revalued on each reporting date. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the derivative liability. Once the loans are fully converted, the remaining derivative liability is reclassified to equity as additional paid-in capital.





	ASC 815 requires Company management to assess the fair market value of certain derivatives at each reporting period and recognize any change in the fair market value as another income or expense item. The Companys only asset or liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis is its derivative liability associated with the above convertible debt. During the period ended November 30, 2016, the Company recorded a total change in the value of the derivative liabilities of $(4,584).





	From inception to November 30, 2016 the Company has not granted any stock options.

	Our gross revenue for the three-month period ended November 30, 2016, was $408,628, compared to $0 for the same period in fiscal 2015. Revenues and cost of goods sold in the current year were the result of the acquisition of VICT in February 2016 which began revenue generating activities in June 2016.









	Operating Expenses







	The major components of our expenses for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 are outlined below:

	Cash Used In Operating Activities







	The Company had cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the amount of $133,303 and $(22,729) during the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.







	Cash From Investing Activities







	In 2016 the Company issued notes receivable of $245. In 2015 the Company purchased fixed assets of $12,500.







	Cash from Financing Activities







	In 2016, the Company has repayments of related party loan of $107,438 (proceeds of $20,646 in 2015).







	Going Concern







	The audited financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016, included in our annual report on the Form 10-K filed with Securities and Exchange Commission, have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Our company has generated no revenue since inception, and has never paid any dividends and is unlikely to pay dividends or generate substantial earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future. The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our shareholders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to achieve our operating objectives, and the attainment of profitable operations. As at November 30, 2016, our company has accumulated losses of $6,808,029 since inception. As we do not have sufficient funds for our planned operations, we will be required to raise additional funds for operations and expansion.





	Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses and the capital expenses noted above, in their report on the annual financial statements for the year ended August 31, 2016, our independent registered auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our independent registered auditors.






	17










	The continuation of our business is dependent upon us raising additional financial support. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.





	The companys operating budget to maintain the public entity reporting requirements is approximately $50,000. We continue to present to various funding groups the current opportunities in attempts to secure additional capital.





	We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our marketing plan and operations. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing and continue to be dependent upon related party/shareholder funding. The company plans to secure additional capital by the use of Notes Payable, Convertible Notes Payable, Private Placements, and partnerships and revenue sharing in future opportunities. This financing activity may lead to stock dilution and changes in control







	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements







	We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.









	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.






	Not Applicable.









	Item 4T. Controls and Procedures.







	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure






	We have adopted and maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods required under the SECs rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	The Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is its principal executive and chief financial officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period (Feb 28, 2014) covered by this Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer & CFO, has concluded the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Form 10-Q were ineffective because of comments from the SEC that required additional disclosure and restatement of other disclosed information.





	Based upon the evaluation of our controls, the chief executive officer/CFO has concluded that, the disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective providing reasonable assurance that material information relating to the company activity is communicated in sufficient detail. Although, changes have been made to provide the level of detail that is required in the company filings based upon the SEC comments, the company is not prepared at this time to remove the ineffective status of the disclosure controls and procedures. The company will continue to work in these deficiencies.






	18











	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

	.





	There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.













	PART II - OTHER INFORMATION










	ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS






	None.











	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.








	Risks and Uncertainties








	WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VALUE OF OUR PRODUCT GIVEN IT IS SET BY WORLD DEMAND AND BEYOND OUR CONTROL






	We face risks of losses in inventory value given the nature of the valuation of precious metals. The value of such metals is determined by the demand for them on a global scale and is beyond our control. While we do not anticipate there to be a significant decrease in the value of precious metals, we cannot guarantee any such change in value






	THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS.






	If we discontinue operations, you could lose your investment. Our auditors have discussed their uncertainty regarding our business operations in their audit report dated August 31, 2016. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such, we may have to cease operations and you could lose your entire investment.






	WE LACK AN OPERATING HISTORY






	There is no assurance that our future operations will result in continued profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably, our business will fail. We have very little operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success could be determined. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in generating revenues in the future. Failure to generate revenues will cause us to go out of business.






	BECAUSE OUR MANAGEMENT DOES NOT HAVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN MINING, OUR BUSINESS HAS A HIGHER RISK OF FAILURE.






	Our current directors do not have experience in the mining industry. As a result, we may not be able to recognize and take advantage of opportunities without the aid of qualified marketing and business development consultants. Our directors' decisions and choices may not be well thought out and our operations, earnings and ultimate financial success may suffer irreparable harm as a result.






	19











	OUR STOCK IS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC'S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS AND THE FINRA'S SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER'S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK






	Our stock is a penny stock. The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these l penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker- dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.





	In addition to the "penny stock" rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker- dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the National Association of Securities Dealers believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The National Association of Securities Dealers' requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.









	ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.






	During the period from September 27, 2006 (inception) to November 30, 2008, the Company issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share to its directors for total proceeds of $4,000 and 3,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.010 per share for total proceeds of $30,000. These funds we used for company initial operating expenses.





	On September 19, 2009 convertible notes in the amount of $10,000.00 were converted to 10,000,000 shares of rule- 144 restricted common stock. The value of the shares was determined by the Board of Directors at the time the Company secured ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) in funding from outside parties to fund the company, that funding was completed at .001 per share. The company issued 3,000,000 shares as approved by the Board of Directors to the President and CEO Wayne A Doss, for services valued at $3,000.00 at the same per share basis as the convertible Notes.





	During the year ended August 31, 2010 the Company also issued 3,000,000 shares of its common stock to its president for consideration of services provided. These shares were valued at $.001 per share for total consideration of $3,000. Further during the year ended August 31, 2010, the Company issued 10,000,000 shares valued at $.001 for the conversion of a $10,000 note payable. The funds were utilized for company operations. Also during the year ended November 30, 2010 the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock which were held in escrow pending the close of a share exchange. These shares were rescinded.





	On 11/14/2013 the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of five million (5,000,000) shares of rule 144 restricted common stock at a price of .015 per share value paid by the company and issued to Patrick Johnson for accepting the COO position, service as a Director and his efforts to bring a new venture and funding to the company. This issuance represented ownership of 20% of the then authorized and outstanding shares (25,000,000) of Falcon Crest Energy Inc.






	20










	On 11/26/2013 the Board of Directors authorized the conversion of old debt into Falcon Crest Energy Inc. Free Trading Common Stock in the amount of thirty three thousand dollars ($33,000) to QuoteBrand at a conversion rate of $.03 cents per share for a total of one million one hundred thousand shares (1,100,000) of Falcon Crest Energy Inc. common stock. This conversion will reduce the QuoteBrand Note Payable, issued on February 15, 2011 for cash funds received by Falcon Crest Energy Inc.





	On 7/11/14 the Board of Directors authorized the conversion of existing debt into Falcon Crest Energy Inc. Free Trading Common Stock in the amount of thirty three thousand dollars ($81,000) to QuoteBrand at a conversion rate of $.03 cents per share for a total of two million seven hundred thousand shares (2,700,000) of Falcon Crest Energy Inc. common stock. This conversion will reduce the QuoteBrand Note Payable, issued over the past several years for cash funds received by Falcon Crest Energy Inc. with a current balance due of ninety thousand seven hundred forty eight dollars ($90,700) as of August 31, 2014.
