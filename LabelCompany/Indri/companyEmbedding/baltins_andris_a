About the Author: Andris A. Baltins


These 39 stories evolved from a homework assignment of sorts. 
				After Nancy's death, the facilitator in one of my grief groups suggested that each participant write a lettera "grief letter"to the deceased. The letter, said the facilitator, was intended to finish "unfinished business."
I didn't think there was much unfinished business between Nancy and me.  I'd known Nancy since we were eight years old at Kenwood Grade School in Minneapolis.  Nancy claimed she already knew in third grade that we were destined to spend our lives together.  We were married shortly after I graduated from Yale, she from Smith College, while I was in law school, and she at the school of social work, at the University of Minnesota. 
Since Nancy was a therapist and a spiritual director, we were in the habit of "processing" a lot of stuff. I didn't think I needed to write a letter to deal with "unprocessed" emotions. But I'm a compliant student. I had a homework assignment. I wrote my first letter aboard a flight to Boston for a business meetingwhen not writing letters to bridge the space between "this world" and the "other" world, I practice business law and sit on a number of public, private and non-profit boards.
The rest of the letters were written in the study of Katagiri Roshi, the former head teacher of the Minnesota Zen Center, who died a few years before Nancy. The space was imbued with the quiet of practitioners who had been sitting zazenmeditation practiceearlier in the morning. The letters to Nancy poured out, one after another, during a six-month sabbatical from lawyering. I guess there was some unfinished business after all.
Nancy died shortly before our twenty-eight wedding anniversary.  We have two children. I continue living in Minneapolis.  I continue lawyering.  I continue writing.  And I continue loving Nancy.

Living with loss, loneliness and confusion often follows the death of a loved oneeven when grieving with awareness.
Love Letters - Reflections on Living With Loss
							by Andris A. Baltins



Winner, 2008 Nautilus Book Award
								 for world-changing books


Syren Book Company, Minneapolis: 2007, 304 pp.
								Paperback (5-3/8 x8-1/4) with flaps: $16.95
ISBN  0-929636-70-8 / 978-0-929636
Grief & Loss / Self-Help


Profound loneliness and confusion often follow the death of a loved one. Author Andris A. Baltins unexpectedly lost Nancyhis best friend, childhood sweetheart, wife, and the mother of their childrento ovarian cancer. These letters to Nancy following her death share an intimate story of recovery from loss and the enduring presence of love. 
Baltins felt called to write the book as a necessary process of working through her death, and what he was to make of himself after she had gone. Many of the author’s experiencesparticularly some of the ritualscan be of benefit to others and his wish is to share them with a larger audience who find themselves in the unthinkable situation of having lost a life-partner or someone very close to them.
All author proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to continue the charitable works of Nancy Baltins.

"Beginning with his profound introduction and through 39 letters to his deceased wife, 
							Andris Baltins faces readers against his dark wall of grief. 
							But instead of despair in sharing his intimate story of loss, 
							Baltins transcends the wall, exposing the love that remains long past physical death."
Connie Mears, "Transmuting the Darkness" New Age Retailer
