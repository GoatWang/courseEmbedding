Item Description: Wisdom Tree, New Delhi, India. Softcover. Book Condition: New. This book asks what seems like a silly question�can you teach a zebra some algebra? You may in turn ask�what kind of a question is that? How can one teach algebra to a zebra? However, that is exactly what the education system that we have inherited is attempting to do. Teachers go on to teach a subject with very little knowledge of the real subject�the student. Our schools remind us of the story of a sports school for animals. Here the teacher is employed to train animals to compete for the Animal Olympics. The teacher looks at a rabbit and teaches it to fly. Then he gets hold of an eagle and forces the bird to run. The elephant is asked to swim and the tortoise is advised to practice a high jump. Finally, after fifteen years of training is over, the duck is declared the Olympic champion. Why? The duck can do a little bit of hopping, flying, jumping and swimming�a jack of all trades and master of none. Think of what�s happening in our schools today. Students, like the duck in the story are asked to do a bit of everything with no deep knowledge of anything. Yet, true education is about achieving mastery�it is about perfecting ourselves as a species. Each one of us was created in our unique human shape and form. We were not mass manufactured in a factory. Our mission in life is therefore to create and to give birth to our true genius�something that we are born to do.Printed Pages: 168.

Item Description: Wisdom Tree, India, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. This book asks what seems like a silly question--can you teach a zebra some algebra? You may in turn ask--what kind of a question is that? How can one teach algebra to a zebra? However, that is exactly what the education system that we have inherited is attempting to do. Teachers go on to teach a subject with very little knowledge of the real subject--the student. Our schools remind us of the story of a sports school for animals. Here the teacher is employed to train animals to compete for the Animal Olympics. The teacher looks at a rabbit and teaches it to fly. Then he gets hold of an eagle and forces the bird to run. The elephant is asked to swim and the tortoise is advised to practice a high jump. Finally, after fifteen years of training is over, the duck is declared the Olympic champion. Why? The duck can do a little bit of hopping, flying, jumping and swimming--a jack of all trades and master of none. Think of what s happening in our schools today. Students, like the duck in the story are asked to do a bit of everything with no deep knowledge of anything. Yet, true education is about achieving mastery--it is about perfecting ourselves as a species. Each one of us was created in our unique human shape and form. We were not mass manufactured in a factory. Our mission in life is therefore to create and to give birth to our true genius--something that we are born to do.

Item Description: Wisdom Tree, New Delhi, India. Hardcover. Book Condition: New. Dust Jacket Condition: New. Every Chandragupta needs a Chanakya. Why? We all need our missing halves to fulfill us. The day needs the night to refresh itself through sleep. The night needs the day to awaken to the world of new possibilities. When you are immature, you want maturity to be by your side. When you are too mature, you need somebody adventurous and innocent to be with you to learn how to mature. When you have a restless Arjuna, you need the stabilising wisdom of Krishna. When you have a Krishna, you need an Arjuna to awaken and arise to act on that wisdom. So, these complementarities have to come together�like day and night; spring and winter. A teacher can bring that missing touch in the evolving life of a student.Printed Pages: 168.  Bookseller Inventory # 106750

The Times of India: Cognizant’s President of Technology Solutions Talks About the Company’s IT Infrastructure Services Business 

“We do not view infrastructure services through the traditional lens of labor arbitrage,” says Debashis Chatterjee.
Chatterjee reveals that the company is leveraging its consulting and SMAC (social, mobility, analytics and cloud) capabilities to deliver infrastructure services. He informs that Cognizant has developed platforms such as Cloud360, OnTarget, and HybridIT to offer cloud-based services to enterprise computing and storage.
Cognizant, he points out, owns data centers both in the U.S. (Chandler, Arizona and Sterling, Virginia) and Europe (Slough, UK, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands), apart from leveraging partner-owned data centers.
Chatterjee says that there are significant market opportunities for infrastructure services in the U.S. and more so in Europe due to competitive and cost pressures. “Most enterprise customers have currently exhausted several levers of business differentiation and understand the growing significance of technology in optimizing costs, enhancing customer engagement, and gaining market share,” he adds.

Computer News Middle East: Cognizant’s President of Technology Solutions Talks About Enterprise Application Integration

“With many businesses taking to the cloud on their own, centralizing security policies for such initiatives and ensuring implementation by the system integrator/SaaS provider becomes very important,” says Debashis Chatterjee. “In classic B2B transactions such as EDI and managed file transfer, enterprises need to be constantly monitored to ensure that communications with trading partners are conducted securely and are not subject to breaches.”
Chatterjee adds, “An increased use of mobile, cloud solutions and API-based integration to SAAS platforms poses new challenges for managing and securing these services, while still meeting delivery SLAs, performance, scalability, and so on. Complex and wide-ranging services that include cloud or SaaS platforms and external partner services require securing and efficiently managing such critical services and often, addressing compliance and risk requirements as well. In this context, CIOs need to ensure that applications are available on cloud and that all transactions are conducted securely. Enterprises should not be exposed to attacks such as DOS (denial of service), which could pull down the business.”
Chatterjee is all too aware of the role of EAI projects play in terms of business-IT alignment. “While traditionally these investments were thought to be a cost center, CIOs are today linking the cost of investment to revenue increases, decrease in lead time on various business processes, elimination of waste and lost revenues,” he says.
