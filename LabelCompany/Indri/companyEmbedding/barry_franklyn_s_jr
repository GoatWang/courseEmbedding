Departure of Franklyn S. Barry, Jr          Anyone want to speculate as to the departure of Franklyn S. Barry, Jr, being a plus or minus for the future of AEMD?   What is the most plausible explanation as to why he is leaving now?   A Google search of Mr Barry produces such info as:  “Mr. Franklyn S. Barry, Jr. served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of Aethlon Medical Inc. (formerly, Bishop Equities Inc.,) from March 10, 1999 to May 31, 2001. Mr. Barry served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Hemex from April 1997 to May 31, 2001. From 1994 to April 1997, he was a private consultant. Previously, he served as the President of Sheridan Companies and President of Ingram Software. Earlier, He served as the President of Fisher Price Toys and as co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Software Distribution Services, which today operates as Ingram Micro-D. He has over 25 years of experience in managing and building companies. He has been a Director of Barrister Global Services Network Inc., since 1991, Aethlon Medical Inc., since March 10, 1999 and Merchants Mutual Insurance Company since 1981. He served as a Director of Merchants Insurance Group, Inc. from 1986 to 1994.”
