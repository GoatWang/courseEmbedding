Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.

My Life, Our Future is a nationwide campaign that  offers free genotyping to people with hemophilia A  and B, as well as potential and confirmed carriers  of the disorder.




Making knowledge hereditary








My Life, Our Future



My Life, Our Future is a U.S.-wide campaign that increases the understanding of hemophilia today, while helping to advance the breakthrough treatments of tomorrow. The program, which offers free genotyping to people with hemophilia A and B, as well as potential and confirmed carriers, is the largest genetic project ever conducted in hemophilia. It has created the world’s largest research repository of its kind – a collection of hemophilia data and samples for scientific study. This rich resource is now available to qualified scientists to increase our understanding of the disease and its complications, and potentially to develop new therapies.
At Bioverativ, we feel a responsibility to work together with the hemophilia community to create progress for patients, and we are proud to collaborate with leaders in this community, including the American Thrombosis and Hemostasis Network, Bloodworks Northwest, and the National Hemophilia Foundation, to offer this program and work together toward innovation.
Through genotyping – a blood test that identifies the genetic code responsible for an individual’s hemophilia – My Life, Our Future may provide patients with meaningful information, including a window into bleeding severity, clues to inhibitor risk, and steps toward adopting better treatments to manage care. We believe that genotyping is the key that may be able to unlock the mysteries of hemophilia, and that My Life, Our Future addresses a long-standing unmet need.
The My Life, Our Future Research Repository is the first initiative of its kind to link the genetic and clinical data of many people with hemophilia in the U.S., providing an unprecedented resource for researchers. Of the more than 6,600 people who have consented to participate so far, nearly 650 have been women and girls confirmed to carry a defective clotting factor gene, providing them with information to better manage their own health and aid in family planning decisions.

Biogen stock surges nearly 6% on Q2 profit, revenue beats
Biogen Inc.  shares surged 5.8% in premarket trade Tuesday after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue beats. Earnings for the latest quarter fell to $863 million, or $4.07 per share, from $1.05 billion, or $4.79 per share in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings-per-share were $5.04, compared with the FactSet consensus of $4.37. Revenue rose to $3.08 billion from $2.89 billion, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.81 billion. Biogen, which spun out its hemophilia business into the company Bioverativ  in the first-quarter, said it excluded all hemophilia revenues from the second quarter of 2016. The latest results include a 5% increase in multiple sclerosis revenues as compared with the prior year, a 13% increase in revenue for the multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera as compared with the prior year and $203 million in revenue for the spinal muscular atrophy therapy Spinraza, which was only approved at the very end of 2016. Biogen also raised its 2017 financial guidance due to "faster than anticipated adoption of Spinraza in the U.S.," increasing revenue outlook to about $11.5 to $11.8 billion and EPS outlook to between $20.80 and $21.40, up from $20.45 to $21.25. Biogen shares have slumped 0.8% over the last three months, compared with a 3.4% rise in the S&P 500 .

					Full Description



Bioverativ Inc. (Bioverativ) is a biotechnology company. The Company is focused on the discovery, research, development and commercialization of therapies for the treatment of hemophilia and other blood disorders. The Company markets approximately two products, including ELOCTATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein], and ALPROLIX [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Fc Fusion Protein], extended half-life clotting-factor therapies for the treatment of hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively. ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX use a process known as Fc fusion to link recombinant factor VIII and factor IX, respectively, to a protein fragment in the body known as Fc. The fusion of the factor with the Fc protein fragment uses a naturally occurring pathway and is designed to extend the half-life of the factor thereby making the product last longer in a person's blood than various factor therapies. The Company collaborates with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi) to develop and commercialize ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX globally. The Company has rights to commercialize ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX in the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia and all other markets excluding Sobi's commercialization territory. Sobi's commercialization territory includes Europe, Russia and certain countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East. The Company has various programs intended to support its marketed products and a product pipeline for the creation and delivery of new therapies, which include research activities relating to its marketed products, including ongoing and planned post-marketing studies on Fc fusion technology on long-term joint health, immunogenicity and immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, and research activities relating to new products, including discovery and preclinical programs studying longer-acting extended half-life hemophilia product candidates, non-factor products to treat hemophilia (such as bi-specific antibody technology) and gene therapies for both hemophilia A and B. The Company also has ongoing research programs relating to sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. The Company’s pipeline includes BIVV 001(rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN), BIVV 002 (rFIXFc-XTEN), Gene Therapy Programs, Bi-Specific Antibody Program and Other Blood Disorders. BIVV 001(rFVIIIFc-VWF-XTEN) is a preclinical program of the combination of its recombinant factor VIII-VWF fusion protein with proprietary XTEN technology licensed from Amunix. The product candidate is being developed with the objective of achieving once weekly or less frequent dosing by intravenous administration in patients with hemophilia A. BIVV 002 (rFIXFc-XTEN) is a preclinical program for a recombinant factor IX replacement product using XTEN technology exploring the use of subcutaneous dosing for patients with hemophilia B with the objective of achieving once weekly or less frequent dosing. The Company is engaged in collaborating with Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele S.r.l. to develop gene therapies for hemophilia A and B. Its Bi-Specific Antibody Program is a preclinical program to develop a non-factor bi-specific antibody for the treatment of patients with hemophilia A with inhibitors and the general hemophilia A population. The Company is pursuing opportunities in sickle cell disease.

Bioverativ Inc. is an American multinational biotechnology, specializing in the discovery, development, and delivery of therapies for the treatment of haemophilia. Bioverativ competes with Baxalta, Pfizer and Novo Nordisk.[2]
History[edit]
In May 2016 Biogen announced that it would spin off its hemophilia drug business (Eloctate and Alprolix) into a separate public company.[3] In August, the company announced that the spun off company would be called Bioverativ in order to show heritage with Biogen.[4] The company will trade on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol BIVV[5][6] and will look to be spun off in early 2017.[7] On December 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bioverativ's registration statement, with the official separation date of the two companies being pegged at February 2017.[8] In February, Biogen investors will receive a special dividend of one share of Bioverativ stock for every two shares of Biogen stock held as of January 17.[9] Bioverativ began trading on January 12, 2017.[10]
In May 2017, the company announced it would acquire True North Therapeutics for $825 million, strengthening Bioverativ's pipeline with the acquisition of TNT009 – a treatment for cold agglutinin disease.[11]
Products[edit]
The company has two current products; Alprolix and Eloctate, both products provided combined revenues of $604 million in 2015, and $640 million in the first nine months of 2016 (contributing to ~6% of Biogens' total revenue.[10]

Biogen Announces Bioverativ as Name of New Hemophilia-Focused Company | Business Wire
























































Biogen Announces Bioverativ as Name of New Hemophilia-Focused Company




Bioverativ Will Focus on Accelerating Innovation for People Living 
      with Hemophilia and Other Blood Disorders


Initial Form 10 Filing Expected Later This Week


On Track for Separation into Two Publicly Traded Companies in Early 
      2017






August 09, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Biogen 
      (NASDAQ: BIIB) today announced that Bioverativ will be the name of the 
      standalone, publicly-traded global biotechnology company that it expects 
      to launch in early 2017. Bioverativ will be focused on the discovery, 
      research, development and commercialization of treatments for hemophilia 
      and other blood disorders. Following completion of the spin-off, 
      Bioverativ plans to trade under the symbol BIVV on the NASDAQ Stock 
      Market.
    

      “As an independent and focused company, we believe that Bioverativ will 
      be uniquely positioned to drive progress and advance the standard of 
      care for people living with hemophilia,” said John G. Cox, Chief 
      Executive Officer of Bioverativ, and Biogen’s former Executive Vice 
      President, Pharmaceutical Operations & Technology. “Working closely with 
      the hemophilia community, we hope to transform lives by accelerating 
      innovation for people and caregivers living with hemophilia.”
    

      “The new company’s name creates a clear connection to our Biogen 
      heritage and biotech focus. It also conveys our commitment to actively 
      working with patients, caregivers, health care professionals and 
      advocacy leaders to create progress where patients need it most,” Mr. 
      Cox continued.
    

      Bioverativ will continue commercialization of ELOCTATE® and ALPROLIX®, 
      indicated for the treatment of hemophilia A and B, respectively, under 
      Biogen's existing collaboration agreement with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum 
      AB (publ)(Sobi). After the spin-off, Bioverativ expects to continue 
      development of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, including conducting studies to 
      explore the potential benefits of Fc fusion technology on long-term 
      joint health, immunogenicity and immune tolerance induction in 
      hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors.
    

      Bioverativ will also focus on advancing pipeline programs that address 
      areas of unmet need in hemophilia and other blood disorders, including 
      programs studying longer-acting factor therapies that utilize XTEN 
      technology, a non-factor bi-specific antibody program to treat patients 
      with hemophilia A and patients with inhibitors, and gene therapy 
      programs for hemophilia A and B, as well as ongoing research relating to 
      sickle cell disease.
    

      Biogen announced its intent to spin-off its hemophilia business in May 
      2016. The spin-off is planned to be completed in early 2017, subject to 
      the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, final 
      approval of Biogen’s board of directors, receipt of a favorable opinion 
      with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the 
      effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement that is filed with the 
      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The initial Form 10 
      registration for Bioverativ is expected to be filed with the SEC later 
      this week. The Bioverativ logo and visual identity will be unveiled at a 
      later date.

Safe HarborThis press release contains forward-looking 
      statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to the 
      proposed spin-off of Biogen’s hemophilia business, such as the 
      completion and timing of the proposed spin-off and the anticipated 
      benefits and business operations of Bioverativ following completion of 
      the proposed spin-off, and plans with respect to anticipated filings of 
      Bioverativ with the SEC. These forward-looking statements may be 
      accompanied by such words as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” 
      “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” 
      “project,” “target,” “will” and other words and terms of similar 
      meaning. You should not place undue reliance on these statements.
    

      These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from those reflected in such statements, 
      including, without limitation, risks that the proposed spin-off will be 
      completed in a timely manner or at all; risks of failure to satisfy any 
      conditions to the proposed spin-off; risks of failure of the proposed 
      spin-off to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income 
      tax purposes; uncertainty of whether the anticipated benefits of the 
      spin-off can be achieved; risks associated with litigation that may 
      arise as a result of the proposed spin-off; risks of unexpected costs or 
      delays; and risks and uncertainties associated with the development and 
      commercialization of products and product candidates that may impact or 
      alter anticipated business plans, strategies, objectives, and capital 
      structure. The foregoing sets forth many, but not all, of the factors 
      that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations in any 
      forward-looking statement. Investors should consider this cautionary 
      statement, as well as the risk factors identified in our most recent 
      annual or quarterly report and in other reports we have filed with the 
      U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. These statements are based on 
      our current beliefs and expectations and speak only as of the date of 
      this press release. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly 
      update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future developments or otherwise.

Bioverativ is a global biotechnology company  dedicated to transforming the lives of people living  with hemophilia and other blood disorders. 




Creating meaningful progress for patients








Our Purpose



At Bioverativ, we are dedicated to transforming the lives of people with hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease and other rare blood disorders. As an independent biotechnology company spun out of Biogen’s hemophilia business, we bring a strong legacy of innovation, world-class science, and commitment to the rare blood disorders community. We are united by a singular purpose: to create progress where patients need it most.
We believe that great science conquers the toughest medical obstacles, and we are inspired to push scientific boundaries to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people with rare blood disorders.










Beginning with hemophilia, we will lead by doing what’s right for patients and those who care for them, and by actively working with the blood disorders community to accelerate innovation and develop life-changing treatments.

			 


			John G. Cox, CEO
		





Our hemophilia therapies were the first major advancements in the treatment of hemophilia A and B in nearly two decades, and are the first extended half-life clotting factors introduced to patients. We will continue to explore the potential benefits and better understand the science of these therapies in areas of serious need, including immune tolerance induction in hemophilia patients who develop inhibitors, long-term joint health and women with bleeding disorders.
In the same spirit as in hemophilia, we will carry forward a commitment to significantly impact the lives of people with other rare blood disorders, including cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia.

Bioverativ’s research pipeline shows our scientists’ commitment to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients, including hemophilia, sickle cell disorders. 




Moving science forward to benefit patients








Our Pipeline



Leaders in their fields, our scientists are deeply committed to the discovery and development of new medicines to address areas of serious need for patients. Leveraging our deep understanding of the biology of hemostasis gained over 15 years of research, we plan to accelerate the development of our innovative pipeline of programs in hemophilia, cold agglutinin disease, sickle cell disease, beta thalassemia, and other blood disorders.
Our pipeline includes hemophilia programs that have been designed to provide less-frequent prophylactic dosing for hemophilia A and subcutaneous dosing for hemophilia B, and gene therapy programs for hemophilia A and B. 
It also includes programs to address cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition for which there are no approved therapies. BIVV009 (formerly TNT009) is the only therapy in development that is designed to selectively inhibit the classical complement pathway of the immune system. BIVV009 targets C1s, thereby impacting the central mechanism of this disease.
We are also pursuing several approaches that seek to target the root cause of sickle cell disease, a profoundly debilitating disease that is linked to a shorter life expectancy and has few treatment options. Just as we have done in hemophilia, we hope to bring forward new medicines that meaningfully advance the treatment of people with sickle cell disease.
