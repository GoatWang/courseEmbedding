Mineral Reserves & Resources



Standard : Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves and Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources have been estimated in accordance with the definitions of these terms adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (“CIM”) in November 2005 and incorporated in National Instrument 43-101, “Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects” (“NI 43-101”), by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Estimates of coal reserves and resources have been prepared and classified using guidance from the Geological Survey of Canada Paper 88-21. Classification terminology for coal conforms to CIM definitions incorporated into NI 43-101. Mineral Resources are reported separately from and do not include that portion of the Mineral Resources that is classified as Mineral Reserves. That portion of Mineral Resource which is not classified as Mineral Reserve does not have demonstrated economic value.
Definitions : The CIM Definition standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves provide as follows:
A Mineral Resource  is a concentration or occurrence of diamonds, natural solid inorganic material, or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals, coal, and industrial minerals in or on the earth’s crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed, but not verified, geological and grade continuity. The estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed.
A Measured Mineral Resource  is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape, and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters, to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.
A Mineral Reserve    is the economically mineable part of a Measured or Indicated Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified. A Mineral Reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.
A Probable Mineral Reserve  is the economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction can be justified.
A Proven Mineral Reserve  is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate information on mining, processing, metallurgical, economic, and other relevant factors that demonstrate, at the time of reporting, that economic extraction is justified.






Mineralized material



Mineralized material is the projection of mineralization in rock based on geological evidence and assumed continuity. It may or may not be supported by sampling but is supported by geological, geochemical, geophysical or other data. This material may or may not have economically recoverable mineralization.






back to top




O


Open pit



A mine where the minerals are mined entirely from the surface.






Ore



Rock, generally containing metallic and non-metallic minerals that can be mined and processed at a profit.






Orebody



A sufficiently large amount of ore that can be mined economically.






Ounces



Troy ounces of a fineness of 999.9 parts per 1,000 parts.






Oxide ore



Mineralized rock in which some of the original minerals have been oxidized. Oxidation tends to make the ore more amenable to cyanide solutions so that minute particles of gold will be readily dissolved.






back to top




R


Reclamation



The process by which lands disturbed as a result of mining activity are reclaimed back to a beneficial land use. Reclamation activity includes the removal of buildings, equipment, machinery and other physical remnants of mining, closure of tailings impoundments, leach pads and other mine features, and contouring, covering and revegetation of waste rock piles and other disturbed areas.






Recovery 



A term used in process metallurgy to indicate the proportion of valuable material obtained in the processing of an ore. It is generally stated as a percentage of valuable metal in the ore that is recovered compared to the total valuable metal present in the ore.






Refining



The final stage of metal production in which impurities are removed from the molten metal. 






Reverse circulation drilling



drilling that produces rock chips rather than core. The chips are forced by air to surface through a double-walled drill pipe and are collected for examination.






Royalty



An amount of money paid at regular intervals by the lessee or operator of an exploration or mining property to the owner of the ground. Generally, it will be based on a certain amount per tonne or a percentage of the total production or profits. Also, the fee paid for the right to use a patented process.






back to top




S


Shaft



A vertical passageway to an underground mine for ventilation, moving personnel, equipment, supplies and material including ore and waste rock.






Skarn



Name for the metamorphic rocks surrounding an igneous intrusive where it comes in contact with a limestone or dolostone formation.






Stockpile



Broken ore heaped on surface or prepared areas underground, pending treatment or shipment.






Stope



An area in an underground mine where ore is mined.






Strike length



The longest horizontal dimension of an orebody or zone of mineralization.






back to top




T


Tailings



The material that remains after all economically and technically recoverable precious metals have been removed from the ore during processing.






Total cash costs



Total cash costs are calculated in accordance with The Gold Institute Production Cost Standard and include site costs for all mining (excluding deferred stripping costs), processing and administration, royalties and production taxes, but are exclusive of amortization, reclamation, financing costs, capital costs and exploration costs. See “Non-GAAP Performance Measures”.






back to top




V


Vein



A fissure, fault or crack in a rock filled by minerals that have traveled upwards from some deep source.






Visible gold



Native gold which is discernible, in a hand specimen, to the unaided eye.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT
Certain information contained in this Website, including any information as to IAMGOLD's future financial or operating performance, constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "contemplate", "target", "plan", "intends", "continue", "budget", "estimate", "may", "will", "schedule" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by IAMGOLD, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to : fluctuations in the currency markets (such as the Canadian and Australian dollars versus the U.S. dollar); fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodities (such as silver, copper, diesel fuel and electricity); changes in U.S. dollar interest rates or gold lease rates that could impact the mark to market value of outstanding derivative instruments and ongoing payments/receipts under interest rate swaps and variable rate debt obligations; risks arising from holding derivative instruments (such as credit risk, market liquidity risk and mark to market risk); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Ghana, Nicaragua, Honduras, South Africa, Bolivia, Mexico, Burkina Faso, Ecquador or other countries in which IAMGOLD does or may carry on business in the future; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, IAMGOLD; IAMGOLD's ability to successfully integrate acquisitions; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities; the speculative nature of gold exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses and permits; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; adverse changes in IAMGOLD's credit rating; and contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect IAMGOLD's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, IAMGOLD. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements contained in this Website are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to IAMGOLD's most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a discussion of some of the risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements.
Except as required by law, IAMGOLD expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, events or otherwise.

Iamgold, Scotts Miracle-Gro, Burlington Stores, Target and Dollar General highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - June 26, 2017 - Zacks Equity Research Iamgold Corporation  (NYSE:  IAG  - Free Report  ) as the Bull of the Day, Scotts Miracle-Gro  (NYSE:  SMG  - Free Report  ) as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Burlington Stores Inc.  (NYSE:  BURL  - Free Report  ), Target Corporation  (NYSE:  TGT  - Free Report  ) and Dollar General Corporation  (NYSE:  DG  - Free Report  ). Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:   Bull of the Day    :  Your tech-heavy portfolio probably needs a little bit of insurance and with the market bumping up against new highs now is a great time to add it. Iamgold Corporation  (NYSE:  IAG  - Free Report  ) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and carries a Growth Style Score of "A" which is just what I normally like to see. Let's take a look at why this is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in today's Bull of the Day. Insurance Play Maybe you have been riding the wave of higher tech stock prices over the last several weeks. Maybe you are seeing the run now take place in biotech names as well. And just maybe all that speculation in the market tells you that an insurance play for about 5% of your portfolio makes sense. This is just that sort of stock! Description IAMGOLD Corp is an international gold exploration and mining company based in Canada. It holds a 38% stake in the Sadiola Gold Mine and a 40% stake in the Yatela Gold Mine. Both are located in Mali, West Africa. Measured and indicated resources at Sadiola and Yatela are 5.5 million ounces of gold (including reserves of 5.2 million ounces). Inferred resources are 5.9 million ounces. IAMGOLD is actively exploring highly prospective ground in Africa and South America. Earnings The last four earnings reports have seen two beats and two meets. The beats, however, have been huge but most of that is due to the small base. Estimate Revisions Estimates for this year are moving in the right direction with the Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from a loss of about a nickel to a loss of two cents. Next year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate shows this company turning the corner into profitability. If we are still in this stock in 1Q18, it should lift considerably as it will be posting positive earnings. Valuation Without positive earnings, we do not have a PE ratio to fall back on. Instead, we have to look to the price to book and price to sales to get a better idea of where we stand. The price to book for this gold miner is 1.06x so the value-minded investors have to like that. The price to sales multiple of 2.4x is also nice and low. The key here will be growth and can they deliver more than expected in terms of ounces. That is hard to know, but keep in mind that we are using this stock as a defensive tool as well.  The Best & Worst of Zacks  Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 "Strong Buys" free of charge. From 1988 through 2015 this list has averaged a stellar gain of +25% per year. Plus, you may download 220 Zacks Rank #5 "Strong Sells." Even though this list holds many stocks that seem to be solid, it has historically performed 6X worse than the market.    See these critical buys and sells free       >>     Bear of the Day  : It is officially summer and that means you are spending a little more time on your lawn and your flowers... or are you? A recent miss by Scotts Miracle-Gro  (NYSE:  SMG  - Free Report  ) makes me feel like the wetter than normal spring meant a slow start to planting season. Let's take a look at the recent quarter and what the expectations have adjusted to. When there is a miss like this, the negative revision to earnings estimates is the majority of the reason this stock slipped to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and is the Bear of the Day today. Recent Miss On May 2, the company posted earnings per share of $2.78, but that was $0.15 below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93. That translates to a 5.1% negative earnings surprise. Description The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Scotts Company LLC, is the world's largest marketer of branded consumer products for lawn and garden care, with products for professional horticulture as well. The Company's brands are the most recognized in the industry. In the U.S., the Company's Scotts, Miracle-Gro, Ortho and Smith & Hawken brands are market-leading in their categories, as is the consumer Roundup brand, which is marketed in North America and most of Europe exclusively by Scotts and owned by Monsanto. In the U.S. the Company operates Scotts LawnService0, the second largest residential lawn care service business. In Europe, the Company's brands include Weedol, Pathclear, Evergreen, Levington, Miracle-Gro, KB, Fertiligene and Substral. Its customers include home improvement centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, food and drug stores, commercial nurseries and greenhouses, and specialty crop growers. Earnings The last four earnings reports have hit or miss, with the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate two times and missing the mark two times as well. Estimate Revisions Estimates for this year are moving in the wrong direction with the Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from $4.30 90 days ago to the current level of $4.14. The same can be said of the 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate which moved from $4.80 to $4.60 over the same time period. This move lower in earnings estimates is the key reason why this stock is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) as well as the reason for it being the Bear of the Day today.  The Best & Worst of Zacks  Today you are invited to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 "Strong Buys" free of charge. From 1988 through 2015 this list has averaged a stellar gain of +25% per year. Plus, you may download 220 Zacks Rank #5 "Strong Sells." Even though this list holds many stocks that seem to be solid, it has historically performed 6X worse than the market.

In fact, the sector has been struggling with soft store and mall traffic trends and a tough retail landscape, due to the change in consumer shopping preferences and the rise of competition with pure-play eCommerce names like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN). Not only this, the players in the sector have also been hit hard by major economic challenges like the strong U.S. dollar, volatile commodity costs and global uncertainty. The volatility in U.S. dollar for quite some time now has been hurting retailers with worldwide operations. This scenario has largely weighed on the performance of retailers, particularly Apparel and Department Stores. In a bid to stay in the rat race and be ahead of the curve, these retailers are heavily investing in building upon its eCommerce and omni-channel functionalities. At the same time, they remain focused on optimizing store fleet and are eventually cutting down upon brick-and-mortar store counts. Also, these companies have taken up an aggressive remodeling of stores to attract traffic. Some retailers that are concentrating on optimizing store fleet include Macy's Inc. (M) and American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO) and J. C. Penney Company Inc. (JCP). Further, DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS) also announced plans to bring a slowdown in its store growth plan. However, the game is still not over for this resilient sector, which is placed at the bottom 19% of the Zacks Sector Rank (13 out of 16). The sector still holds potential given the favorable economic indicators including decelerating unemployment rate and gradual housing market recovery. Apart from uplifting the economy, these factors play a key role in reviving consumer confidence that should improve consumer spending. Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date. The sector registered growth of 17% while the S&P 500 index gained 9.2%. While most industries under the Retail sector have been in the red, there is one industry that is booming - the Discount Stores. In such a volatile background, let's see what makes the Discount Stores stand out.  Why Discount Stores are Performing Well?  Well, actually it is not surprising that the Discount Stores are doing well. Yes, the unique off-price model of these stores makes it a favorite shopping place for today's value focused customers, particularly millennials. These stores offer attractive discounts, selling products at lower and reasonable prices when compared with traditional retail outlets. Further, these stores can easily adjust or slash price to react to a situation due to efficient distribution methods. This makes Discount Stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios. These factors have kept the Discount Store format shielded from the current turmoil in the retail segment. Notably, the Retail-Discount Stores  industry is at the top 38% of the Zacks Sector Rank (97 out of 256). This calls for investing in the Retail-Discount Stores space. Here we have highlighted three Discount Stores stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score  of "A" or "B". These stocks are backed by sound fundamentals, surging share price and a track record of better-than-expected results. First on the list is Burlington Stores Inc.  (NYSE:  BURL  - Free Report  ), with a long-term earnings growth rate of 15.9% and a VGM Score of "A". The stock increased about 32.8% in the past one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Retail-Discount Stores industry that declined 8.3%. This retailer of branded apparel delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 22.6% in the trailing four quarters and flaunts a Zacks Rank #2. You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Another lucrative option is Target Corporation  (NYSE:  TGT  - Free Report  ), which has a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4% and a VGM Score of "A". This general merchandise retailer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2. We note that in the last three months, the stock has declined 4.6%, narrower than the Zacks categorized Retail-Discount Stores industry's fall of 6.1%. Investors can count on Dollar General Corporation  (NYSE:  DG  - Free Report  ), a discount retailer providing various consumable products in the southern, southwestern, midwestern, and eastern U.S. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.6%. Further, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 1.4% in the trailing four quarters and has a VGM Score of "A". In the last three months, this Zacks Rank #2 stock has exhibited a bullish run and advanced roughly 2.4%, while the Zacks categorized Retail-Discount Stores industry lost 6.1%.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Operations[edit]
IAMGOLD has an annual production of approximately 800,000 ounces of gold from operations in North America, South America, and West Africa.
In Q1 2017 IAMGOLD reported attributable gold production of 214,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $992 per ounce sold. For the quarter the Company posted a net loss of $18 million. [2]
Mines[edit]
The following mines provide attributable gold production to the company:

The Essakane gold mine, acquired by IAMGOLD from Orezone Resources in 2009, located in Burkina Faso. IAMGOLD holds a 90% interest, the remainder belonging to the government of Burkina Faso.[3]
The Rosebel gold mine, acquired by IAMGOLD through its merger with Cambior in 2006, located in Suriname. IAMGOLD holds a 95% interest, the remainder belonging to the government of Suriname.
The Westwood gold mine in Abitibi, Quebec, located in the Canadian province of Quebec. IAMGOLD holds a 100% interest through its Doyon Division subsidiary.
The Sadiola gold mine in Mali, operated by joint-venture partner AngloGold Ashanti. IAMGOLD holds a 41% working interest.
The Yatela Mine gold mine in western Mali, about 25 kilometres north of the Sadiola Mine on an adjoining mining permit and now being put into closure. IAMGOLD holds a 41% interest.

2016 Exploration and Development Projects[edit]
The Company is exploring and progressing feasibility studies on a number of options. Projects of note include, but are not limited to:

The Boto Gold project in Senegal
The Côté Gold project in Northeastern Ontario
The Pitangui project in Minas Gerais, Brazil
The Diakha project in Mali. The project is a joint venture with Merrex Gold.
The Eastern Borosi project in Nicaragua. The project is a joint venture with Calibre Mining.
The Monster Lake project in Quebec. The project is a joint venture with TomaGold.
The Camp Caiman project in French Guiana, currently on hold.

At the end of 2014, IAMGOLD held an 86% interest in Euro Ressources, a French corporation, which in turn held a royalty on IAMGOLD's Rosebel mine, and 14% of Colombus Gold's outstanding shares. Colombus Gold is focused on the development of the Montagne d'Or Gold Deposit, located on the Paul Isnard concession in French Guiana, which hosts an NI43-101 in-pit gold resource of 3.9 million ounces at approximately 1.5 g/t.
In January 2017 IAMGOLD released a positive preliminary economic assessment for the Côté Gold project that outlined a 21-year mine life producing an average of 302,000 ounces of gold annually at average total cash costs of $564/oz and all-in sustaining costs of $686/oz.[4]
In June 2017 IAMGOLD released a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for its Côté Gold Project in Northern Ontario that outlined proven and probable gold reserves of 5.9 million ounces. The study estimated a 17-year mine life producing an average of 320,000 ounces of gold annually.[5]
Past Mines (Divested and Closed)[edit]
IAMGOLD and its predecessor companies have existed since 1986. Notable divested and closed mines from IAMGOLD and its predecessor companies include:

The Niobec underground mine near Chicoutimi in the Canadian province of Quebec. This mine is North America's only source of pyrochlore, the primary niobium ore, and one of only three major producers of niobium. Sold to Magris Resources on Jan 22nd 2015.
The Mouska gold mine in Abitibi, Quebec, closed in 2014.
The Doyon gold mine, an open-pit and underground operation in Abitibi, Quebec, closed in 2008. The mill has since been refurbished and upgraded to handle the Westwood mine's ore, while treated material is disposed of in the old Doyon open pit.
Stakes in the Tarkwa Mine and Damang Mine in Ghana (divested in 2011).
The Omai Mine in Guyana, which produced gold from 1994-2005. Upon closure, milling facilities and part of staff were moved to IAMGOLD's Rosebel operation. Cambior also sold Omai Bauxite in 2006.
The Quimsacocha project in Ecuador, now known as Loma Larga. Divested in 2012 to INV Metals, of which IAMGOLD still holds shares.
The Mupane gold mine in Botswana (divested in 2011 to Galane Gold), of which IAMGOLD sold its position in March 2016.
The Langlois gold mine in Quebec, now operated by Nyrstar NV.
The Sleeping Giant gold mine (known in French as Mine Géant Dormant) in Quebec.
The Carlota copper project in Arizona.
La Arena, a Peruvian development copper / gold project, to Rio Alto Mining Limited in 2008 (Rio Alto).[6]

Recent history[edit]
Stephen Letwin was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Iamgold on November 1, 2010. Letwin held executive positions at Enbridge Inc., TransCanada Energy and TransCanada Pipelines prior to joining Iamgold. He is a certified general accountant and a member of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario. He holds an MBA from the University of Windsor and is a graduate of the Harvard Advanced Management Program.[7]
The company announced on January 23, 2013, that it is reducing exploration activity in Mali as a result of events in this country. This is not expected to impact production at the two mines in Mali where the company holdes an operating interest.[8]
In December 2016 IAMGOLD announced it would acquire junior mining company Merrex Gold.[9] Merrex's primary assets were gold properties in West Mali, Guinea and Nova Scotia.
In June 2017 IAMGOLD closed a transaction with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., a Japanese based mining company, to develop the Côté Gold Project in Ontario. Sumitomo purchased a 30% stake in Côté in exchange for a $195 million investment. [10]

Operations[edit]
IAMGOLD has an annual production of approximately 800,000 ounces of gold from operations in North America, South America, and West Africa.
In Q1 2017 IAMGOLD reported attributable gold production of 214,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $992 per ounce sold. For the quarter the Company posted a net loss of $18 million. [2]
Mines[edit]
The following mines provide attributable gold production to the company:

The Essakane gold mine, acquired by IAMGOLD from Orezone Resources in 2009, located in Burkina Faso. IAMGOLD holds a 90% interest, the remainder belonging to the government of Burkina Faso.[3]
The Rosebel gold mine, acquired by IAMGOLD through its merger with Cambior in 2006, located in Suriname. IAMGOLD holds a 95% interest, the remainder belonging to the government of Suriname.
The Westwood gold mine in Abitibi, Quebec, located in the Canadian province of Quebec. IAMGOLD holds a 100% interest through its Doyon Division subsidiary.
The Sadiola gold mine in Mali, operated by joint-venture partner AngloGold Ashanti. IAMGOLD holds a 41% working interest.
The Yatela Mine gold mine in western Mali, about 25 kilometres north of the Sadiola Mine on an adjoining mining permit and now being put into closure. IAMGOLD holds a 41% interest.

2016 Exploration and Development Projects[edit]
The Company is exploring and progressing feasibility studies on a number of options. Projects of note include, but are not limited to:

The Boto Gold project in Senegal
The Côté Gold project in Northeastern Ontario
The Pitangui project in Minas Gerais, Brazil
The Diakha project in Mali. The project is a joint venture with Merrex Gold.
The Eastern Borosi project in Nicaragua. The project is a joint venture with Calibre Mining.
The Monster Lake project in Quebec. The project is a joint venture with TomaGold.
The Camp Caiman project in French Guiana, currently on hold.

At the end of 2014, IAMGOLD held an 86% interest in Euro Ressources, a French corporation, which in turn held a royalty on IAMGOLD's Rosebel mine, and 14% of Colombus Gold's outstanding shares. Colombus Gold is focused on the development of the Montagne d'Or Gold Deposit, located on the Paul Isnard concession in French Guiana, which hosts an NI43-101 in-pit gold resource of 3.9 million ounces at approximately 1.5 g/t.
In January 2017 IAMGOLD released a positive preliminary economic assessment for the Côté Gold project that outlined a 21-year mine life producing an average of 302,000 ounces of gold annually at average total cash costs of $564/oz and all-in sustaining costs of $686/oz.[4]
In June 2017 IAMGOLD released a positive Pre-Feasibility Study for its Côté Gold Project in Northern Ontario that outlined proven and probable gold reserves of 5.9 million ounces. The study estimated a 17-year mine life producing an average of 320,000 ounces of gold annually.[5]
Past Mines (Divested and Closed)[edit]
IAMGOLD and its predecessor companies have existed since 1986. Notable divested and closed mines from IAMGOLD and its predecessor companies include:

The Niobec underground mine near Chicoutimi in the Canadian province of Quebec. This mine is North America's only source of pyrochlore, the primary niobium ore, and one of only three major producers of niobium. Sold to Magris Resources on Jan 22nd 2015.
The Mouska gold mine in Abitibi, Quebec, closed in 2014.
The Doyon gold mine, an open-pit and underground operation in Abitibi, Quebec, closed in 2008. The mill has since been refurbished and upgraded to handle the Westwood mine's ore, while treated material is disposed of in the old Doyon open pit.
Stakes in the Tarkwa Mine and Damang Mine in Ghana (divested in 2011).
The Omai Mine in Guyana, which produced gold from 1994-2005. Upon closure, milling facilities and part of staff were moved to IAMGOLD's Rosebel operation. Cambior also sold Omai Bauxite in 2006.
The Quimsacocha project in Ecuador, now known as Loma Larga. Divested in 2012 to INV Metals, of which IAMGOLD still holds shares.
The Mupane gold mine in Botswana (divested in 2011 to Galane Gold), of which IAMGOLD sold its position in March 2016.
The Langlois gold mine in Quebec, now operated by Nyrstar NV.
The Sleeping Giant gold mine (known in French as Mine Géant Dormant) in Quebec.
The Carlota copper project in Arizona.
La Arena, a Peruvian development copper / gold project, to Rio Alto Mining Limited in 2008 (Rio Alto).[6]

Recent history[edit]
Stephen Letwin was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Iamgold on November 1, 2010. Letwin held executive positions at Enbridge Inc., TransCanada Energy and TransCanada Pipelines prior to joining Iamgold. He is a certified general accountant and a member of the Certified General Accountants of Ontario. He holds an MBA from the University of Windsor and is a graduate of the Harvard Advanced Management Program.[7]
The company announced on January 23, 2013, that it is reducing exploration activity in Mali as a result of events in this country. This is not expected to impact production at the two mines in Mali where the company holdes an operating interest.[8]
In December 2016 IAMGOLD announced it would acquire junior mining company Merrex Gold.[9] Merrex's primary assets were gold properties in West Mali, Guinea and Nova Scotia.
In June 2017 IAMGOLD closed a transaction with Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., a Japanese based mining company, to develop the Côté Gold Project in Ontario. Sumitomo purchased a 30% stake in Côté in exchange for a $195 million investment. [10]
