Total Return at Market Price since inception includes a 4.5% commission paid at the fund's initial public offering. Fund performance changes over time and current performance may be lower or higher than what is stated. Investment return, price, yields, and NAV will fluctuate.   The fund is a closed-end fund. Unlike open-end funds, closed-end funds are not continually offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market. Consequently, shares of closed-end funds may trade at, above or below their net asset values (“NAV”). If a closed-end fund’s shares trade at a price below their NAV, they are said to be trading at a “discount.” Conversely, if a closed-end fund's shares trade at a price above their NAV, they are said to be trading at a “premium.” Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount.   Common Shares are only available for purchase and sale on the New York Stock Exchange at the current market price. Common Shares may trade at a discount to NAV.   The fund has Common Shares and Preferred Shares. The Pricing, Yield, Dividends, Fund History, Total Return and Premium/Discount of Market Price to NAV information provided herein relates to Common Shares only. Unlike Preferred Shares, Common Shares are not rated.   The fund's issuance of Preferred Shares creates leverage risks for holders of Common Shares. Two major types of risks created by leverage include: (1) the likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of Common Shares, because changes in the value of the fund's portfolio securities are borne entirely by holders of Common Shares; and (2) the possibility either that income available for Common Share dividends will fall if the Preferred Shares dividend rate rises, or that income available for Common Shares dividends will fluctuate because the Preferred Shares dividend rate varies.   The fund may invest up to 20% of its assets in non-investment grade securities that generally entail greater market, credit and liquidity risks than investment grade securities.   Income may be subject to state and local taxes.   These pages include general information and have not been tailored for any specific recipient or recipients.

Credit quality pertains only to the securities in the fund's portfolio and does not protect fund shares against market risk.

Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund Commences Tender Offer For Common Shares









PR Newswire




Jul 14, 2017 4:15 PM EDT













 




























































  PITTSBURGH, July 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Federated Premier Intermediate Municipal Income Fund (NYSE: FPT) announced today that it commenced a tender offer for up to 20 percent of its outstanding common shares.  The fund's tender offer will expire on Aug. 11, 2017, at 5 p.m. EDT. The fund is offering to purchase its outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of its net asset value per share in U.S. dollars as determined as of the end of regular trading on the NYSE on Aug. 11, 2017.  As described in the tender offer materials, if more than 20 percent of the fund's outstanding common shares are duly tendered (and not withdrawn) prior to the expiration date, the fund will repurchase 20 percent of its outstanding common shares on a pro rata basis (with appropriate adjustment to avoid purchase of fractional common shares) upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer.  Accordingly, there is no assurance that the fund will purchase all of a common shareholder's tendered common shares.  Additional terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the fund's tender offer materials, which are being distributed to common shareholders.  There can be no assurance such terms and conditions will be satisfied. In addition, under certain circumstances, the fund may terminate or abandon the tender offer, as described in the tender offer materials, and there can be no assurance such circumstances will not arise. The Board of Trustees of the fund, upon recommendation of the fund's investment advisor, Federated Investment Management Company, approved the tender offer.  The tender offer was considered as part of the Board's ongoing review of available options to enhance value for the fund's common shareholders, to address the discount at which the fund's common shares have traded and to provide liquidity.
