			Dr. Clydesdale has had a distinguished career as a university professor and administrator, scientific researcher and advisor to public and private agencies both in the U.S. and around the world in research, product development and scientific policy and regulation to optimize food quality, food acceptability, food safety, nutrition and overall health and quality of life. Dr. Clydesdale's honors and accomplishments in the field of food science and nutrition are legion and too numerous to mention. Dr. Clydesdale is currently Distinguished University Professor, Department of Food Science, College of Natural Sciences, University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Director of the University of Massachusetts Food Science Policy Alliance, which he founded in 2004. From 1990 to 2008, he was head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst Department of Food Science, which at the time of his retirement was ranked nationally among the top three university food science departments in research and the top department in the university in student satisfaction.





In 2010, the National Research Council of the National Academies, based on the performance of the Department in the last year of Dr. Clydesdale's tenure as its Head, ranked the Department as number one among all Food Science Departments in the United States for PhD research and education. Since his election as a Fellow of the American Institute of Nutrition, he is a fellow of the four premier societies in the field of food science and nutrition. Dr. Clydesdale is the editor of Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition, the top ranked journal in food science with a worldwide audience. He has published some 375 scientific articles and coauthored or edited 20 books, including Food Colorimetry: Theory and Applications (1975), which is still considered a leading authority in its field. In addition, Dr. Clydesdale has done extensive work related to the science and technology of formulating and measuring natural and synthetic colors in foods and emulsions and the sensory effects, benefits and interactions of food and beverage colorants and flavors. Dr. Clydesdale initiated and organized the University of Massachusetts Food Science Strategic Research Alliance, which has approximately 25 member companies including many of the major multinationals. He also chaired the Strategic Research Alliance from 1988 to 2008, along with the Strategic Policy Alliance from its inception in 2004. Dr. Clydesdale helped in the formation of a venture company (Wesfolk) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst to commercialize the scientific discoveries being made by his department. Dr. Clydesdale also has served on numerous standing and special committees of the FDA and the National Academy of Sciences focusing on food and ingredient safety, nutrition, policy and labeling (e.g., he chaired the FDA working panel that evaluated Olestra, the last food additive to gain approval, and in 2009-2010 served on an FDA committee which evaluated FDA's Research Mission), including three terms as chair of the Food Forum of the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy. In 2010, he was reappointed to another three-year term on the National Academies, Institute of Medicine, Food and Nutrition Board. Dr. Clydesdale served as Chair and currently serves on the Board of Trustees of the American branch of the International Life Sciences Institute. He has served on the board of the Global International Life Sciences Institute. Each of these entities promotes scientific research to optimize food safety and health globally. He has been active worldwide speaking on the challenges and opportunities of using technology to improve food safety, nutrition and health while increasing the global food supply.

 



For the following reasons, the Board concluded that Dr. Clydesdale should serve as a director of Sensient, in light of its business and structure, at the time it files this proxy statement. Dr. Clydesdale is a globally-k

Item Description: Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Netherlands, 1985. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****.Dramatic cultural changes have occurred in the areas of food, nutri- tion, and health in the United States. Today, the clarion call is for fitness with trim-muscular in and skinny-pale out. The me generation has turned into a robust health seeking we generation, with emphasis on group participation in an ever-increasing array of health clubs. Com- bined with this renewed interest in fitness is an increasing acceptance of technology, which has resulted in the expectation of a high quality of life through the use of technology rather than through its banishment as was the case in the late 1960s and 1970s. Thus, we see the use of indi- vidualized computer programs for diet, exercise, and improvement of athletic performance through motion analysis of the event. Aging has become an accepted phenomenon and the long fruitless search for perpetual youth seems over. Old is beautiful as long as it is associated with the trim and robust look of other age groups. This is due to the changing demographics of the United States, as well as recogni- tion of the simple fact that age is not a drawback in achievement levels in most areas of our society.These changes, which are in many respects the antithesis of the beliefs of the 1970s have led us to write this book. We are going to attempt to use the same style of communication we used in our previous book, Food, Nutrition, and You but the focus and content is quite different. Softcover reprint of the original 1st ed. 1985.  Bookseller Inventory # AAV9780870555077

DetailsResearch
	The premise of our research is that policy must be based on science not on what makes one feel good or pleases social media. In this way food can be safe, nutritious , convenient and available at reasonable cost for everyone not just those who can afford  elite stores,

	It is involved with establishing scientifically based interpretations of national and international food regulations and policy to increase the confidence of the public in the food supply and establish guidelines which can easily be understood and evaluated.  In addition, our research interests cover a wide spectrum of technological innovations to optimize physiological, functional, sensory and bioactive properties of food.

Teaching
	Food Science 590A Food Science Policy
	This course is taught by guest lecturers who represent the top regulatory and policy leaders in Industry , Government and Academia including the former Head of FDA.
	Students are able to  interact with these leaders and develop a network that is virtually impossible to establish any other way

Synopsis




In the U.S., before any additive is added to a food product the manufacturer must submit it to the FDA for approval and prove that its use has a reasonable certainty of not causing harm. The Priority-Based Assessment of Food Additives (PAFA) Database, compiled and maintained by the U.S. FDA/CFSAN (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition), is a team resource for evaluating the status of all food additives. Food Additives: Toxicology, Regulation, and Properties contains a wealth of facts regarding the chemical and toxicological effects of direct food additives. It consists of identifying/administrative information for nearly 2,000 compounds that are, could be, or have been added to the U.S. food supply. Limited information is also provided for an additional 1,000 compounds. Part 1, Administrative and Chemical Information, includes data such as the CAS registry number, name of the compound, other identifying numbers, exposure to the population, and much more. The toxicological data fields are divided into three main sections: Genetic Toxicity and Cytotoxicity Information, Acute Toxicology Information, and Oral Toxicology Information. These sections contain data from toxicological studies.

About this book




Dramatic cultural changes have occurred in the areas of food, nutri­ tion, and health in the United States. Today, the clarion call is for fitness with "trim-muscular" in and "skinny-pale" out. The "me generation" has turned into a robust health seeking "we generation," with emphasis on group participation in an ever-increasing array of health clubs. Com­ bined with this renewed interest in fitness is an increasing acceptance of technology, which has resulted in the expectation of a high quality of life through the use of technology rather than through its banishment as was the case in the late 1960s and 1970s. Thus, we see the use of indi­ vidualized computer programs for diet, exercise, and improvement of athletic performance through motion analysis of the event. Aging has become an accepted phenomenon and the long fruitless search for perpetual youth seems over. Old is beautiful as long as it is associated with the trim and robust look of other age groups. This is due to the changing demographics of the United States, as well as recogni­ tion of the simple fact that age is not a drawback in achievement levels in most areas of our society. These changes, which are in many respects the antithesis of the beliefs of the 1970s have led us to write this book. We are going to attempt to use the same style of communication we used in our previous book, "Food, Nutrition, and You" but the focus and content is quite different.
