Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

We're Here When You're Hurt

Car accidents, truck accidents and other incidents can leave injured parties unable to work and facing a mountain of bills. If you are injured due to someone else's negligence, it makes sense that the at-fault party's insurance company compensates you for lost wages, medical bills and other damages. Unfortunately, it's rarely as easy as submitting a claim and getting reimbursed.Insurance companies are skilled at protecting their profits by minimizing claims from injured individuals or denying legitimate claims completely. At Healy Scanlon Law Firm in Chicago, we represent injured clients in a wide range of personal injury lawsuits.







Equipped To Handle Complex Cases
We have the resources, the experience and the knowledge necessary to prevail in complex and contested personal injury matters.
If an accident has left you or a family member seriously injured — perhaps even permanently injured — your well-being and the financial security of your family may depend on the settlement or verdict that your attorney obtains for you. It is no time to rely on an inexperienced or unproven law firm.

Swimming pool accident









We Resolve Cases Both In And Out Of Court
Many of our most successful cases involve catastrophic injuries and contested liability. It gives us great satisfaction to come through for our clients when the odds are stacked against them. Our success comes from hard work and our commitment to each client.
Often, we are able to reach agreement without the need to litigate. However, if a fair offer is not on the table, our lawyers are always prepared to go to trial to recover the full amount our clients deserve. We have successfully tried cases in courts throughout Illinois, including the Illinois Supreme Court.
We Only Collect If You Do
There is never a charge to discuss your case with one of our attorneys. We accept cases on a contingency fee basis, which means we only get paid if we recover a settlement or verdict for you. Evening and weekend consultations are available. To speak to us, call 312-324-0409 or send us an 
					email.

The severity of injuries and aggressive legal defense make for complex cases. We have a record of success.

Individual preferences for funeral plans and interment vary widely, so funeral directors work closely with families to plan a customized religious service, memorial, wake or other tribute to honor the deceased. These arrangements also provide an opportunity for surviving family and friends to gather to pay their respects, reminisce and grieve.Learn about:Funeral Home ServicesHow to Pay for a FuneralFuneral CostsTo find a funeral home near you, search the AgingCare.com Funeral Home Directory. A representative will assist your family with making funeral arrangements. This service is provided free of charge.Find Care In Your AreaEnter a location Select a categoryIn-Home CareAssisted LivingIndependent LivingMemory CareNursing HomesAdult Day CareElder Law AttorneysFuneral HomesGeriatric Care ManagersHospiceCemeteriesFuneral Home ServicesIn addition to arranging the funeral itself, providers also sell burial and cremation goods, complete and file a great deal of paperwork, and tend to other aspects of the process. Funeral directors typically strive to personalize arrangements so that they are in accordance with the decedent’s wishes and those of their family. If a funeral home does not directly provide certain requested services, the director should be able to coordinate them with another provider or give you a referral.The list below details the various services that funeral homes typically provide.Preplanned arrangementsPrepaid arrangementsTransportation of the decedent to and from the funeral homePersonalized assistance with planning religious, military, non-denominational, or fraternal services or a celebration of life.Paperwork (certificates of death, permits and other authorizations)Obituary compositionCremation servicesCommunication with clergy, officiants, musicians, and other funeral participantsAssistance with VA burial benefits and paperworkEmbalming, casketing and other preparationsFuneral song selectionInterment goods (urns, caskets, headstones, plaques and other monuments)Assistance with selection of interment location (cemetery, mausoleum, cremation garden, etc.)Memorial products (prayer cards, tribute DVDs, a register book, etc.)Professional coordination and direction of all servicesGet a Funeral Planning Checklist to make sure all aspects of a service or memorial are covered.How to Pay for a FuneralEnd-of-life arrangements can get pricy very quickly, depending on the goods and services that a family selects. These things are out-of-pocket expenses that are paid by the decedent or their surviving family members, but some financial assistance may be available for eligible veterans and/or individuals who had low income. The list below provides a few different ways of funding funeral arrangements as well as programs that can help defray costs.Cash, Check or CreditVA Burial Benefits and AllowancesLife Insurance Policy Death BenefitsPrepaid Revocable or Irrevocable TrustsFuneral LoansSSA Death BenefitsThe Deceased’s EstateBurial Insurance“Payable on Death” Accounts or Totten TrustsFuneral Costs Near YouCosts vary according to the type of memorial service and interment desired, any products selected or required for burial or cremation, and the geographic location where services and interment take place.According to the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA), the average cost of a funeral and burial for an adult was $7,181 in 2014. This total includes a basic services fee, transfer of remains, embalming, casketing, cosmetology, dressing, grooming, a metal casket, use of facilities and staff for viewing and a funeral ceremony, use of a hearse, use of a service car/van, and a basic memorial package of memorial cards, register book, etc. With the addition of a vault, which most cemeteries require, the average cost increases to $8,508. Keep in mind that this number does not account for things like cemetery fees, the cost for a monument or marker, flowers or an obituary.The NFDA estimates the average cost of a funeral and cremation in 2014 was $6,078. This includes the same services listed above as well as a cremation fee, cremation casket and urn. However, this cost does not include charges for a vault, niche, or cemetery monument or marker.Find Care In Your AreaEnter a location Select a categoryIn-Home CareAssisted LivingIndependent LivingMemory CareNursing HomesAdult Day CareElder Law AttorneysFuneral HomesGeriatric Care ManagersHospiceCemeteriesPopular CitiesAstoria, NYBaltimore, MDBronx, NYBrooklyn, NYBuffalo, NYChicago, ILCincinnati, OHCleveland, OHDallas, TXDetroit, MIElmhurst, NYHouston, TXIndianapolis, INJackson Heights, NYJacksonville, FLLos Angeles, CALouisville, KYMilwaukee, WINew York, NYPhiladelphia, PAPittsburgh, PAQueens, NYQueens Village, NYRego Park, NYYonkers, NYSelect a StateAlabamaAlaskaArizonaArkansasCaliforniaColoradoConnecticutDelawareFloridaGeorgiaHawaiiIdahoIllinoisIndianaIowaKansasKentuckyLouisianaMaineMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMississippiMissouriMontanaNebraskaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNew MexicoNew YorkNorth CarolinaNorth DakotaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandSouth CarolinaSouth DakotaTennesseeTexasUtahVermontVirginiaWashingtonWest VirginiaWisconsinWyomingChoosing a Funeral HomeWhen selecting a funeral home to preplan your final arrangements or arrange services for a loved one who has passed, there are a few important things to keep in mind. You and your family should feel as comfortable as possible when making these difficult decisions. Below are some tips to use when making a selection.Know your rights.  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Funeral Rule grants consumers a number of rights when choosing a funeral provider. Brush up on these to make sure you do not get pressured into a purchase at such an emotional time.Set a budget. It is important to know what products and services are required and how much money you can afford to spend. If a loved one has passed, check to see if they had made prepaid arrangements or set aside money specifically for their final expenses. Shop around  It is your right to discern which provider you wish to use. Request goods and pricing information in the form of a General Pricing List (GPL) from multiple sources in order to make an informed decision. You can even choose to purchase an urn or casket from a wholesaler or other retailer and the funeral home must accept these supplies without charging you additional fees.Purchase only what you want. You do not have to accept expensive product and service packages that might include goods you do not want or need. You have a right to buy individual goods and services.To see the complete guide on how to select a funeral home, read "Funeral Planning Pointers."Featured ArticlesLearn more about making final arrangements in these articles written by elder care experts and experienced caregivers.How to Turn a Funeral into a True Celebration of Life5 Essential Differences between a Burial and a Cremation ServiceTake the Guesswork out of Funeral ArrangementsMember LoginxScreen name or email address  Password   Remember meForgot your password?The email address (or screen name) and password you entered don't match.Or  Sign in with Facebook Not yet a member?
