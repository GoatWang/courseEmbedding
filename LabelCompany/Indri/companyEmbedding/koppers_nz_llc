How are Koppers Products Used?
It all starts with coal.
Coal is carbonized to make coke and Koppers purchases a by-product of Coke-Coal tar. Koppers distills the coal tar and manufactures carbon materials and chemicals that are essential to the aluminum, steel, paint, plastic, wood-preserving, and carbon black industries.
The products from the coal tar distillation also increase the durability of products such as railroad ties and utility poles.
The chart below illustrates how Koppers manufactures materials from coal tar as well as the industries that rely on our products to manufacture other goods and services that are needed worldwide.

	Item 1.01




	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	Following the receipt of the consent of the holders of a
	majority of the outstanding principal amount of the outstanding 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes) of Koppers Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koppers Holdings Inc., in a previously announced tender offer and consent
	solicitation, on January 19, 2017, Koppers Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a Third Supplemental Indenture, dated as of January 19, 2017 (the Supplemental Indenture) to the Indenture, dated as of
	December 1, 2009 (as previously supplemented, the Indenture) governing the Senior Notes. The Supplemental Indenture amends the Indenture and the Senior Notes to, among other things, eliminate substantially all of the affirmative and
	restrictive covenants (other than, among other covenants, the covenant to pay interest and premium, if any, on, and principal of, the Senior Notes when due) and certain events of default and related provisions applicable to the Senior Notes. Except
	as amended by the Supplemental Indenture, all terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture and the Senior Notes remain in full force and effect.


	Although the Supplemental Indenture was effective upon execution, the amendments to the Indenture and the Senior Notes set forth in the Supplemental Indenture
	will become operative only upon the initial date of acceptance for purchase by Koppers Inc. of Senior Notes validly tendered in its previously announced tender offer. Accordingly, the terms of the Supplemental Indenture will be null and void, and
	the terms of the Indenture will continue in full force and effect without any modification by the Supplemental Indenture, if such acceptance for purchase does not occur.


	The foregoing is a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Supplemental Indenture and is not a complete discussion of the document. Accordingly,
	the foregoing is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Supplemental Indenture, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Current Report on Form

	8-K

	and hereby incorporated by reference.


	The terms and conditions of Koppers Inc.s previously announced tender offer and consent solicitation are described in an Offer to Purchase and
	Consent Solicitation Statement, dated January 5, 2017 (the Offer to Purchase) and a related Consent and Letter of Transmittal, which have been sent to holders of Senior Notes. Koppers Inc.s obligations to accept any Senior
	Notes tendered and to pay the applicable consideration for them are set forth solely in the Offer to Purchase and the related Consent and Letter of Transmittal. This Current Report on Form

	8-K

	is not an offer
	to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to sell, or a solicitation of consents with respect to any securities. Koppers Inc.s previously announced tender offer and consent solicitation are made only by, and pursuant to the terms of, the Offer
	to Purchase and the related Consent and Letter of Transmittal. Koppers Inc. is not making any recommendation in connection with its previously announced tender offer and consent solicitation. In addition, this Current Report on Form

	8-K

	does not constitute a notice of redemption of the Senior Notes under the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture.

	Koppers Inc. Announces Initial Results of Tender Offer and Consent




	Solicitation For Its




	7.875% Senior Notes due 2019




	PITTSBURGH, January




	 20, 2017

	 Koppers Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Koppers Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KOP), announced today
	the initial results for its previously announced tender offer and related consent solicitation commenced on January 5, 2017 for any and all of its 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019. An aggregate of $292,427,000 principal amount of Notes,
	representing approximately 97.5% of the Notes outstanding (the Tendered Notes), had been tendered as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 19, 2017. Accordingly, the requisite consents to approve the proposed amendments to
	the Indenture governing the Senior Notes have been obtained. The anticipated early settlement date of the tender offer and consent solicitation is January 25, 2017.


	Based on the successful consent solicitation, Koppers Inc. and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, have executed a supplemental indenture that
	will eliminate, effective as of the initial settlement date of the tender offer and consent solicitation, substantially all of the covenants and certain events of default and related provisions applicable to the Senior Notes.


	Koppers Inc. will make a cash payment of $1,017.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes, which includes a consent payment of $30.00 per $1,000
	principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest payment date on the Senior Notes up to, but not including, the initial settlement date, to the holders of Senior Notes who tendered prior to the Consent
	Date.


	The Tender Offer will expire at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on February 2, 2017, unless extended (such date and time, as the same may be
	extended, the Expiration Date), with final settlement expected to occur on the following business day after the Expiration Date.


	Remaining
	holders who validly tender their Senior Notes after the Consent Date and before the Expiration Date will be eligible to receive $987.90 per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the most recent interest
	payment date on the Senior Notes up to, but not including, the final settlement date. Any extension, termination or amendment of the Tender Offer will be followed as promptly as practicable by a public announcement thereof.

	consent solicitation at a redemption price of 101.313% of principal value, declining annually in ratable amounts until the redemption price is equivalent to the principal value on December 1, 2017. Koppers Inc. presently intends to redeem
	pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes any Senior Notes that remain outstanding following consummation of the tender offer at a redemption price equal to $1,013.13 per $1,000 principal amount of Senior Notes.


	The tender offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions described in the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement,
	including that Koppers Inc. shall have successfully completed one or more offerings of its debt securities with (x) terms acceptable to Koppers Inc. in its sole discretion, (y) net proceeds sufficient to pay the applicable consideration
	for the tendered Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and all fees and expenses related to the tender offer and the consent solicitation, and the redemption price (including accrued but unpaid interest interest) for any Senior Notes not
	validly tendered pursuant to the tender offer and (z) settlement occurring on or prior to the initial settlement date of the tender offer and consent solicitation.

	This news release is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to sell any Senior Notes or any other securities, and shall not constitute an
	offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities. The tender offer and consent solicitation is being made only by, and pursuant to, the offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement and related letter of transmittal and
	consent, copies of which have been delivered to all holders of Koppers Inc.s 7.875% Senior Notes due 2019, and under which Koppers Inc., subject to applicable law, may terminate, withdraw or amend the tender offer and consent solicitation. In
	addition, this news release does not constitute a notice of redemption of the Senior Notes under the optional redemption provisions of the indenture governing the Senior Notes. The tender offer and consent solicitation is not being made in any
	jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the tender offer and consent solicitation is required to be made by a
	licensed broker or dealer, it shall be deemed to be made on behalf of Koppers Inc. by the Dealer Manager and Solicitation Agent. None of Koppers Inc., the Dealer Manager and Solicitation Agent, the Information Agent or the Tender Agent makes any
	recommendation as to whether holders of Senior Notes should tender their Senior Notes pursuant to the tender offer or deliver consents pursuant to the consent solicitation.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches.

Structure[edit]
The corporation is divided into three business units: Carbon and Chemicals, Railroad Products and Services, and Performance Chemicals. The company specialises in manufacturing carbon chemicals from coal tar. The five main chemicals that are produced are coal pitch for steel and aluminum production, carbon black for rubber vulcanization, creosote for wood treatment, and naphthalene and phthalic anhydride for plastics and polyester. Kopper's coal tar pitches are essential to manufacturing carbon anodes for aluminum smelting. Koppers also has extensive operations making creosote treated wood products, especially railroad ties and switches. Utility poles, foundations, decking materials, and wooden panneling are also produced by the company.
History[edit]
In 1943, Koppers, at the US Government's behest, built a factory in Kobuta, Pennsylvania on the left bank of the Ohio River just downriver from Beaver, to manufacture styrene-butadiene monomer, a building block used to make a form of synthetic rubber for the World War II defense effort.
In 1951, at Port Arthur, Texas, the company built a plant to manufacture the chemical monomer ethylbenzene, using as raw materials ethylene from the nearby Gulf Oil refinery, and benzene, which was a byproduct of the company's coke ovens in Pennsylvania and which was shipped down to Texas by barge. The ethylbenzene produced there was then shipped by barge back up to the Kobuta plant where it was converted to styrene monomer, and then polymerized to make expandable polystyrene. In the early 1950s, the company purchased a license to manufacture polyethylene at its Port Arthur plant. These chemical operations later were the basis for forming a new corporate entity with Sinclair Oil Corporation to form the Sinclair-Koppers Company in 1965.
In 2001, the company had to close down a wood treatment plant in Oroville, California due to contamination of the 205 acre facility, and the surrounding area. Chemicals like PCP and chromium were found to have been leaked into the local drinking water supply.
Beazer hostile takeover[edit]
In early 1988 Beazer, a British conglomerate run by one of the foremost corporate raiders of the 1980s, successfully launched a hostile takeover of Koppers for $1.81 billion ($3.8 billion today). The sale was completed on June 17, 1988.[1] A smaller, more streamlined domestic business unit of Koppers was bought back by local management in the early 2000s, and although much simpler than the once sprawling chemical and aggregate conglomerate of the early-to-mid 20th century, Koppers has once again become successful at its core businesses. In 2006 the new Beazer-free independent Koppers again went public [2].
Current business interests[edit]
Koppers operates facilities in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, China, South Africa. The coal tar processor Cindu Chemicals in the Netherlands was acquired in 2010.[1] Koppers sources coal tar from around the world for further processing by distillation into carbon chemicals. Its Monessen, Pennsylvania coke ovens have a combined annual capacity of over 360,000 tons. The company further operates coke ovens in Tangshan, People's Republic of China, and has co-located facilities near the operations of major steel makers.
Products[edit]
One of Koppers' leading products is coal tar. Asphalt sealants containing coal tar have high levels of benzo(a)pyrene and other toxic chemicals known collectively as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs.[2]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
