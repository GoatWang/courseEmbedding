SMid Growth Strategy

Investment Team
Don Bisson, CFA, is the Portfolio Manager for the Century SMid Growth strategy. He is supported by Century’s equity analysts and traders.
The team conducts fundamental, bottom-up research analysis on existing and prospective holdings. The research analysts have dedicated GICS sector coverage. We believe that this dedicated focus leads to strong knowledge and experience, which we think enhances the SMid Growth investment process. Each equity analyst has deep experience researching companies. As a result, each of them has developed an extensive list of company and industry contacts, along with domain expertise, that we believe are valuable when researching companies. The team’s approach to company research is intensive, with the Portfolio Manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with 60-80 companies per year.
Investment Philosophy
The SMid Growth investment philosophy is based on the premise that capital will flow to sectors of the market where returns on invested capital (ROIC) are above average and/or rising. The investment team believes that the small and mid cap segments of the market are inefficient and provide opportunities to utilize fundamental, bottom-up research to identify superior growth companies and misvaluations. The SMid Growth investment approach is fundamental, bottom-up in nature.
Investment Universe
The SMid Growth market capitalization range is mostly between $800 million to $6 billion at purchase.
Fundamental Research
The SMid Growth strategy invests in 3 types of investment opportunities; 1) “Core Companies”, which exhibit a strong competitive advantage, above average margins and returns on capital, and above average earnings per share and sales growth, 2) “Underestimations”, where the opportunity set is large and/or expanding rapidly, earnings estimates and returns on capital are typically rising, and we believe the market has underestimated revenue and earnings potential for the company, and 3) “Overreactions” (or “Fallen Angels”), where a growth company has experienced a temporary setback, we believe the negative news associated with the company is fully discounted in the share price, and we are comfortable with the fundamental milestones we have created for tracking the recovery process for the company.  Buy decisions result from the company matching one of the three types of growth opportunities we emphasize.
Valuation
Valuation is an important part of the buy process with each company put through a rigorous, proprietary intrinsic valuation analysis. The investment team incorporates two proprietary methodologies to measure valuation: 1) a Discounted Cash Flow (or “EVA”) model and 2) a Dividend Discount Model (“DDM”). The “EVA” and “DDM” analysis are complemented by 3) a comparable company analysis and 4) a historical relative P/E valuation. To qualify for purchase, the portfolio manager targets at least a 20% discount to intrinsic valuation for established core growth, underestimated growth, and temporary overreaction growth companies.
Portfolio Construction
There are typically 50-65 holdings in the SMid Growth portfolio. The portfolio is flat in the sense that weightings for individual holdings usually represent about 2% of the portfolio, with the top 10 holdings typically accounting for roughly 23-25% of the total portfolio. The rationale is that with roughly a 2% weighting for each stock, all holdings are equally important. The Portfolio Manager typically diversifies holdings across sectors and monitors portfolio characteristics relative to the Russell 2500 Growth index; however, sector weightings may vary significantly from the index.
Sell Discipline
The Portfolio Manager utilizes a comprehensive sell discipline designed to control risk and limit the impact of a single stock on the performance of the entire portfolio. Each holding has a price target that’s generated by our valuation approach. The following may trigger a sale: 1) a permanent deterioration of fundamentals; 2) overvaluation and technical deterioration; 3) better opportunities are available; 4) a position size exceeds 5%; or 5) market capitalization rises above a targeted level.

Small Cap Value Strategy

Portfolio Manager
Jeff Kerrigan, CFA, is the Portfolio Manager for the Century Small Cap Value strategy. He is supported by Century’s equity analysts and traders.
The team conducts fundamental, bottom-up research analysis on existing and prospective holdings. The research analysts have dedicated GICS sector coverage. We believe that this dedicated focus leads to strong knowledge and experience, which we think enhances the Small Cap Value investment process. Each equity analyst has deep experience researching companies. As a result, each of them has developed an extensive list of company and industry contacts, along with domain expertise, that we believe are valuable when researching companies. The team’s approach to company research is intensive, with the Portfolio Manager and equity analysts each having a goal to meet with 60-80 companies per year.
Investment Philosophy
Century’s Small Cap Value investment philosophy has four primary tenets:

Small capitalization markets are inefficient. This provides an opportunity to utilize a fundamental research approach to identify superior companies trading at a discount to intrinsic value.
In the context of value investing, it is important to delineate between less innovative and more innovative sectors.
Focus on opportunities with the greatest upside potential, emphasizing a combination of both classic valuation and relative valuation/earnings power.
Neutralize relative benchmark risk to isolate stock selection as the primary source of alpha mitigating the difficulty of consistently predicting market, sector, and industry direction, while delivering high active share.

Investment Universe
The Small Cap Value market capitalization range is generally within the range of the Russell 2000 Value (R2000V) index (typically, $50 million to $5 billion).
Fundamental Research
The strategy’s fundamental research process includes both financial modeling and qualitative analysis. The model is designed to develop an understanding of a company’s operating dynamics: financials, margins and growth rates and perform various scenario and sensitivity analyses.
The strategy’s qualitative analysis is focused around researching the key drivers of the business. The Portfolio Manager analyzes the industry’s competitive landscape, speaks with company management and listens to past earnings calls. The company specific research is further complemented with a formal sector profile designed to focus on the key catalysts driving sector dynamics.
Valuation
The strategy’s primary valuation methodology is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. Once the DCF analysis is completed, the Portfolio Manager considers the output within the context of less innovative and more innovative sectors. In less innovative sectors, we compare a company’s intrinsic value to the current stock price. In more innovative sectors, we compare a company’s intrinsic value to street estimates and the deviation between the two.
Portfolio Construction
The Portfolio Manager constructs a portfolio typically consisting of 70-110 companies. Larger positions generally range from 1.5 – 4.0% and tend to exhibit high expected return potential and a positive contribution to risk. Smaller positions typically range from 0.3 – 1.5%. The risk and return profile can be higher or more moderate. If the return profile is high, the smaller position is generally based on the desired sector or industry exposure relative to the benchmark from a portfolio construction standpoint.
Sell Discipline
The Portfolio Manager utilizes a comprehensive and flexible sell discipline. The following may trigger a sale:

Company’s cumulative valuation and earnings upside potential approaches fair value
Better opportunities exist
Fundamental deterioration of the company
Market capitalization rises above a targeted range
Position size exceeds 5%

WELCOME TO CENTURY CITY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC
It's Not What You Earn that Matters; it's What You Preserve
Wealth and Worth are not synonymous. While wealth is measured in dollars, cents and possessions, we believe Worth is a measure of  something much more: values, ideals, even work ethics. At Century City Capital  Management (CCCM), a fund of hedge funds manager, we celebrate that distinction and apply our intellectual resources and financial acumen toward helping manage, preserve and enhance worth in its many forms: For all of our clients.

From wealth structuring to investment management, we  believe you'll find that our global perspective, unique team approach,  fiduciary platform and more than 25 years of combined experience not only distinguish us from others, but also provides for the kind of insights, solutions and expertise that have a worth all their own.

The question most institutional investors and others will ask is: Do Fund of Fund Managers Add Value? We believe that at the most general level, a fund of hedge funds manager should:

Understand all hedge fund strategies;
Understand all instruments used by hedge funds;
Emphasize qualitative aspects relative to quantitative variables;
Be in the "information loop" and have extensive proprietary data;
Have his/her interest aligned with those of his/her investors;
Be of the highest integrity

CCCM's value added is derived from these principals,  and its well-honed manager selection and risk management  processes, enhanced product engineering and asset allocation, combined  with top-down world views. CCCM offers a wide range of investment products that  seek to preserve capital while achieving solid investment returns.

Our Services

Developing a successful financial program requires an in depth understanding of your goals, risk tolerance and current and prospective situation. Depending on what services you choose, we will walk you through a step-by-step process that will help make you feel confident in your decisions. While we do offer exceptional financial planning and consulting services, asset management constitutes the majority of our on going work for clients.

We are dedicated to developing lasting relationships with all our clients. We believe in helping you assess your financial goals and participate in the management of your finances.
 
Once your goals have been established, we will customize a portfolio and appropriate strategies that meet your various needs and objectives. As appropriate we will incorporate investments in fixed income, ETFs, individual stocks, and sometimes, alternative assets, mutual funds, and option strategies.

If a financial program is warranted and desired, we may utilize the following additional products and services:

Tax management
Retirement strategies
Estate conservation
Trust strategies
Closely held business valuation, sale and/or transfer planning
Insurance and annuity products


One of the benefits of working with us is our ability to provide clear, easily understood explanations of financial products and services. The personalized program that we can provide is a roadmap to working toward a more secure financial future.
 
We’re looking forward to using our expertise to help you pursue your financial goals.
