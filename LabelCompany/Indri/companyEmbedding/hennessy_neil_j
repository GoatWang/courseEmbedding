Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry's top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron's/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed too volatile. A manager with average performance and volatility gets a score of zero. Superior managers get positive scores commensurate with the value they’ve added to a fund’s performance on an annualized basis. Value Line first scanned 1,008 equity funds, screening out those with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds were then organized by investment objective, and those with less than $200 million in assets were eliminated. 564 managers qualified to be ranked.




Unwavering commitment to our shareholders is a guiding principle at Hennessy Funds.  We strive to always deliver outstanding customer care, and we maintain a strong and dedicated Sales and Service team to serve our clients, shareholders and business partners.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

Hennessy, Neil J. - The Wall Street Transcript














































 





































Neil J. Hennessy
NEIL J. HENNESSY is the President and Portfolio Manager of Hennessy
Funds, Inc., and President, Chairman and CEO of Hennessy Advisors, Inc.
Today, he manages approximately $900 million in assets in five no-load
mutual funds.  Mr. Hennessy started his financial career over 24 years
ago as a stockbroker at Paine Webber after attending University of San
Diego and the Wharton School of Upper Management through the SIA.  In
1989, he opened his own broker/dealer firm, Edward J. Hennessy, Inc.  In
1996, he started Hennessy Funds, Inc., and was the first portfolio
manager to utilize the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ investment philosophy in a
mutual fund format, after successfully managing private clients’
accounts with the ‘Dogs’ for over five years.  Mr. Hennessy’s securities
industry experience is vast.  From 1987 to 1990, he served as a
nominated member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., District Business Conduct Committee (DBCC), and in March 1993, he
accepted the nomination to this committee again.  From January 1993 to
January 1995, Mr. Hennessy served his elected term as Chairman of the
DBCC.  His background reflects the spectrum of experience available in
this intricate business, from the competitive sales viewpoint to the
particular and involved compliance and supervisory standpoint.
Membership on the DBCC enabled him to review and deliberate cases
encompassing the following topics:  suitability, churning, stock
manipulation, misrepresentation, unauthorized transactions, conversion
of funds, forgery, fraud and many other aspects relevant to the
securities industry.  Mr. Hennessy implemented expert witness and
testimony as a pertinent area of his business.  He has heard
approximately 450 cases to date in which he has prepared, reviewed,
consulted and evaluated securities sensitive issues.  Several of these
cases have included court testimony, participation in arbitration and
grand jury testimony.

* Barron's has not published a "Top 100 Mutual Fund Managers" list since August, 2008.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry's top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron's/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed too volatile. A manager with average performance and volatility gets a score of zero. Superior managers get positive scores commensurate with the value they’ve added to a fund’s performance on an annualized basis. Value Line first scanned 1,008 equity funds, screening out those with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds were then organized by investment objective, and those with less than $200 million in assets were eliminated. 564 managers qualified to be ranked.

Morningstar Proprietary Ratings reflect risk-adjusted performance as of 6/30/2017. The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a  Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.The fund received 2 stars  for the three-year, 2 stars  for the five-year  and 3 stars for the ten-year  periods  ended 6/30/2017 among 368, 328 and  220 Mid-Cap Blend Funds, respectively.  Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations  in distribution percentage. Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar objectives.  The Morningstar Style Box reveals the fund's investment style as of 6/30/2017.   The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth).  ©Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

INVESTING WITH/Neil J. Hennessy; Hennessy Cornerstone Growth Fund

By CAROLE GOULDJUNE 2, 2002

NEIL J. HENNESSY, who runs the $310 million Hennessy Cornerstone Growth fund, relies on a computer model that, he says, gives his shareholders the consistency they crave.''Three years ago, the baby boomers were getting high returns on the money in their 401(k) plans,'' Mr. Hennessy said from his office in Novato, Calif. The bursting of the dot-com bubble shocked many investors, he said, adding, ''Now, they want money managers to use a more formula-based investing strategy.''To pick the fund's 50 stocks, Mr. Hennessy uses a formula and doesn't veer from it. The fund's quantitative approach, outlined in the fund's prospectus, cannot be changed without shareholder approval.The fund returned 22.8 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 5.2 percent for its group of funds that buy small growth stocks, and a 5.3 percent loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund gained 16.7 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 10.8 percent for its group and 13.5 percent for the S.& P. 500.

Mr. Hennessy, 46, is president of Hennessy Advisors, which acquired the fund's predecessor, O'Shaughnessy Cornerstone Growth, in June 2000. Hennessy Advisors manages an additional $50 million in three other mutual funds. Continue reading the main story

His computer model screens 9,700 United States companies with market capitalizations of more than $172 million. But small companies tend to meet the model's criteria more closely; the average market cap of the fund's companies is $950 million.The model identifies companies with price-to-sales multiples below 1.5. ''I'm not going to pay more than $1.50 for $1 of sales,'' Mr. Hennessy said. ''Our discipline helps us avoid situations like the dot-com blowup.''Over all, the price-to-sales ratio of the portfolio companies was 0.829 when the stocks were bought, compared with 1.64 for the benchmark Russell 2000 index.He uses the price-to-sales multiple instead of price to earnings, he said, because earnings are more subject to manipulation. ''You can fool around with earnings all day long,'' he said, ''but sales are a true number that gives an accurate picture of a company's growth.''

The computer model also favors companies with per-share earnings growth during the previous 12 months. The final screen looks for increasing stock prices over the last 3, 6 and 12 months.Mr. Hennessy reruns the computer screens once a year, sometime between October and February, replacing the laggard stocks with others that meet his criteria. He plans to keep shares until at least the next rebalancing, barring unusually high redemptions by investors or problems like misstated financial results by a company.He says he never visits companies, talks to companies' management or reads Wall Street analysts' research. But he spends considerable time, he said, talking to shareholders by phone, discussing the reasons behind the fund's investment strategy.In January, Mr. Hennessy added to the fund's holdings of the Tractor Supply Company, based in Nashville. Over all, he has paid an average of $42.13 a share; the stock now trades at $55.88.

The chain sells farm-related products as well as light truck equipment, work clothing and other merchandise. When he bought the shares in January, Tractor Supply's price-to-sales ratio was 0.38.ALSO in January, Mr. Hennessy added to his holdings of Lands' End, the direct marketer of traditionally styled casual clothing and luggage. At the time, the company s price-to-sales ratio was 0.93.He has paid $49.87 a share, on average, for the position; the stock closed on Friday at $61.93. Lands' End is being acquired by Sears, Roebuck in a deal that is expected to close in the middle of this month.He bought shares of NVR Inc., based in McLean, Va., in January 2001. NVR builds single-family homes as well as town houses and condominiums and offers mortgage-related services to its customers. He paid $213.73, on average, for the shares; they now trade at $331. The company's price-to-sales multiple in January was 0.59. Continue reading the main story
