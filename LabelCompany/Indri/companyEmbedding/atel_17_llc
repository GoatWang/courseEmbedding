Equipment Leasing Funds








ATEL 17's portfolio objective is to diversify by equipment type, industry, lessee, geographic location, and asset class. The Fund gives individual investors an opportunity to invest in the equipment leasing industry. The Fund's objective is to preserve and return invested capital, provide regular cash distributions through its operating period and additional cash distributions through liquidation. By investing in a portfolio of long-lived capital equipment, a significant portion of cash distributions may be tax deferred during the early years of operations, primarily from depreciation deductions. Additionally, the value of Fund equipment may provide investors with a hedge against inflation.

ATEL Securities Corporation Launches ATEL 17
ATEL 17, LLC, a $150 million public equipment leasing fund, was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 5. The fund closed escrow 20 business days later.
  ATEL 17 was formed to invest primarily in a diversified portfolio of equipment leased to major U.S. corporations who are considered “high-quality corporate credits,” including Wal-Mart, Cargill and General Electric.
  “We are proud to announce the release of ATEL 17 to the investment public,” comments Dean Cash, chairman and chief executive officer of ATEL Capital Group. “In the face of unpredictable economic conditions, diversification is essential to maintaining a healthy and well-balanced investment portfolio. ATEL 17 will offer our investors the opportunity to enhance the diversification of their investment portfolio while potentially reducing portfolio volatility.”





  ATEL 17 is ATEL Capital Group’s 24th syndicated program, including 15 prior public programs.
  The fund specializes in leasing primarily low-obsolescence, business-necessary equipment to the nation’s major corporations. It’s objective is to diversify by equipment type, industry, lessee, geographic location, and asset class.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
