Without actually seeing the vehicle, it's of course an estimate, but it will give you piece of mind as you're looking to get top dollar for the vehicle you're selling.Come directly to one of our many retail locations, and speak to a manager who will give you a fair and reasonable price for your car. Filling out the survey above will help you save some time at the dealership by filling out your vehicles information well in advance. We will still need to walk-around your car, but it will save time on all that paperwork we love!How Asbury appraisals are different:Thorough & Quick: Your appraisal can take as little as 20 minutes and you’re welcome to watch while you wait.There's no obligation: If your car is in reasonable shape, we'll appraise and purchase your car.Our specialists: They’re specially trained to evaluate the cars we buy.At Asbury, we use nationwide software that allows us sometimes to buy cars for more money since we work across multiple states and geographies.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

2905 Premiere PkwySte 300Duluth, GA 30097


        (770) 418-8200
    






Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.

if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help.

Contacted the headquarters for customer service regarding a dealership of theirs in Austin, TX and never received a call or email, nothing. Questionable why they even own auto dealerships.







This was my car after the Weston fire department put it out.  Total loss.  The car had been off for an hour and parked.  This is after I had Mercedes Benz of Tampa sell me and install a stage 2 turbo. They did all the work at Mercedes of Tampa and the car is now gone!!!!  They are holding to not being responsible for the vehicle.







I worked for a company that helps dealerships improve and these guys need it when it comes to customer service.  I called their corporate office to invite one of their employees to a conference.  Their receptionist was absolutely nasty to me.  She had a bad attitude when I asked to be transferred to someone else in the company.  He didn't work in that particular office and I had no idea where he would be as the company is rather expansive.  She asked what it was about and I was going to invite him to that conference which applied to his line of work.  She told me he would not be interested and hung up on me.  That's not for her to say.  I tried again the following day.  The receptionist still refused my offer until I asked her to give me the number for the dealership in the company this guy might be at.  She snapped that if I know the guy, I should have his number especially if I had business with him.  At this point, I had lost my cherub-like disposition.  She begrudgingly gave me the phone number and I thanked her, but she hung up on me without a word.  The number was incorrect.  Highly inappropriate.  Is this how Asbury Automotive's regular customers are treated?  Press "0" to be treated like the scum of the earth.







if you have an issue with one of their dealerships, don't bother calling Asbury who is their corporate office for help. I spoke to this lady in their customer compliant office and all she could do is stick up for the dealership. She was not absorbing one word of my situation and kept telling me that she would have a district guy Tam call me and he did not call me because he was in on the deal he made with my mother and I.  I went to Coggin Deland Hyundai in Deland, FL and at first treated so well and then the lies back fired on me, they made a deal with my mom that if i cosigned that they could get me into a car as well. We both left the dealership with cars they picked out for us and signed contracts. well two weeks later they tell me and my mom that moms car need new paperwork but say nothing that they were still looking for financing for my car.  Will, Joseph, Ramon, and Tam all lied to us and made us think that financing was not going to be an issue for me. it was not until 26 days goes by and i bring to their attention my old car was not paid off that they would not answer my calls and when they figured out my 30days was coming up, they called me to tell me that i needed to sign new paperwork, they did not mention anything else, i show up on the 30th day for them to tell me i wasn't approved for the car i fell in love with but could get me a new car just like my mothers for 50.00 more a month. I could not afford that.  So they brought my old car around and gave it back to me.  My friend also bought a car a few days after me and they waited until 30 days also and told her that they could finance her for 70.00 dollars more a month.  they already knew our budgets and went over them to begin with so to do a bate and switch on me was not right.  they knew the physical pain my old car was giving me and also knew i was planning on getting a new car in Feb that i was working on my credit and saving money to put down because i knew i was in bad shape and was upside down. No problem they told my mom and I, said they could get me into a car if i cosigned for my mother.  Anyways don't bother emailing or calling Asbury because they don't care about their customers.  Never got any response or phone call from any of them. I was promised 100.00 dollar referral fee and my late fee for my car payment and still have not seen a dime.  Just be careful when dealing with any dealership associated with Asbury Automotive Group.
