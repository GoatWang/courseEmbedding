ST. LOUIS, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:    ENR) today announced that the company has appointed Timothy W.

Mr. Gorman currently serves as Energizer's Vice President and Controller, Chief Accounting Officer and will assume responsibility for all financial-related functions. The company has retained Russell Reynolds Associates, a nationally recognized executive search firm, to identify a permanent CFO and will consider both internal and external candidates.

"I am excited to take on the interim CFO position," said Mr. Gorman. "Energizer is well-positioned and has produced strong financial results as evidenced by our recent second quarter earnings and increased fiscal year guidance. I look forward to working with senior management and the team to continue this momentum and execute on the strategic priorities that have created significant value for shareholders."
Mr. Hoskins continued, "On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, I want to thank Brian for his significant contributions to Energizer. Most notably, Brian played a key leadership role during the company's separation into two publicly-traded companies. We wish him the best in his future endeavors."
"I want to thank everyone at Energizer I have worked with over the last 10 years," said Mr. Hamm. "I have enjoyed serving as CFO and I am proud of the tremendous progress we have made in building a strong finance organization. I look forward to watching the company's continued success as I move into the next chapter of my career."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
