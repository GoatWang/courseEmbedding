History[edit]
Founded in 2004, Ambarella started with professional high definition H.264 video encoders for the broadcast market. In 2006, Ambarella applied this technology to consumer video cameras and later to the security IP camera market.
Ambarella has been a market leader[clarification needed] for video broadcasting, consumer video cameras and also security IP cameras, powering GoPro cameras with HD video (1080p)[3] and now Google wearables.[4]
The main driver for Ambarella's business is the security and surveillance market. IP security cameras constitute 45 percent of its business, and that segment is growing 25 percent year-over-year. Automotive after-market cameras (dash cameras) and flying cameras (cameras on UAVs) are other key growth markets for Ambarella's video chips.[5]
Products[edit]
Ambarella produces system-on-chip (SoC) video chips. In January 2015, it released its latest integrated SoC. Fermi Wang, President and CEO of Ambarella, explained, “The adoption of 4K Ultra HD video has been accelerating across consumer electronics markets,” said “The Ambarella H1 will enable a new generation of sports and flying cameras with high frame rate Ultra HD video, bringing professional-quality film making to the consumer.”[6]
Ambarella also produces an A12W ultra-low-power HD camera (SoC) which can encode a full HD video stream and a second HD stream for dual-lens cameras. It also features Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) for stable video recording during motion. The A12W supports long battery life requirements of wearable security cameras.[7]

History[edit]
Founded in 2004, Ambarella started with professional high definition H.264 video encoders for the broadcast market. In 2006, Ambarella applied this technology to consumer video cameras and later to the security IP camera market.
Ambarella has been a market leader[clarification needed] for video broadcasting, consumer video cameras and also security IP cameras, powering GoPro cameras with HD video (1080p)[3] and now Google wearables.[4]
The main driver for Ambarella's business is the security and surveillance market. IP security cameras constitute 45 percent of its business, and that segment is growing 25 percent year-over-year. Automotive after-market cameras (dash cameras) and flying cameras (cameras on UAVs) are other key growth markets for Ambarella's video chips.[5]
Products[edit]
Ambarella produces system-on-chip (SoC) video chips. In January 2015, it released its latest integrated SoC. Fermi Wang, President and CEO of Ambarella, explained, “The adoption of 4K Ultra HD video has been accelerating across consumer electronics markets,” said “The Ambarella H1 will enable a new generation of sports and flying cameras with high frame rate Ultra HD video, bringing professional-quality film making to the consumer.”[6]
Ambarella also produces an A12W ultra-low-power HD camera (SoC) which can encode a full HD video stream and a second HD stream for dual-lens cameras. It also features Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS) for stable video recording during motion. The A12W supports long battery life requirements of wearable security cameras.[7]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.

Ambarella drops after earnings include weaker-than-expected forecast
Ambarella Inc.  shares slipped more than 6% Tuesday afternoon following an earnings report that beat expectations but projected the current quarter's results lower than analysts expected. The company, which makes components for cameras and is a major supplier for GoPro Inc. , reported net income of $2.6 million, or 7 cents a share, on revenue of $64.1 million for its fiscal first quarter. After subtracting stock-based compensation and adjusting for other factors, Ambarella claimed profit of 39 cents a share. Analysts on average expected Ambarella to report adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share on sales of $63.5 million, according to FactSet. Ambarella's forecast for the current quarter calls for revenue of $69 million to $72 million and a sequential decline in gross margin, to a range of 62% to 63.5%, after an adjusted margin of 64.3% in the first quarter. Analysts on average expected revenue of $72.3 million, FactSet reported. Shares declined nearly 6% in immediate late trading following the report's release, dropped lower than $56.50 after closing with a 1.3% gain at $59.72.

Ambarella drops after earnings include weaker-than-expected forecast
Ambarella Inc.  shares slipped more than 6% Tuesday afternoon following an earnings report that beat expectations but projected the current quarter's results lower than analysts expected. The company, which makes components for cameras and is a major supplier for GoPro Inc. , reported net income of $2.6 million, or 7 cents a share, on revenue of $64.1 million for its fiscal first quarter. After subtracting stock-based compensation and adjusting for other factors, Ambarella claimed profit of 39 cents a share. Analysts on average expected Ambarella to report adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share on sales of $63.5 million, according to FactSet. Ambarella's forecast for the current quarter calls for revenue of $69 million to $72 million and a sequential decline in gross margin, to a range of 62% to 63.5%, after an adjusted margin of 64.3% in the first quarter. Analysts on average expected revenue of $72.3 million, FactSet reported. Shares declined nearly 6% in immediate late trading following the report's release, dropped lower than $56.50 after closing with a 1.3% gain at $59.72.

How Ambarella Inc Turns Its Patented Chips Into Gold
Find out how strong patents and pricing power set this chip supplier apart from the competition.

One of the key ways to find a winning investment is to seek out a company with pricing power. The ability to charge a premium price for one's products can lead to higher profit margins -- and in many cases, a higher stock price. Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) consistently delivers quarterly gross profit margins in the mid-60% range. Here's how the chip supplier does it.

Image source: Ambarella.
Approximately 72% of Ambarella's 658 employees are classified as research and development (R&D) personnel. These employees are essential to the creation of semiconductor systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) that the company uses to dominate the high-definition video processing marketplace. Customers utilize Ambarella's SoCs in various applications, including action cams, wearable body cameras, IP security, automobile dashboard cameras, and drones.
Ambarella's secret sauce
Ambarella chips are unique in that they have properties the competition has been unable to match. This allows the company to be a single-source supplier to its customers. Key features such as low power consumption or the ability to operate in low ambient light conditions give Ambarella products a price premium as well. Customers then turn these features into advantages for products they sell to end users and similarly charge a higher price for superior performance. 
Looking at Ambarella's patent activity is a clue to its success. Below is a table showing the number of patents granted to the company by year.

These patents create a moat around some of the exclusive designs that power the key advantages Ambarella products offer to customers.

Key features lead to higher gross margins
When we compare Ambarella to other semiconductor companies, its 66% non-GAAP gross margin stands out from the crowd -- yet another sign of the pricing power it can enjoy due to the irreplaceable nature of its technology.

Source: YCharts.
InvenSense has 632 employees, of which 311 are in R&D. It operates in more of a commodity-type business, thus having to compete on price to win design sockets in customer applications. As a result, InvenSense has a much lower gross margin for the products it sells. Although both companies are fabless semiconductor companies, one clearly provides a unique product that is more profitable than the other.
A company such as Ambarella forms deep ties with its customers, helping fulfill design needs for future products. Evidence of the partnering is reflected in comments from last quarter's earnings report stating that -- although not material of late -- Ambarella engages in margin-sharing arrangements with one or more of its customers predicated on the customer's product margin where the SoCs are used. In other words, Ambarella can get more money if its customer sells the final product to end users at a higher price. This may happen when the customer believes they can charge more for a product based on any competitive advantages offered by Ambarella's chips.  





Piling up the cash

Source: YCharts. 
From an investor's perspective, when we find a company with pricing power, it can be wise to invest and allow time to be your friend. Although Ambarella's stock price has been volatile at times, it continues to add cash to its balance sheet on a quarterly basis, and in the long-term may well wind up rewarding the patient investor.
All too often we tend to sell too early in a company's life cycle, failing to let the story play out. As long as Ambarella can outperform competitors with its chips, the company will continue to dominate its space, and that should mean more cash pouring onto the balance sheet. Just keep your eye on gross margins staying in the mid-60% range and watch for cash flows to remain strong.

What You Need to Watch When Ambarella Inc Reports Fiscal 2017 Earnings
The company is set to introduce a product in mid-2017 that may unshackle its stock from GoPro's misfortune.











                Frank DiPietro
            

                (CMFFrankDip)



            
            Feb 25, 2017 at 11:30AM
            
            





Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA) will report fiscal 2017 fourth quarter earnings after the market close on Feb. 28. As investors sift through the company results, there are two key updates from the management team that I will be watching most closely: the relationship with GoPro and new autonomous driving solutions.
First, here are the headline numbers from the company's guidance and the analyst estimates:


MetricCompany Guidance at MidpointAnalyst Consensus Estimate



Revenue
$85.5 million
$86.0 million


Earnings per share
$0.74
$0.75



Data source: Ambarella and S&P Capital IQ. Chart by author.
Anchored to GoPro's sinking ship
Ambarella has suffered due its ties to GoPro, the company's largest customer. Last fiscal year, it accounted for 30% of Ambarella's top line, and management projected that GoPro will account for 24% of revenue for fiscal year 2017.
All things being equal, if Ambarella can show consistent revenue growth each quarter while GoPro becomes a smaller and smaller portion of total revenue, investors will be less inclined to punish Ambarella every time the action cam maker issues downward guidance or misses analyst estimates.
Look out for any management guidance that shows reduced ties to GoPro in fiscal year 2018.
Plans for autonomous vehicles

Image source: Vislab.

In a recent article, I outlined Ambarella's $30 million acquisition of a private company in Italy called VisLab. That company consisted of 27 engineers who created an autonomous driving solution that was successfully navigated a vehicle from Italy to China. Last November, the Prime Minister of Italy met with VisLab and Ambarella representatives where he was able to experience firsthand some of their technology.
During the latest earnings call, Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang described the progress the company has made in the autonomous vehicle space:

Ambarella is continuing to invest heavily in computer vision development building upon the pioneering computer vision and autonomous vehicle work done by our combined Ambarella and the VisLab teams. We remain on track to ship out first computer vision chip in the beginning of next year.
And on Nov. 8, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi visited VisLab citing them as an example of a successful Italian start-up with a strong vision and solid execution. Mr. Renzi reached the facility in Parma on board VisLab's latest vehicle prototype driving in autonomous mode together with Alberto Broggi, Ambarella's Italian general manager. Mr. Renzi was impressed by the smoothness of the ride and commented positively on a vision that VisLab has developed in the past twenty years. 

At the Needham Conference in January, Wang also discussed company efforts around an SoC for the autonomous driving market and specifically, how it would compare to Mobileye's product. He indicated that VisLab had developed a complete software stack that would be used by Ambarella, and he did not want to give further guidance as the product had not yet been introduced. The offering will be Ambarella's first generation computer vision SoC called CV1 and is expected to be available in mid-2017. 
Ambarella initially entered the auto industry by providing SoCs to aftermarket dashboard camera manufacturers. More recent products have the company dealing directly with OEMs such as Gentex Corporation, which supplies the auto industry with products that are designed into new vehicles. Ambarella's latest automotive product is a multi-camera electronic mirror and surround view SoC which has passed automotive AEC-Q100 reliability testing.  





A Foolish lesson
It pays to listen to a company's earnings call as the discussion will often reveal important details that may not be reflected in the headline numbers. In the case of Ambarella, updates regarding its upcoming products for self-driving cars will be my No. 1 priority.
This could be a tremendous opportunity for the company and would help it reduce its association with GoPro, putting Ambarella itself in the driver's seat and giving investors a whole new perspective on the company's outlook for future growth.

Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167925799, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
