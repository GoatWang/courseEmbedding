"I can't say enough about BSP Filing Solutions. They are a fantastic supplier and have become our "go-to" partner in our filing supply business! We are FilingSupplies.com, a small E-Commerce business with about 22 suppliers but our # 1 choice is BSP Filing because of their unmatched customer service, willingness to partner with us on any size job, big or small and their 'can-do' attitude. I highly recommend BSP filing to any reseller in the filing supply space. You won't be disappointed!"
 


Shannon Oprea
Service Manager, FilingSupplies.com






 "BSP and Christy have been extremely responsive and great to work with on a number of custom projects as well as when I have a customer that needs to find a rare type of folder. I would recommend BSP to anyone. Their customer service is excellent and they deliver a solid product!"


Andrew Van Winkle
Business Manager, Lafayette Materials Management Co. (LAMMCO)
