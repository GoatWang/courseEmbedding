Equal Opportunity Employer
Lakeland Bank's policy requires that all candidates for employment complete an online application tied to a specific job opening.  Applications or resumes received via another method or in another format will not be considered unless an accommodation has been requested and approved.

Applicants with Disabilities
Lakeland Bank is committed to ensuring that our online application process provides an equal employment opportunity to all job seekers, including individuals with disabilities. If you believe you need a reasonable accommodation in order to search for a job opening or to submit an application, please contact us by calling 973-208-6235.  This is a dedicated line designed exclusively to assist disabled job seekers whose disability prevents them from being able to complete the application online.  Only messages left for this purpose will be considered.  A response to your request may take up to two business days.
Note:  Messages left for any other purposes such as non-disability related technical issues, or following up on an application, will not receive a response.

Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Statement
Lakeland Bank and its affiliates consider for employment, and hire qualified candidates. We are an equal opportunity employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, age, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, protected veteran or disability status or any other characteristic factor prohibited by law.  As such it is affirmed in policy and practice that the Bank will support and promote the concept of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action, in accordance with all applicable federal, state, provincial and municipal laws. The Bank also prohibits discrimination on other bases such as medical condition, marital status or any other factor that is irrelevant to the performance of our Team members. Candidates must possess authorization to work in the United States, as it is not the practice of the Bank to sponsor individuals for work visas.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
