truFreeze®




Stopping Disease Cold
The truFreeze System is CSA Medical’s latest advance in spray cryotherapy technology.  The device uses a patented technology to deliver extremely cold (-196° C) liquid nitrogen through a small catheter to produce touch-less flash freezing of a variety of tissue surfaces. During this process, cells are selectively destroyed while the underlying collagen tissue structure is preserved providing a scaffold for healthy tissue to re-grow.
The new truFreeze System was developed based on clinical user feedback and features a number of design enhancements over previous systems:
Control

Improved thermal and pressure control with less gas pressure in vivo
Integrated pressure sensing capabilities to allow real-time pressure monitoring for improved control and safety while passive venting
Two flow settings combined with active and passive venting options for increased procedure flexibility
Uniform, non-pulsing flow for a consistent, touch-free delivery of cryogen to the ablation site
New stainless steel reinforced catheter enables 180 degree retroflex allowing access to previously inaccessible ablation areas
Built-in active suction with high and low warnings

Convenience

60% smaller console footprint for a better fit in the gastroenterology suite or operating room
80% less set-up time with automated start-up diagnostics for faster preparation
Touch screen for fast, simple and intuitive operation
Automated pre-cooling for faster procedure times
Faster and simpler liquid nitrogen filling process

Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
