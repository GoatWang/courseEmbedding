Custom Films
AEP Industries Inc. began its business in 1970 in the small town of Lodi, NJ. We started by making polyethylene bags and with that, the Industrial Division was born. Today this division has grown to exceed production of over 400,000,000 pounds of product annually and commands the number one market share in the industry. We have changed our name to the "Custom Films Division" in order to more clearly define our business. Our extensive range of custom made products can be manufactured from 8" in width up to 40 feet and from .0006 to .010 thickness. So, whatever your packaging needs, AEP Custom Films Division offers a high quality product that fits the application.
Quality products and service is always a function of "people." From the very beginning we have selected dedicated and talented people who cooperatively pull together toward the attainment of our goals. Our remarkable growth is due to always remaining focused on how to better serve our customers in the packaging needs. We will continue to provide our customers with the quality, service and reliability they have come to expect from AEP over the years.

COMPANY NEWS

                    AEP INDUSTRIES TO CLOSE BRITISH MANUFACTURING PLANT                
AEP Industries Inc., the world's largest maker of plastic stretch packaging film, said it would close its plant in North Baddesley, England, resulting in the loss of 32 manufacturing jobs. The company, based in South Hackensack, N.J., will take a charge of $4.32 million for the closing, which will occur by mid-2001.











                    Company Briefs                
AEP INDUSTRIES Hackensack, N.J., said it would close its packaging plant in North Andover, Mass., which it acquired when it purchased Borden Inc.'s Global Packaging division on Oct. 11. About 360 employees will be laid off. SOTHEBY HOLDINGS INC., Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said a group including members of the Bass family of Fort Worth had received Federal approval to buy up to 15 percent of the company. INTEGRATED PROCESS EQUIPMENT CORP., San Jose, Calif., said it would lay off workers in product development and areas other than its main business of making chip polishing equipment.










COMPANY NEWS

                    AEP INDUSTRIES TO BUY BORDEN PACKAGING UNIT                
AEP Industries agreed yesterday to acquire Borden Inc.'s global packaging business for at least $360 million in cash and stock. The price will consist of $280 million in cash and at least $80 million in newly issued AEP common stock. In Nasdaq trading, AEP stock closed at $33.50, after falling to as low as $26.25 earlier in the day. Borden will get to name four of AEP's 10 directors; together with AEP, it will also get to name a fifth. But Borden has agreed not to increase its stake in AEP for at least three years after the transaction closes, which is expected to be in September. The acquisition will more than triple, to $900 million, the annual sales of AEP, which makes and sells polyethylene film products used for industrial and agricultural packaging.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!

MONTVALE, N.J., Nov. 5, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- AEP Industries Inc. (Nasdaq:   AEPI, the "Company" or "AEP") today announced John J. Powers, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing and a member of the Board of Directors, has been appointed to the newly created position of Chief Operating Officer ("COO") and has assumed the role of President, effective immediately.

"Throughout his 27 year tenure at AEP and most recently as a director of the Company, John has repeatedly proven that he is a high caliber leader and an important contributor to the company's success. His deep knowledge of AEP's business makes him an important contributor in driving growth and supporting the actions we are taking to achieve our long-range strategic plans," said Mr. Barba. "In recent years, we have been closely managing our operations and processes to become more efficient, and by appointing John as COO, we expect to bring additional focus to these critical areas to further optimize our capabilities across the organization and ensure AEP is best organized for success going forward."
The Company expects an orderly transfer of responsibilities for all of the Company's operating functions to Mr. Powers along with a reorganization of certain of the Company's sales and marketing activities.
Mr. Powers said, "It is a pleasure to continue on my path at AEP in this expanded new role. We remain focused on serving our present market with newer and better products and expanding our presence in these markets. I look forward to working collaboratively with the executive management team to continue to create value for our shareholders moving forward."
