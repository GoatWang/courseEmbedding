in Clearwire
Communications at the Closing (as defined therein) thereunder, the
occurrence of which is a condition precedent to the Parties
entering into this Agreement.


NOW THEREFORE,
for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree as
follows:


2. PURPOSE
AND SCOPE


2.1 Under this
Agreement, the Parties contemplate the good faith commitment by
Clearwire Communications to deploy the Clearwire Communications
Network in the United States and promote the use of Qualifying
Intel Devices, and Intel’s good faith commitment to develop,
market, sell, and support certain WiMAX Chipsets for use in Devices
that may be used on the Clearwire Communications
Network.


2.2 The
objective of the Parties is to jointly accelerate deployment and
adoption of WiMAX products and services in the United States across
a broad array of devices for use on the Clearwire Communications
Network, by the deployment of the Clearwire Communications Network
and, subject to applicable law, by providing incentives to OEMs and
ODMs to incorporate WiMAX Chipsets into Devices in commercial
quantities as soon as possible. To that end, Clearwire
Communications is making certain commitments to build out the
Clearwire Communications Network, and Intel is making certain
commitments to meet certain Embedding Rates. Intel and Clearwire
Communications also, among other things, are agreeing to certain
appropriate [*****] commitments, subject to applicable law, to
accelerate the deployment and adoption of WiMAX products and
services by OEMs and ODMs.


2.3 Both
Parties understand that their efforts to accelerate deployment and
adoption of WiMAX products and services are, among other things,
dependent on competitive pricing of WiMAX Chipsets and WiMAX
broadband Services that are sufficiently low to encourage OEMs and
ODMs to incorporate WiMAX Chipsets into a large segment of OEM and
ODM Device product lines and to encourage a large number of
potential Clearwire Communications Customers to use WiMAX broadband
Services on the Clearwire Communications Network.


3. TERM AND
MVNO OPTION


3.1 The term of
this Agreement will be from the date that this Agreement has been
executed by both Parties (“ Effective Date ”)
and for seven (7) years thereafter (the “ Initial
Term ”). After the Initial Term, but only for so long as
Intel (a) each year after the Initial Term continues to meet

Term, then
Intel may, at its sole option, extend this Agreement for successive
one (1) year terms (each an “ Intel Renewal
Period ”) up to a maximum of thirteen (13) times for
a total potential term of twenty (20) years by giving written
notice to Clearwire Communications of Intel’s election to
renew at least ninety (90) calendar days before the expiration
of the Initial Term or an Intel Renewal Period, as applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Intel has elected to extend this
Agreement for the maximum period set forth in the preceding
sentence, then beginning with the twentieth (20th) year, this
Agreement will automatically renew for successive one (1) year
renewal periods (each a “ Renewal Period ”),
provided however that at the beginning of the twentieth (20th) year
of this Agreement or no later than the first day of any subsequent
year, either Party my terminate this Agreement by giving written
notice to the other Party at least one (1) year prior to the
commencement of the next Renewal Period (for example only, if this
Agreement were extended by Intel through the twentieth (20th) year,
Clearwire Communications may terminate this Agreement effective at
the end of the twentieth (20th) year by giving written notice to
Intel no later than the first day of the twentieth (20th) year).
The Initial Term, together with any applicable Intel Renewal
Periods and any applicable Renewal Periods, is referred to as the
“ Term .”


3.2 3G MVNO
Option. Concurrent with the execution of this Agreement and subject
to the provisions of Section 3.3 below, the Parties
contemplate that Intel will enter into a separate written agreement
with a Sprint subsidiary pursuant to which Intel and the Sprint
subsidiary will agree upon the terms and conditions under which
Intel shall, if it so elects, have the right to become a Party (as
defined therein) to that certain MVNO Support Agreement dated as of
May 7, 2008, as amended, modified or supplemented from time to

3.3.2 If Intel
makes a 4G MVNO Election or a Combined MVNO Election in the first
three (3) years of this Agreement, then this Agreement shall
terminate three (3) years after the Effective Date. If Intel makes
a 4G MVNO Election or Combined MVNO Election more than three
(3) years after the Effective Date, but before the end of the
seventh year of this Agreement, then this Agreement shall terminate
at the time such 4G MVNO Election or Combined MVNO Election becomes
effective. In either case, if Intel exercises either a 4G MVNO
Election or a Combined MVNO Election, it will do so in good faith
by making commercially reasonable efforts to (a) develop,
promote, and sell a WiMAX mobile broadband service, and
(b) make available WiMAX chipsets to OEMs for, and work with
such OEMs to accomplish, the embedding of WiMAX Chipsets in Intel

Communications will provide to Intel copies of amendments, if any,
to the 3G MVNO Agreement and 4G MVNO Agreements.


3.5
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in
the 4G MVNO Agreement between the Parties, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the 3G MVNO Agreement between Intel and
a Sprint subsidiary, if Intel is in material breach of this
Agreement and/or in material breach of any 4G MVNO Agreement
between the Parties, or is in material breach of any 3G MVNO
Agreement between Intel and a Sprint Subsidiary, and has not cured
such material breach as provided for in this Agreement for breaches
related to this Agreement or any such 4G MVNO Agreement for
breaches related to such 4G MVNO Agreement or any such 3G MVNO
Agreement, then Clearwire Communications may terminate this
Agreement and the 4G MVNO Agreement (solely with respect to Intel
and not as to any other party to such agreements) between the
Parties by giving written notice of termination to
Intel.
