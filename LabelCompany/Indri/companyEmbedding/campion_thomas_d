Life[edit]
Campion was born in London, the son of John Campion, a clerk of the Court of Chancery, and Lucy (née Searle – daughter of Laurence Searle, one of the queen's serjeants-at-arms). Upon the death of Campion's father in 1576, his mother married Augustine Steward, dying soon afterwards. His stepfather assumed charge of the boy and sent him, in 1581, to study at Peterhouse, Cambridge as a "gentleman pensioner"; he left the university after four years without taking a degree.[1][2] He later entered Gray's Inn to study law in 1586. However, he left in 1595 without having been called to the bar.
On 10 February 1605, he received his medical degree from the University of Caen.[3]
Campion is thought to have lived in London, practising as a physician, until his death in March 1620 – possibly of the plague.[4] He was apparently unmarried and had no children. He was buried the same day at St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street.[1]
He was implicated in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, but was eventually exonerated, as it was found that he had unwittingly delivered the bribe that had procured Overbury's death.[5]
Poetry and songs[edit]




A Book of Ayres, 1601, with words by Campion and music by Philip Rosseter


The body of his works is considerable, the earliest known being a group of five anonymous poems included in the "Songs of Divers Noblemen and Gentlemen," appended to Newman's edition of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella, which appeared in 1591. In 1595, Poemata, a collection of Latin panegyrics, elegies and epigrams was published, winning him a considerable reputation. This was followed, in 1601, by a songbook, A Booke of Ayres, with words by himself and music composed by himself and Philip Rosseter. The following year he published his Observations in the Art of English Poesie, "against the vulgar and unartificial custom of riming," in favour of rhymeless verse on the model of classical quantitative verse. Campion's theories on poetry were criticized by Samuel Daniel in "Defence of Rhyme" (1603).[1]
In 1607, he wrote and published a masque[6] for the occasion of the marriage of Lord Hayes, and, in 1613, issued a volume of Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry, set to music by John Cooper (also known as Coperario). The same year he wrote and arranged three masques: The Lords' Masque for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth; an entertainment for the amusement of Queen Anne at Caversham House; and a third for the marriage of the Earl of Somerset to the infamous Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. If, moreover, as appears quite likely, his Two Bookes of Ayres[7] (both words and music written by himself) belongs also to this year, it was indeed his annus mirabilis.[1]
In 1615, he published a book on counterpoint, A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counterpoint By a Most Familiar and Infallible Rule,[8] a technical treatise which was for many years the standard textbook on the subject. It was included, with annotations by Christopher Sympson, in Playford's Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick, and two editions appear to have been published by 1660.[1][9]
Some time in or after 1617 appeared his Third and Fourth Booke of Ayres.[10] In 1618 appeared the airs that were sung and played at Brougham Castle on the occasion of the King's entertainment there, the music by George Mason and John Earsden, while the words were almost certainly by Campion. In 1619, he published his Epigrammatum Libri II. Umbra Elegiarum liber unus, a reprint of his 1595 collection with considerable omissions, additions (in the form of another book of epigrams) and corrections.[1]
Legacy[edit]
Campion made a nuncupative will on 1 March 1619/20 before 'divers credible witnesses': a memorandum was made that he did 'not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more', and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.[11]
While Campion had attained a considerable reputation in his own day, in the years that followed his death his works sank into complete oblivion. No doubt this was due to the nature of the media in which he mainly worked, the masque and the song-book. The masque was an amusement at any time too costly to be popular, and during the commonwealth period it was practically extinguished. The vogue of the song-books was even more ephemeral, and, as in the case of the masque, the Puritan ascendancy, with its distaste for all secular music, effectively put an end to the madrigal. Its loss involved that of many hundreds of dainty lyrics, including those of Campion, and it was due to the work of A. H. Bullen (see bibliography), who first published a collection of the poet's works in 1889, that his genius was recognised and his place among the foremost rank of Elizabethan lyric poets restored.[1]
Campion set little store by his English lyrics; they were to him "the superfluous blossoms of his deeper studies," but we may thank the fates that his ideas on rhymeless versification so little affected his work. His rhymeless experiments are certainly better conceived than many others, but they lack the spontaneous grace and freshness of his other poetry, while the whole scheme was, of course, unnatural. He must have possessed a very delicate musical ear, for not one of his songs is unmusical; moreover, his ability to compose both words and music gave rise to a metrical fluidity which is one of his most characteristic features.[1]
Rarely are his rhythms uniform, while they frequently shift from line to line. His range was very great both in feeling and expression, and whether he attempts an elaborate epithalamium or a simple country ditty, the result is always full of unstudied freshness and tuneful charm. In some of his sacred pieces, he is particularly successful, combining real poetry with genuine religious fervour. Some of Campion's works could also be quite ribald – such as "Beauty, since you so much desire".[1]
Early dictionary writers, such as Fétis, saw Campion as a theorist.[12] It was much later on that people began to see him as a composer. He was the writer of a poem, Cherry Ripe, which is not the later famous poem of that title but has several similarities.
In popular culture[edit]
Repeated reference was made to Campion in an October 2010 episode of the BBC TV series, James May's Man Lab (BBC2), where his works are used as the inspiration for a young man trying to serenade a female colleague. This segment was referenced in the second and third series of the programme as well.
Occasional mention is made of Campion ("Campian") in the comic strip 9 Chickweed Lane (i.e., 5 April 2004), referencing historical context for playing the lute.

On 10 February 1605, he received his medical degree from the University of Caen.[3]
Campion is thought to have lived in London, practising as a physician, until his death in March 1620 – possibly of the plague.[4] He was apparently unmarried and had no children. He was buried the same day at St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street.[1]

Poetry and songs[edit]




A Book of Ayres, 1601, with words by Campion and music by Philip Rosseter


The body of his works is considerable, the earliest known being a group of five anonymous poems included in the "Songs of Divers Noblemen and Gentlemen," appended to Newman's edition of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella, which appeared in 1591. In 1595, Poemata, a collection of Latin panegyrics, elegies and epigrams was published, winning him a considerable reputation. This was followed, in 1601, by a songbook, A Booke of Ayres, with words by himself and music composed by himself and Philip Rosseter. The following year he published his Observations in the Art of English Poesie, "against the vulgar and unartificial custom of riming," in favour of rhymeless verse on the model of classical quantitative verse. Campion's theories on poetry were criticized by Samuel Daniel in "Defence of Rhyme" (1603).[1]
In 1607, he wrote and published a masque[6] for the occasion of the marriage of Lord Hayes, and, in 1613, issued a volume of Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry, set to music by John Cooper (also known as Coperario). The same year he wrote and arranged three masques: The Lords' Masque for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth; an entertainment for the amusement of Queen Anne at Caversham House; and a third for the marriage of the Earl of Somerset to the infamous Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. If, moreover, as appears quite likely, his Two Bookes of Ayres[7] (both words and music written by himself) belongs also to this year, it was indeed his annus mirabilis.[1]
In 1615, he published a book on counterpoint, A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counterpoint By a Most Familiar and Infallible Rule,[8] a technical treatise which was for many years the standard textbook on the subject. It was included, with annotations by Christopher Sympson, in Playford's Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick, and two editions appear to have been published by 1660.[1][9]
Some time in or after 1617 appeared his Third and Fourth Booke of Ayres.[10] In 1618 appeared the airs that were sung and played at Brougham Castle on the occasion of the King's entertainment there, the music by George Mason and John Earsden, while the words were almost certainly by Campion. In 1619, he published his Epigrammatum Libri II. Umbra Elegiarum liber unus, a reprint of his 1595 collection with considerable omissions, additions (in the form of another book of epigrams) and corrections.[1]
Legacy[edit]
Campion made a nuncupative will on 1 March 1619/20 before 'divers credible witnesses': a memorandum was made that he did 'not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more', and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.[11]
While Campion had attained a considerable reputation in his own day, in the years that followed his death his works sank into complete oblivion. No doubt this was due to the nature of the media in which he mainly worked, the masque and the song-book. The masque was an amusement at any time too costly to be popular, and during the commonwealth period it was practically extinguished. The vogue of the song-books was even more ephemeral, and, as in the case of the masque, the Puritan ascendancy, with its distaste for all secular music, effectively put an end to the madrigal. Its loss involved that of many hundreds of dainty lyrics, including those of Campion, and it was due to the work of A. H. Bullen (see bibliography), who first published a collection of the poet's works in 1889, that his genius was recognised and his place among the foremost rank of Elizabethan lyric poets restored.[1]
Campion set little store by his English lyrics; they were to him "the superfluous blossoms of his deeper studies," but we may thank the fates that his ideas on rhymeless versification so little affected his work. His rhymeless experiments are certainly better conceived than many others, but they lack the spontaneous grace and freshness of his other poetry, while the whole scheme was, of course, unnatural. He must have possessed a very delicate musical ear, for not one of his songs is unmusical; moreover, his ability to compose both words and music gave rise to a metrical fluidity which is one of his most characteristic features.[1]
Rarely are his rhythms uniform, while they frequently shift from line to line. His range was very great both in feeling and expression, and whether he attempts an elaborate epithalamium or a simple country ditty, the result is always full of unstudied freshness and tuneful charm. In some of his sacred pieces, he is particularly successful, combining real poetry with genuine religious fervour. Some of Campion's works could also be quite ribald – such as "Beauty, since you so much desire".[1]
Early dictionary writers, such as Fétis, saw Campion as a theorist.[12] It was much later on that people began to see him as a composer. He was the writer of a poem, Cherry Ripe, which is not the later famous poem of that title but has several similarities.
In popular culture[edit]
Repeated reference was made to Campion in an October 2010 episode of the BBC TV series, James May's Man Lab (BBC2), where his works are used as the inspiration for a young man trying to serenade a female colleague. This segment was referenced in the second and third series of the programme as well.
Occasional mention is made of Campion ("Campian") in the comic strip 9 Chickweed Lane (i.e., 5 April 2004), referencing historical context for playing the lute.

Life[edit]
Campion was born in London, the son of John Campion, a clerk of the Court of Chancery, and Lucy (née Searle – daughter of Laurence Searle, one of the queen's serjeants-at-arms). Upon the death of Campion's father in 1576, his mother married Augustine Steward, dying soon afterwards. His stepfather assumed charge of the boy and sent him, in 1581, to study at Peterhouse, Cambridge as a "gentleman pensioner"; he left the university after four years without taking a degree.[1][2] He later entered Gray's Inn to study law in 1586. However, he left in 1595 without having been called to the bar.
On 10 February 1605, he received his medical degree from the University of Caen.[3]
Campion is thought to have lived in London, practising as a physician, until his death in March 1620 – possibly of the plague.[4] He was apparently unmarried and had no children. He was buried the same day at St Dunstan-in-the-West in Fleet Street.[1]
He was implicated in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury, but was eventually exonerated, as it was found that he had unwittingly delivered the bribe that had procured Overbury's death.[5]
Poetry and songs[edit]




A Book of Ayres, 1601, with words by Campion and music by Philip Rosseter


The body of his works is considerable, the earliest known being a group of five anonymous poems included in the "Songs of Divers Noblemen and Gentlemen," appended to Newman's edition of Sir Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella, which appeared in 1591. In 1595, Poemata, a collection of Latin panegyrics, elegies and epigrams was published, winning him a considerable reputation. This was followed, in 1601, by a songbook, A Booke of Ayres, with words by himself and music composed by himself and Philip Rosseter. The following year he published his Observations in the Art of English Poesie, "against the vulgar and unartificial custom of riming," in favour of rhymeless verse on the model of classical quantitative verse. Campion's theories on poetry were criticized by Samuel Daniel in "Defence of Rhyme" (1603).[1]
In 1607, he wrote and published a masque[6] for the occasion of the marriage of Lord Hayes, and, in 1613, issued a volume of Songs of Mourning: Bewailing the Untimely Death of Prince Henry, set to music by John Cooper (also known as Coperario). The same year he wrote and arranged three masques: The Lords' Masque for the marriage of Princess Elizabeth; an entertainment for the amusement of Queen Anne at Caversham House; and a third for the marriage of the Earl of Somerset to the infamous Frances Howard, Countess of Essex. If, moreover, as appears quite likely, his Two Bookes of Ayres[7] (both words and music written by himself) belongs also to this year, it was indeed his annus mirabilis.[1]
In 1615, he published a book on counterpoint, A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Counterpoint By a Most Familiar and Infallible Rule,[8] a technical treatise which was for many years the standard textbook on the subject. It was included, with annotations by Christopher Sympson, in Playford's Brief Introduction to the Skill of Musick, and two editions appear to have been published by 1660.[1][9]
Some time in or after 1617 appeared his Third and Fourth Booke of Ayres.[10] In 1618 appeared the airs that were sung and played at Brougham Castle on the occasion of the King's entertainment there, the music by George Mason and John Earsden, while the words were almost certainly by Campion. In 1619, he published his Epigrammatum Libri II. Umbra Elegiarum liber unus, a reprint of his 1595 collection with considerable omissions, additions (in the form of another book of epigrams) and corrections.[1]
Legacy[edit]
Campion made a nuncupative will on 1 March 1619/20 before 'divers credible witnesses': a memorandum was made that he did 'not longe before his death say that he did give all that he had unto Mr Phillip Rosseter, and wished that his estate had bin farre more', and Rosseter was sworn before Dr Edmund Pope to administer as principal legatee on 3 March 1619/20.[11]

Zumiez at South Shore Plaza in Braintree, Massachusetts


Zumiez Inc. is an American specialty clothing store founded by Tom Campion and Gary Haakenson in 1978, and publicly traded since 2005. "Offering gear and clothing for the skater, snowboarder, and surfer,"[2] Zumiez markets clothing for action sports, particularly skateboarding, snowboarding, and motocross. Zumiez is based in Lynnwood, Washington. The current president and CEO is Richard Brooks.[3]
Originally named "Above the Belt" when the first store was opened at Seattle's Northgate Mall in 1978, the company grew quickly through the early 80s with the addition of stores at Everett Mall (Everett, Washington), Alderwood Mall (Lynnwood, WA), Tacoma Mall (Tacoma, WA) and Bellevue Square (Bellevue, WA). The mid and late eighties brought new stores online outside of the Puget Sound area, and the corporate name changed to Zumiez pronounced Zoom-eez after popular skateboard game. The corporate office was moved from Everett to Lynnwood, Washington in 2012.

Stores[edit]
There are currently over 658 Zumiez stores across the United States and Canada. Zumiez is a leading retailer for lifestyle brands, centering on action sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding, BMX, and motocross.[4]
Image[edit]
Zumiez stores are designed with an "organized chaos" theme "that is consistent with many teenagers' lifestyles."[5] The stores are stocked with couches and video games to encourage customers "to shop for longer periods of time and to interact with each other and the store associates." Each store is approx. 2,900 sq. feet.[3] The stores generally feature a sales floor, a couch with video games and television, changing rooms, and a "skate shop." However, this plan may be modified based on space restrictions.
Couch Tour[edit]
For 13 years, Zumiez traveled to 12 "full stops" as part of its annual Couch Tour. Entertainment included live bands, professional skateboarding demos, and a competition featuring local amateurs.[6] The stops usually took place at the mall where local Zumiez stores are located. Entry to the event was always free.
As part of the Couch tour, since Zumiez doesn't sponsor riders themselves, they joined up with major players in the skate industry to offer an opportunity where amateur skaters can enter and compete. 2013 sponsors included Bones Bearings, Adidas, Deathwish, DGK, Neff, Oakley, and Loser Machine providing the "trophies" for each stop of the contest's winners.[7]

Zumiez Founder Tom Campion Shares Insight On Building A Sales Based Culture, Canadian Expansion, And Giving Back


October 28, 2010

                By lewism








Zumiez Founder Tom Campion
Love it or hate it, Zumiez has built a position in the market that commands respect, and no one at the company has done as much as Co-founder and Chairman Tom Campion to write its playbook of success over its 32-year history.

Campion, 62, opened his first store, Above the Belt, in Washington in 1978, which developed into the 396-door, mall-based action sports retailer Zumiez. To say that Campion—who started working retail in a grocery store in 1965, and later in management for JC Penney—has seen it all in the retail game is a vast understatement, but while he’s from the old school of valuing personal communications and relationship building over electronic communications, Zumiez has adapted and stayed ahead of the curve, improving store comps every year but one before the recession, and is back on track to make that happen again. Campion says Zumiez has achieved success by focusing on a sales-based culture, providing meaningful recognition and incentives such as its 100k sales event, and giving back to the sports and community to connect to something larger.

We caught up with Campion at the Seattle office of his Campion Foundation to learn more about the godfather of action sports retail’s strategies for success.

What were the biggest lessons you learned from working in the grocery business and then with Penney’s in the ’70s?
I learned I loved retail, but didn’t like the grocery business. I went to Penney’s, loved retail, but didn’t like the way they treated their people, but I learned a ton—what worked and what didn’t. That was pre computer and pre cell phone. You had to negotiate and understand how to work and buy.
I ran different departments and [discovered] what really worked: you pushed down authority and responsibility to your lead staff in the departments. Rather than some charger coming out telling [staff], “This is what we’re going to do,” I [learned] to say, “What do you want to do? What’s going to make it so we can have a comp store sales gain?” It worked really well and I took that philosophy on into Zumiez, starting with a couple employees, and me and my partner that started it. It isn’t always easy, but we’ve grown and perfected it— the team has— over the 32 years we’ve been in existence.
What didn’t you like about how Penney’s treated their people?
I always have had a little problem with authority—authority that’s not justified—“You do this because I’m the founder and I’m going to go out and play golf,” or some bullshit like that. Doesn’t that translate into problems throughout business or society? If you’re going to have vision and you’re going to lead, you got to lead by example not just by words.
How do you share your vision and strategy as the company grows and evolves?

You can’t do one thing one year, and a new one the next. There has to be consistency over time so [employees] know what’s coming. You have to believe it yourself and you have to be honorable about it. You’ve got to appreciate the fact that they’re working to make the sale. They are the face to your customer all the time. What you tell them has to be consistent.
You said at a past TransWorld Snow Conference, “The more power I have given away, the better this company has become.” What does that look like at the store level?
The manager runs his or her store and has, not total autonomy, but pretty good autonomy. They hire for their store. The goal is always to drive the ambition to grow. We’re going to grow comp store sales, we’re going to add new locations, and it’s their responsibility to train staff to grow the machine.

It’s interesting talking to your staff, at least at the 100k level [employees that sold over $100,000 in the year], they’re all really strong brand evangelists and proud of what they do. How do you instill that in them?
It’s the importance of saying thanks, of passing down responsibility and the complexity of what you’re doing. A human being’s a human being—they want more than to just stand there ringing things up. You don’t want robots, you want people that can think and use their talent to build the sale and teach somebody about the products.
You’ve got to incentivize it so [employees] have the opportunity to grow. The first year I did the 100k in the late ’80s, I took six kids out to dinner. It was a way to say thanks. Now, it gets emotional. A lot of these kids have been to five, six, seven of these. Imagine a kid that’s 18 to 25, working in the middle of Idaho or Colorado and he’s putting 200 grand in the till year-in and year-out. They’ll say to me; “I use to work for X retailer. They never did anything for me. I never met the guy in charge and you’re here saying ‘thank you.’ Wait until you see what I’m going to sell next year.” Frigging JC Penney himself, or Sam Walton couldn’t ask an employee to say more. In this competitive work environment to say I’m going to put it on the line, I’m going to work my butt off next year because I believe in what we’re doing here. It’s exactly what you want. It really works.
Culture costs money, and 100k costs a lot of money, but it’s core to who we are. [CEO] Rick [Brooks] got it from the get-go. He was my CFO and embraces that it isn’t just about the financial statement; it’s about the long-term vision, about how we’re going to grow. We announced to the market that we’re heading into Canada next year at some level and we think we can do that in other countries. Certain values consistently applied over a long period of time—you get the playbook down and it just seems to work.
Seems like a great way to focus you’re incentives on your key performers.
Yeah, we really believe it. I’m 62, Zumiez is 32 years old and listen to the emotion in my voice. It really works and it makes it fun. When the right person stays with you and grows, understands, has the energy level, buys into it, believes in what we’re doing, and you believe in each other, it is fun and you’ve got to have fun. It can’t just be “Do this, blah, blah, blah.” With the right team reinforcing that, that’s how you have comp store sales gains. In our first 29 to 30 years we had comp sales gains every year but one. One year we were down one point, then we got hit with this recession, and now we’re back to having comp sale gains.
How do you guys go about finding the right people, training them, and combining their values with yours?
You want somebody that’s in the lifestyle, surfs, skates, snowboards, listens to the music, [and] loves what we’re doing. The customer, like all of us, especially teenagers, can smell bullshit. They know if it’s authentic or not. Ultimately you can figure out what’s real and what’s fake, and we try and make it real and have kids work for us who understand what that is.
Maybe it’s an eight, or nine, or an 11-year-old coming in with his parent. It might be his first skateboard, or shopping for back to school, and having an employee that can understand the dynamic between the parent and the kid but also looks at the kid and talks with them. You set that first level of trust, and the employee likes what they do, is into the sport, connects with the kid; what you get out of that is not just a sale, but a good chance that you’re going to get a return customer and you’re going to own them for that eight, ten years where they’re into that lifestyle, through their teenage years and hopefully longer.
You can teach them [employees] certain techniques on selling, but oftentimes [people] have the god-given ability to sell something at regular price to another human being. That’s a talent that’s going to help you the rest of your life whether you’re hucking a skateboard or selling complex medical equipment or being a professor at college. You’ve got to deal with other humans. The whole idea that we’re just going to social network on the Web or whatever, you’ve got to be able to look someone in the eye and talk about where you skate, or the conditions up at Baker, or what kind of riding they do and relate.
Campion and a Zumiez employee at 100k in Keystone, Colorado
How do you personally stay connected to employees, a lot of whom were born after Zumiez started?
I started this pre-computer and before any cell phones, and kids look at me like I’m George frigging Washington, but that’s where you learn how to buy, learn how to sell, learn how to negotiate. You’re doing counts with five stores. You have somebody all day long calling up to see how many shirts they have to do reorders.
I read the journals, go to all our events, am deeply involved with the planning of them, executing them, and thanking our employees. I network across the company all year long, have conversations, calling people just to thank them. I travel a lot. Not specifically for Zumiez, also for other stuff I’m involved with. I’ll meet kids in stores at seven in the morning for anyone who wants to come. I just did a thing in Chicago, an event for the Alaska Wilderness League, and went to the store in Schaumburg—26 kids came out at seven in the morning until ten. It was packed in there—talking about product, what’s good, what’s not, what they’re doing well. They want to hear what I’m thinking, I want to hear what they’re thinking.
That’s one of many ways a company gets information. It’s a small way compared to the whole buying chain and the communication with stores there, but it keeps me connected. Then at the office, I’m still not as close as I used to be when I ran the buying team a while ago— over ten years ago now—but enough to understand looking at product reports; what’s selling, what’s not, and working with my president of all this Lynn Kilbourne, or my store director Ford Wright or Rick Brooks my CEO.
With your dedication to your staff, how do lawsuits such as the recent one over wages and lunch breaks affect you personally?
I can’t comment. Everybody sells. When I go in a store, I sell. When our store director [Ford Wright] goes in a store and someone needs help, he sells. It’s based around a culture of selling product to our customers. I think that’s enough said.
You do a lot of philanthropic work through the Campion and Zumiez foundations. Why is this important to you personally and for the business?
The year I started Zumiez in ’78, I started working in the environmental movement protecting old growth forests. I’m a big fan of public lands. We have 500-million acres in this country managed between the Forest Service, BLM, the Department of the Interior, etc., and it’s definitely an iconic American ideal—this public land that we all can enjoy. There are sustainability issues around public lands and around the protection of viable populations of wildlife that utilize public land. I’ve been in that forever.
I made a choice to start working in Alaska back in the mid-’90s because it’s a third of our public land. It’s got everything: climate change [issues], huge landscapes, indigenous people, big oil driving the bus, and politicians who just want to develop. You and I own it. It’s political will—is our will stronger than the person that just wants to drill baby drill?
It’s the same thing that works at Zumiez—having the willpower and getting the right guy on the bus who loves what they do.
When did you launch your foundation and what have been some of your biggest successes?
In 2005 when [Zumiez] went public. I’ve always given money, and as Zumiez has grown I’ve been able to give more. The last couple years we’ve given away $5 million a year, all from my selling of Zumiez stock.
You always hear in the endemic market about giving back to the sports and this sounds like something deeply rooted in all the things you’re interested in.
Zumiez has a foundation too that is a slightly different mission. Last year we gave away 50,000 jackets and about 30,000 wool blankets and cold weather gear. We gave it to I think 150 different agencies across the country including veteran’s agencies and cultural centers. The kids who work for me love it. They work for more than just a paycheck and more than just the lifestyle; they’re giving back.
We talk about that a lot. We also have a mission and a foundation to encourage philanthropic work among our employees. They pick what their passion is. We’ve had some kids do some interesting things. We had a kid in Minnesota start his own non profit to work with innercity kids who couldn’t get skateboards, and helped them get gear. But the kid that gets that and works with different things, they’re probably going to grow, and become a better employee. The whole idea is sharing and giving back. It’s beneficial not only for them personally to grow, but as they grow they become a better employee and it’s beneficial for Zumiez.

What’s your take when you hear the hate and vitriol from kids and small shops around the country that Zumiez isn’t core and doesn’t add to the sports?
When we got into skate and then snow in the late ’80s, there was a lot of that but we’re still standing and growing, funding sponsorship events, doing our own Couch Tour with an amateur contest where we’re pushing kids up to bigger events. I think we’re pretty core. It’s all the image of being in the mall versus a stand-alone store. I would ask what core is versus a pure retailer that’s just driven by price and oftentimes dodging state sales tax where they’re shipping it into another state?
I just talked to some elected officials about that where I’m employing kids in their state, trying to grow it, where the next guy, who’s a pure E-tailer can ship something in the state and not pay sales tax. I’m not only employing people in their state but collecting taxes that pay for teachers, and educate the kids that come to work for me, or the firemen. That’s something we need to correct and make it equitable for brick and mortar retailers across the country.
I will tell you, there’s a pecking order to competition in the mall from PacSun to Tilly’s to Industrial. We’re in business to keep growing. We understand that to do that, it’s great to have a competitor because it makes you sharper. I want that sale. I don’t want to give it to them. That’s good ol’ American retail 101 about growing and dominating the competition.. You got to have kids that want that, that want the sale, and believe in what they’re doing.
I’ve read that one of your business philosophies is to always reinvent yourself and your products to succeed. How are you doing that today to get Zumiez’s trajectory back up where it was before the recession?
We’re mixing up products, the vendors we carry, and the classifications. Some things are pretty core, like denim, t-shirts, screenables and stuff like that. We’re a branded store. We’re Americas branded independent retailer is what we say. That makes it somewhat easier. Price isn’t necessarily the answer to that, however some things, in the last  couple years, are more incentively priced and some things with this economy you just have to be patient and let the market come back. What started in the second-half of ’08 was the toughest I’ve ever seen it and I’ve been in retail since 1965. Sometimes it’s just a matter of having patience and explaining that to the kid that’s working for you rather than sitting there pounding on him or her because their store is comping down.

Poor service, 'get lost' attitude, no refund on stationery.
They told me you can get a refund only on the day of the purchase, but how is it possible if you get your delivery 60 days after purchasing???

Very disorganised



 



1 out of 5,
            


        reviewed on Mar 17, 2017    


I have had to order texts through this company for a few years now, primarily because the school chooses this supplier and some of the texts are only available through Campion. I have found this company to be late in providing texts for term 1 even after ordering the previous year.  I ordered a book back in January and still don't have it. It has been paid for in full but after a few phone calls they informed me that the book is made to order! Well that wasn't specified when ordered. Get your act together Campion.

Verified Purchase

Every year I dread having to deal with Campion.

How do they even exist?  It's ridiculous being forced to purchase from a business that clearly hates its customers, and they know we're all trapped with no other option.  I can't think of a single other business that has it so good.  If there were any other bookshop to get this stuff from I would go there.  There used to be a different one that we used to go to.  It was like shopping at Diagon Alley for Hogwarts.  Aisles of every kind of school supply you can imagine and filling our baskets was a joy.  But now there's only Campion.   Where they

 make you wait in queues reminiscent of customs in an airport- two queues- and then wait for your name to be called- could be an hour, could be two.  Alternatively you can order the stuff online and receive it in dribs and drabs over the course of term 1.  Sheesh.  There HAS to be a better way!

Don't use this business, campion book is the worst

My son is new to the school, and we had to order some text book from campion.  Then we found out that he was put in an accelerated maths class and he no longer need his current maths book which he hasn't use at all.  However, he fortunately put his name on a sticky tape on top of the book, in which he just peeled it off  and you can see a trace of it which I didn't.  The book is brand new, hasn't use it or anything, I and anyone would have just buy it myself again in that kind of condition anyhow.  So the cashier was doing a refund, she suddenl

y said to me in a very unfriendly voice, I can't refund this, it go his name on it.  I just took it from her and rub it and it just came off with no marks or anything, and handed it back to her, but still she won't refund me the money.  So I asked to talk to the manager, she came out, took the book and said no she can't refund it because it got dust and finger marks on it.  I can't believe this, off course it's got fingermarks on it, because we are all holding it.  Then I said I'll clean it and she almost threw the book at me and said if you can clean it I think about it, I just took the tissue and cleaned off the fingerprints and dusts.  And she still doesn't want to refund me, she took it around to her staffs and showed them and said some words to me which weren't polite about would you buy a book like this? Of course I would because it is brand new and hasn't been use, except it have left their shop!!!. I told her that Angus and Robertson wouldn't look at a returned book under a microscope like her, and she said we are not Angus and Robertson are we?  Talking about rude and bad manner , and this comes from a manager can you belive this?..  I wouldn't return a book if it's in bad condition in which they can't resell it, because I know people need to make a living, but this is horrible. Eventually I got the refund, but it just not worth the hassle. I  got two kids still at school for another 8 years or so but I would try to buy anything from Campion for sure.  You can't refund stationery, better get them from Office Work - it's cheaper and you can return easily!!!!

Seriously?

Every year I dread having to order from this business. Seriously, you order and PAY FOR THE ORDER IN FULL late November/early December and many of the books don't arrive until mid term one. For 2017 I have a year eleven student and NEEDED to ensure all books were received so she could review these prior to taking classes. The school has a great system at the end of the year where you can buy the books from the current year cohort and I always try and do this however the maths books were being reviewed and others I couldn't get hold of so I need

ed the new books. Week two and they are no-where in sight. Yep, the teacher has started the program and a few of the girls have them. We can't complete homework as we don't have the books nor can my daughter keep up in the class because she DOESNT HAVE THE BOOKS. The school does assist as much as they can however at the end of the day, CAMPION are responsible. Last year I recalled the English book they were reading arrived the last week of term one, the same week they FINISHED THE BOOK IN CLASS. Could I get a refund for the unopened book? No. This year I'm told the maths books are "on their way and now in the hands of Australia Post so not our problem anymore". I do pity the staff having to take these calls, I really do but SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I truly think someone like TODAY TONIGHT have to get into this business and publicly name and shame them. You'd think having the cash in the bank for two months would ensure they have sufficient supply.

Pathetic client service! They refused to let me speak to a supervisor or manager - so frustrating!!!

        reviewed on Feb 04, 2017    



We are new to this school and just wanted a seamless start for our girls. We didn't want them to have to worry about things like books! Instead their first week has been stressing about exactly that. 

Our daughter came home to tell us that she was the only one in the class without a maths book. I called Campion and was told we had ordered an e-book which was $57.95 which had been sent to us. I said we haven't received it. I was told if we wanted a text book that was $70 which also included the e-book. I said well of course for $12 extra we w
Read more 

ould have both the physical book and the e-book. No that's not possible I was told, as you have been issued with the e-book code. But we have not received it I said so can't we just be sent the book which will also include the e-book? No I was told. You have paid for the e-book and my job is to fulfill your order so I have just emailed you your e-code. I said I don't want to use it if it is going to exclude us from getting the physical book. I was told I could spend an additional $70 to purchase the book. When I said this was crazy and asked whether I could speak to someone else, a supervisor or manager, the person refused. She said there was nothing I could do. She said she worked in a call centre and there were no supervisors. I said surely there was someone at campion that I could speak to. No I was told. I asked there must be a manager at the company that I could speak to or write to. No I was told. I was provided with an email address - sales@campion and was advised that the email would go to the person I was speaking to in any event. 

I still have the email code I was emailed on Tuesday and my daughter has had no Maths book all week. I haven't used the code because I don't want to be excluded from getting the book so my daughter is still yet to do her Maths homework which is due after the weekend. My daughter is very stressed about it.

I have not even had a chance to seek help about our other issue with my other daughter because I've spent far too much time dealing with the first issue and being prevented from talking to anyone else. Client service 101 says that you need to be able to speak with your clients and have them talk to a supervisor when required.

I am so glad I read these reviews after receiving only part of what I thought I had ordered thru Campion Education. I have followed the advice of some of the Product Review people below and ordered a french book thru the Book Depository as when I discovered on Day One back at school, that it hadn't been delivered as part of the order I phoned Campion Education as to which Campion store in Perth I could find it. But I was told it was on back order! As I was not sure when the book would be available I looked on The Book Depository website and the

y had it in stock. Also the 2 files which seemed to have not been delivered with our order were available at Office Works. Maybe made in the same factory as the Campion Education ones but a different code.
The Campion Education staff member I talked to couldn't get me off the phone fast enough as she had phone calls which were backing up. She asked me to ring back when I was having trouble finding the code of the file. I had spent 10 minutes waiting to talk to her and was not about to do that again.
Campion Education need more staff who can fill orders with a lot more care and then they would not have this mess and now terrible reputation. They obviously cannot keep going the way they are as schools will not support them. Management of Campion Education need to have a serious look at how their business is run.

This is the first time I have written a review but felt I had to as the service I received through this company was absolutely awful and I have wasted days and hours of time I could have spent with my son on his last week of holidays instead of on the end of a phone.  I placed my Haileybury order before the cut of time and had confirmation of order arriving before 20th Jan.  Order didn't arrive and tracking number didn't exist and so my nightmare begun.  Over the next 11 days I spoke to 7sales people and 2 supervisors.  Parcel finally arrived a

fter apparently getting lost.... with half of the things missing and no sales docket.  Was told the missing items were on back order but after refusing to accept this explanation items were miraculously found and sent out.  I received 3 different parcels on same day but still had items missing.  Finally received all items except for one item (Ipad Stylus) and was promised by [Name Removed] (supervisor) last Wednesday that item was dispatched and being expressed to me.  Gave it 4 working days till yesterday afternoon as there had been a public holiday but of course it was a no show.  Contacted [Name Removed] again yesterday who again promised me it had been dispatched and would be delivered today. He emailed me a tracking number which again did not exsist!  I asked him to call me today at 4pm to confirm it had arrived so I would not be left in the usual telephone waiting line.  Didn't receive a phone call and received a parcel containing a text book I had already received not the Ipad Stylus as promised.  Contacted company again asking to speak to [Name Removed] who wasn't there and was given the usual run around that no supervisor was available.  Demanded I speak to a supervisor and was then put through to [Name Removed] who I asked to esculate this matter to a manager as I was not confident in dealing with the sales or supervising staff any further.  She stated this was not possible and wouldn't even give me a name of a manager.  She also stated that the Stylus had only come in today!!  Feel totally unrespected by this company by the obvious lies I have been fed and the run around I have been given. Obviously there are serious issues with this company and when dealing with resolutions they are totally unprofessional.  I have never dealt with a company who are so evasive and incompetent but as we know this can only come from the management above.  I did receive a refund of handling and delivery fees by [Name Removed] which wasn't freely offered but had to be asked for, however I really feel this is not anywhere near enough compensation for the time and frustration I endured due to this companies incompetence.

The school book order MUST go to Campion.com.au.  Campion promises Education Solutions.  However, each year their Victoria online ordering service is extremely bed!  
Each customer service officer advised differently.

This company, CAMPION EDUCATION (AUST) PTY LTD, does not issue Tax Invoice with online orders.  There is a Online Order Confirmation email, without any ABN number nor Tax Invoice number.

This company does NOT have a Complaint Department.  The company advised to contact Sales for complaint.

Campion motorcycles used a variety of proprietary engines including Minerva, MMC, Fafnir, Precision, Villiers, Blackburne and JAP.
They also supplied frames to other companies.

The Cyclecar was made only in 1913 and was powered by a JAP V twin with a rating of 8 hp. It used a friction transmission system and drove the rear wheels by a belt.[2]
