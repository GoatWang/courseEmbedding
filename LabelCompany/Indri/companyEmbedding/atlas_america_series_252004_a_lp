Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?

Finally taking that trip you’ve always dreamed of to the United States? Whether you’re planning to travel solo or with your family for work, school, or pleasure, you’re probably equal parts excited and stressed.
For international visitors unfamiliar with the U.S. healthcare system, questions of health and safety can be a major source of travel anxiety. Would you be able to seek treatment if you suffered an injury or unexpected illness while exploring the country? Would your medical expenses be covered by your home country health insurance policy?
If the answer to either of these questions is no, then it’s time to explore your travel medical insurance options.
What is Atlas America insurance?
Atlas America is a travel medical insurance policy for non-U.S. citizens and residents visiting the United States. Available to individuals, families, and groups, Atlas America insurance can cover individuals from most countries who are at least 14 days old and traveling to the U.S. from abroad.
Policies must cover a minimum of 5 days, though you do not have to travel all 5 days to be eligible for coverage. Coverage is available up to 364 days.

Why do I need insurance for my trip to the U.S.?
Your home country health insurance policy may not cover you across international lines – or it may provide very limited international coverage. And in the United States, people are responsible for their own healthcare costs, meaning you’ll be financially responsible for any medical expenses stemming from an unexpected illness or injury.
According to healthcare.gov, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to fix in the United States, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.
Travel medical insurance, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can reduce “the cost of a medical emergency" and the resulting “financial burden on travelers" by providing access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected occurs as you travel throughout the United States.
It can also serve as evidence that you’ll be able to pay for medical expenses incurred during your time in the U.S., which may be required if you need a visa to enter the country.


What benefits does Atlas America provide?
Atlas America insurance provides benefits for eligible medical expenses incurred in the U.S., including Hospital Room and Board, Local Ambulance, Emergency Medical Evacuation, Intensive Care Unit, and all other eligible costs.
It also provides supplemental travel benefits like Trip Interruption, Travel Delay, and Lost Checked Luggage.
Key features of Atlas America insurance include:

Up to $2,000,000 in maximum coverage per covered injury or illness and per certificate period
Your choice of deductible ranging from $0 to $2,500 per certificate period
Coinsurance at 80% of the next $5,000 of eligible expenses after the deductible, then 100% to the maximum coverage limit. Within the Preferred Provider Network (PPO), coinsurance is waived and eligible expenses are paid at 100% after the deductible, up to the overall maximum.
Provider network with over 5,000 hospitals and more than 90,000 healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.
Free travel assistance services available in multiple languages 365 days a year

Other Atlas America highlights:

Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D)

Does Atlas America meet visa requirements?
As a USA visitor, you may need a visa in order to gain entry to the United States. Whether or not you’ll need a visa is determined by your country of citizenship. The type of visa you'll need is dependent on the purpose of your travel.
Here are just a few common USA visitor visa types:

Visitor Visa: For people coming to the U.S. for a short period of time – typically 6 months or less – to visit children or relatives, tour, or vacation
Temporary Worker Visa: For individuals coming to the U.S. for a fixed period of time to receive job training or perform short-term or seasonal work
J-1 Visa: For USA visitors enrolling in work-and-study-based exchange programs in order to teach, study, conduct research, or receive on-site job training in the U.S.

In order to be approved for your visa, you’ll need to fulfill visa requirements. While your visa may not require you to have travel medical insurance, it may require you to show proof of funds to cover expenses incurred in the United States.
One way to evidence these funds is to purchase a travel medical policy like Atlas America, which provides policyholders with a visa letter to serve as proof of medical coverage.
Atlas America also meets the minimum insurance requirements of a J-1 visa as established by the U.S. Department of State.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas America Series 25-2004 (A) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on January 21, 2004 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; OTCQX: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of the ARP's general partner interest.  The Partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. The Partnership has no employees and relies on the MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  The Partnership's operating cash flows are generated from its wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. The Partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. The Partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling.  The economic viability of the Partnership's production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate (if the extraction is by means not involving drilling, completing or reworking a well). There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues.  The prices at which the Partnership's natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the Partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production. Changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the Partnership's cash flow and the value of its reserves. Lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the Partnership's revenues, but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the Partnership can produce economically.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2015, our MGP withheld $266,100 of net production revenue for this purpose.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2015 and 2014, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third-party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Transco Leidy Line, Columbia Appalachia, NYMEX and Transco Zone 5.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, Chevron Natural Gas accounted for approximately 65% of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 262 $ 745 Oil 49 116 Liquids 2 16 Total $ 313 $ 877 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 460 583 Oil (bbls/day) 3 4 Liquids (bbls/day) - 1 Total (mcfe/day) 478 613 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 1.56 $ 3.57 Oil (per bbl) $ 46.60 $ 88.60 Liquids (per bbl) $ 18.36 $ 50.15 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 145 % 76 % Per mcfe $ 2.60 $ 2.98 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.26 $ .64  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $14,100 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $262,400 and $744,800 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $482,400 (65%). The $482,400 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to a $325,400 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $157,000 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 460 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 583 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of  Oil Revenues. We drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $48,600 and $116,100 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $67,500 (58%). The $67,500 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $43,800 decrease in oil prices and a $23,700 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 2.86 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 3.59 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.73 bbl per day (20%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $2,400 and $16,200 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $13,800 (85%). The $13,800 decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $9,600 decrease in production volumes, and a $4,200 decrease in liquid prices. Our production volumes were 0.36 and 0.88 bbls per day for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of 0.52 (59%) bbls per day.  Gain on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. On January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives. As such, subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain on mark-to-market derivatives on our statements of operations. The fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners' capital on our balance sheet, will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle.  We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $11,800 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $454,500 and $664,100 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $209,600 (32%). This decrease was a result of lower transportation expenses due to lower natural gas sales prices and production volumes along with a decrease in operating fees and water hauling expenses as wells were shut-in due to being uneconomical in the current pricing environment.  Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 14% and 16% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.  General and administrative expenses were $123,400 and $134,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $11,000 (8%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us.  Impairment of gas and oil properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, was $705,700 and $1,460,100. At least annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook. We have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices. Our MGP continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs, including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs. Our MGP will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and, in turn, our liquidity to meet our operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or we experience other disruptions in the industry, our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP's decision to liquidate our operations.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of the Partnership's assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible that based on such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and liabilities of the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions to the limited partners.  Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $1,900 which decreased $153,600 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 when cash provided by operating activities was $151,700. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion, net non-cash loss on derivative value, impairment, and accretion of $354,300, a decrease in the change asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $229,100, a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $138,800, a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $3,400, partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $451,500, an increase in the payable to limited partners of $120,400 and an increase in asset retirement obligations settled of $100.  There was no cash provided by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by investing activities was $1,100 during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the sale of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $210,700 to $1,900 for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $212,600 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2015, our MGP has withheld $266,100 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  Impairment  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairment expense of $705,700 and $1,460,100, respectively, related to gas and oil properties within property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet. These impairments relate to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that such changes will continue. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials; and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or threatened or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within . . .  Apr 15, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas America Series 25-2004 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on January 21, 2004 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; OTCQX: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of the ARP's general partner interest.  The Partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee and West Virginia. The Partnership has no employees and relies on the MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  The Partnership's operating cash flows are generated from its wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. The Partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. The Partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling.  The economic viability of the Partnership's production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate (if the extraction is by means not involving drilling, completing or reworking a well). There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues.  The prices at which the Partnership's natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the Partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production. Changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the Partnership's cash flow and the value of its reserves. Lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the Partnership's revenues, but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the Partnership can produce economically.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2015, our MGP withheld $322,300 of net production revenue for this purpose.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2015 and 2014, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third-party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Transco Leidy Line, Columbia Appalachia, NYMEX and Transco Zone 5.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, Chevron Natural Gas and Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC accounted for approximately 60% and 10%, respectively of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.  Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 291 $ 769 Oil 43 97 Liquids 6 26 Total $ 340 $ 892 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 480 577 Oil (bbls/day) 2 3 Liquids (bbls/day) 1 1 Total (mcfe/day) 498 601 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 1.66 $ 3.69 Oil (per bbl) $ 48.91 $ 89.86 Liquids (per bbl) $ 18.70 $ 49.95 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 144 % 79 % Per mcfe $ 2.68 $ 3.21 Depletion per mcfe $ 0.37 $ 1.25  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $8,700 for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $291,300 and $769,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $478,100 (62%). The $478,100 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $348,900 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $129,200 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 480 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 577 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 97 (17%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (see item 1:"Business-Contractual Revenue Arrangements"). Thus, the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions. The decrease in production volumes is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells in addition to wells shut-in due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing environment.  Oil Revenues. We drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $42,800 and $96,700 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $53,900 (56%). The $53,900 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $35,800 decrease in oil prices and a $18,100 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 2.40 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 2.95 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.55 bbl per day (19%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $5,600 and $25,500 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $19,900 (78%). The $19,900 decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $10,500 decrease in production volumes, and a $9,400 decrease in liquid prices. Our production volumes were 0.82 and 1.40 bbls per day for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of 0.58 (41%) bbl per day.  Gain on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. On January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives. As such, subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain on mark-to-market derivatives on our statements of operations. The fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners' capital on our balance sheet, will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle.  We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $12,900 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $488,000 and $706,900 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $218,900 (31%). This decrease was a result of lower transportation expenses due to lower natural gas sales prices and production volumes as wells were shut-in due to being uneconomical in the current pricing environment.  Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 20% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities and to a lesser extent revenues, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.  General and administrative expenses were $132,800 and $145,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $12,600 (9%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the costs and services provided to us.  Impairment of gas and oil properties during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $763,300 and $2,334,600, respectively. At least annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners.  The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook. We have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices. Our MGP continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs, including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs. Our MGP will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and, in turn, our liquidity to meet our operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or we experience other disruptions in the industry, our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP's decision to liquidate our operations.  Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted, as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of the Partnership's assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible that based on such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and liabilities of the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions to the limited partners.  There was no cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities were $152,200 the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion, net non-cash (gain) loss on derivative value, impairment, and accretion of $325,600, a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $289,700, a decrease in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $139,100, a decrease in accrued liabilities of $2,000, partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $550,200, an increase in the change in the amounts payable to limited partners of $53,900, and an increase in the change in asset retirement obligation settled of $100, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.  There was no cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 were $200 resulting from the sale of tangible equipment.  There was no cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash used in financing activities was $169,700 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2015, our MGP has withheld $322,300 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  Impairment  During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairment expense of $763,300 and $2,334,600, respectively, related to gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that such changes will continue. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials; and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or threatened or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements (see "item 8:Financial Statements") included in this . . .  Apr 15, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

be filed within the prescribed time period.  The Registrant is unable to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2016 by
the prescribed due date as a result of unexpected delays in the completion of its financial statements and related portions of its Form 10-Q due to the continued weakened state of oil and natural gas commodity prices. Such delays could not be

	to
	materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
	reporting; and












	5.  





	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our
	most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting,
	to
	the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s

	and









	b)  





	Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
	employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control

Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Finally taking that trip you’ve always dreamed of to the United States? Whether you’re planning to travel solo or with your family for work, school, or pleasure, you’re probably equal parts excited and stressed.
For international visitors unfamiliar with the U.S. healthcare system, questions of health and safety can be a major source of travel anxiety. Would you be able to seek treatment if you suffered an injury or unexpected illness while exploring the country? Would your medical expenses be covered by your home country health insurance policy?
If the answer to either of these questions is no, then it’s time to explore your travel medical insurance options.
What is Atlas America insurance?
Atlas America is a travel medical insurance policy for non-U.S. citizens and residents visiting the United States. Available to individuals, families, and groups, Atlas America insurance can cover individuals from most countries who are at least 14 days old and traveling to the U.S. from abroad.
Policies must cover a minimum of 5 days, though you do not have to travel all 5 days to be eligible for coverage. Coverage is available up to 364 days.

Why do I need insurance for my trip to the U.S.?
Your home country health insurance policy may not cover you across international lines – or it may provide very limited international coverage. And in the United States, people are responsible for their own healthcare costs, meaning you’ll be financially responsible for any medical expenses stemming from an unexpected illness or injury.
According to healthcare.gov, a broken leg can cost up to $7,500 to fix in the United States, and the average cost of a 3-day hospital stay is around $30,000.
Travel medical insurance, as noted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), can reduce “the cost of a medical emergency" and the resulting “financial burden on travelers" by providing access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected occurs as you travel throughout the United States.
It can also serve as evidence that you’ll be able to pay for medical expenses incurred during your time in the U.S., which may be required if you need a visa to enter the country.


What benefits does Atlas America provide?
Atlas America insurance provides benefits for eligible medical expenses incurred in the U.S., including Hospital Room and Board, Local Ambulance, Emergency Medical Evacuation, Intensive Care Unit, and all other eligible costs.
It also provides supplemental travel benefits like Trip Interruption, Travel Delay, and Lost Checked Luggage.

Up to $2,000,000 in maximum coverage per covered injury or illness and per certificate period
Your choice of deductible ranging from $0 to $2,500 per certificate period
Coinsurance at 80% of the next $5,000 of eligible expenses after the deductible, then 100% to the maximum coverage limit. Within the Preferred Provider Network (PPO), coinsurance is waived and eligible expenses are paid at 100% after the deductible, up to the overall maximum.
Provider network with over 5,000 hospitals and more than 90,000 healthcare facilities throughout the U.S.

As a USA visitor, you may need a visa in order to gain entry to the United States. Whether or not you’ll need a visa is determined by your country of citizenship. The type of visa you'll need is dependent on the purpose of your travel.
Here are just a few common USA visitor visa types:

Visitor Visa: For people coming to the U.S. for a short period of time – typically 6 months or less – to visit children or relatives, tour, or vacation
Temporary Worker Visa: For individuals coming to the U.S. for a fixed period of time to receive job training or perform short-term or seasonal work
J-1 Visa: For USA visitors enrolling in work-and-study-based exchange programs in order to teach, study, conduct research, or receive on-site job training in the U.S.

In order to be approved for your visa, you’ll need to fulfill visa requirements. While your visa may not require you to have travel medical insurance, it may require you to show proof of funds to cover expenses incurred in the United States.
One way to evidence these funds is to purchase a travel medical policy like Atlas America, which provides policyholders with a visa letter to serve as proof of medical coverage.
Atlas America also meets the minimum insurance requirements of a J-1 visa as established by the U.S. Department of State.
