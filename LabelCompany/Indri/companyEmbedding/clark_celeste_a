Celeste A. Clark







 Celeste A. ClarkGlobal Executive Management Team (retired), Kellogg Company


Visit Kellogg's Site


Dr. Celeste A. Clark is a retired senior executive of Kellogg Company where she was a member of the Global Executive Management Team, and had an accomplished career spanning nearly 35 years in the food industry. She was responsible for leading the development and implementation of health, nutrition and regulatory science initiatives, and working globally to ensure consistency in approach and implementation within regulatory guidelines. One of the most noted examples of her career was the collaboration with the National Cancer Institute on the development of a ground-breaking educational campaign on diet and cancer prevention, which ultimately led to health claims regulations in the United States, and became the forerunner for the use of health claims internationally.
Dr. Clark was responsible for Kellogg’s Global Nutrition Team, and worked with the Research, Quality and Technology Group to strengthen the nutritional value of the company’s product offerings. This included a focus on both innovation and renovation, where efforts were directed to reduce the levels of nutrients of concern, and to add and/or increase the nutrients of need to meet the various demands of consumers globally. She has extensive experience in front-of- pack labeling, having worked to ensure a fact-based approach was adopted globally on Kellogg brands.
Dr. Clark also served as President, Kellogg Corporate Citizenship Fund, the company’s philanthropic entity. In this capacity, she was responsible for providing grants that aligned with business objectives in the communities served by Kellogg globally. The primary areas of focus were community engagement, economic development, arts and education, and health and wellness initiatives. Corporate reputation management and corporate social responsibility (CSR) were integral to the work performed. As Chief Sustainability Officer, she worked with the company’s operational team to help ensure that the sourcing, manufacture and distribution of food products were aligned with the efficient use of environmental resources. This was enabled by establishing environmental targets, developing programs to achieve targets, and monitoring progress. Under her leadership, the first CSR report was released.
She has also collaborated with governments, academic institutions, health professional organizations, and food industry representatives globally to develop consensus and/or collaborate on initiatives aimed to increase consumer understanding of nutrition. She has been involved in numerous public health symposia as a guest speaker in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Europe. She also served on the National Academies of Sciences’ Committee on Capitalizing on the Diversity of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, and the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Childhood Obesity Prevention.
Dr. Clark has board governance experience in public and private companies and non-profit organizations. She is an independent director of the Mead Johnson Nutrition Company and AdvancePierre Foods, and AAA Michigan. She previously served as a director of Diamond Foods prior to its acquisition by Snyder’s-Lance Corporation in February 2016. She is a trustee of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and is engaged in non-profit work both domestically and internationally to improve the lives and outcomes for vulnerable children and their families. She is the principal ofAbraham Clark Consulting, LLC and consults on nutrition and health policy, regulatory affairs, and leadership development.
Dr. Clark serves as adjunct professor at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition. She is also an invited guest lecturer/speaker at other universities on food and health policy, leadership, and philanthropy. She has also established several “Future Leaders and Mentoring” Scholarships where she engages in coaching and mentoring first generation college students and works with them to secure extended learning opportunities, including internships and international experiences.
Dr. Clark is a member of the American Society of Nutrition, the Institute of Food Technology, and various local and civic organizations. She is married, and has two adult children.

 Clarks Artisan Leather Ankle Boots w/ Fringe - Spye Celeste

 Love It
 This boot is darling and right on trend. I'm glad I didn't size up like some reviews suggested. I'm a true 7.5 and I ordered my exact size. Fits perfect. Very comfortable right out of the box. The heel does slip a little but anyone who wears riding boots or cowboy boots knows that is typical. There is slightly more padding in the heel than at the ball of the boot. But not a huge deal. Such an adorable quality boot.

 Great Boot, Runs Big
 This boot is generously cut, but works great for my medium tending towards wide feet. If you have narrow feet, you probably want to stay away from this style. I can wear it with medium weight socks and have room to spare, particularly in the heel. The style is really cute and the heel height is perfect. Some might be able to size down half or even one whole size, but I hesitate to recommend that, because for me the length was good. I usually wear and 8.5 medium, sometimes a 9, depending on the toe shape and shoe design and I got this in the 8.5.

 ARTISAN BEAUTIFUL BUT OFF BEAT
 I am a HUGE Clark's fan. And sometimes their boots run a tad large on my narrow foot. So that's why I sometimes go down 1/2 size. I ordered anyway, because of the gorgeous styling. Very proud of Clark's for giving us more of that. The black pair arrived this am. I have them on in 9 1/2 black. For this type of boot, I don't think the leather is too stiff. Beautiful craftsmanship. Cute Western boot heel. This look is great if you don't really want a true Western boot. This size is good length-wise, but the heel is the problem for me. I will get some heel pads that will fill up the space. My heels are now more narrow still than the vamp of my foot. They are just adorable. Not uncomfortable really at all. Too much room in the heels. I really wear a 10, so I am writing this to say you need to go down 1/2 size. They narrow at the vamp to the toe, so it isn't the roomiest toe box. Not severe narrowing though. Just try them if you love the style. I have the tan coming in 10 M and I know I'll have to send them back. Not available in 9 1/2 right now in the tan.
Thanks QVC for continuing to bring your customers up to the minute styling and great craftsman like Clark's. Oh, and the back zippers in mine are sewn beautifully. Just tight and need to be used--beautiful tassel.

 Purchased my regular size for Clarks but they are too big. I ordered two pair because they are so cute...both are going back.

 Honestly, I'm a huge Clarks fan...but these are certainly not "true to size" ...not even close!!
The boot is beautiful; great details and look! I'm not certain if sizing down a half size would even help. The presentation should contain accurate information regarding sizing, as return shipping costs are always a factor with QVC. Hope this will be taken into consideration in future presentations!

 Pretty Little Bootie
 I am pretty obsessed with these botties. I wear them with everything: Jeans, jeggings, and leggings. I love how they have a boho look to them without being over-the-top. This is truly the perfect ankle boot for fall.

 True to size for me but when I put them on needed more padding in the heel. They would slide up and did not grasp my foot well. Very stylish, pretty, and comfortable. Oh well item is going back. To much money for not a well fit.

 Good Design
 Love these boots. They are well designed and comfortable. They need more padding in the heel, but am hopeful that they will be fine for a full day's wear. I will say that the sewing around the zippers is the worst I have ever seen. Looks like a child with no experience put in the zippers (on both the black and brown pairs). Very surprising for a boot at this price point.

 Loooove the look of this babe, buttttt, I could never dance in them. Just walking I felt as if I could step right out of them, and I felt I didn't have complete control of my foot. Don't know why they changed the last on her, and sad that they did.

 Runs very large
 Wish I'd had the sizing information before ordering - the 9s were huge, and I often wear a 9 in Clarks. Back it goes.

 This is very surprising, as I have several pairs of Clarks shoes and they are very comfortable. The sole is hard and the inside does not have much padding. The shoe looks great but NOT comfortable. Returned them.
 09-25-14
 WAY TOO BIG
 Sizing was way off they where wide and long ...ordered my regular size 11M and need a size 10M in these I think ..but could even go to 91/2 thats how loose they where on my foot. Unfortune for cause thay are sold out.So tired of paying for return shipping when you think your ordering what you know is your size but the host doesn't tell you they run big.

      Meet Celeste A. Clark, Ph.D.

Financial support is one of the best ways graduates can show appreciation for the education and development they have received from their alma mater. One such graduate is Celeste A. Clark, Ph.D., who through her affiliation with the W.K. Kellogg Company, has directed more than $100,000 in philanthropic support to Southern University. Clark’s efforts have led to the establishment of the Human Nutrition and Food Departmental Scholarship and the Bayou Classic Scholarship.

Clark is a retired senior executive of Kellogg Company in Battle Creek, Michigan where she led global public policy and external affairs and served as chief sustainability officer. In her nearly 35 years with Kellogg Company, Clark was responsible for global health policy, nutrition and regulatory science globally to ensure consistency around the world. She led the Global Nutrition Team’s work with the company’s Research, Quality and Technology Group, and the business units to strengthen the nutritional value of products offered with a focus on both innovation and renovation.
“Celeste is a global success in corporate America, but more specific in the field of nutrition. She is a testimony to the quality of preparation a young person can receive at Southern University,” said Joseph M. Stewart, retired senior vice president of Kellogg Company, co-founder of Stewart Industries, and W.K. Kellogg Foundation Trustee.
The Colfax, Louisiana native has been a director of Mead Johnson Nutrition Company since 2011 and has been an Independent Director of Diamond Foods, Inc. since 2014.
Clark serves as principal of Abraham Clark Consulting, LLC and is an adjunct professor at Michigan State University in the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition.
She is a member of the Executive Leadership Council and has received numerous awards and recognition including Working Mother Magazine’s “Working Mother of the Year,” Progressive Grocer’s “Woman of the Year,” and named one of Ebony Magazine’s “100 Top Black Executives in Corporate America.”
Clark received a bachelor’s of science in food and nutrition from Southern University in 1975 and a master’s degree in nutrition from Iowa State University. She received a doctorate in food science and human nutrition from Michigan State University.
