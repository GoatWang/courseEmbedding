                                                    A classic for over 130 years, Buchanan’s 12-year old whisky, one of the world’s most iconic and awarded luxury Scotch whisky brands. It has a soft and fruity flavor, with orange and chocolate notes that allow it to be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with a strip of orange peel. 

                                                

                                                    Originally called Buchanan’s Finest Liquor, this whisky received the first label James Buchanan ever put his name onto. It has a soft and fresh profile that separates it from other more dense whisky profiles.
                                                







It has orange and chocolate notes, perfect to be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with a strip of orange peel.




































                                                    Winner of a double gold medal in the 2014 World Spirits Competition in San Francisco, Buchanan’s Master honors the malt’s flavor and blend over the aging.
                                                

                                                    It is a blend of malts, at least one from every region in Scotland, hand-picked by our Master Blender, Keith Law, one of the most prestigious names in whisky worldwide.
                                                







Due to its herbal and citric notes, Buchanan’s Master can be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with peppermint and rosemary leaves.




































                                                    Is a blend of grain whiskies and single malts aged for at least 18 years in oak barrels that used to hold sherry. With a silky and delicate liquid, Buchanan’s 18 Special Reserve is a distinctive rich and well-rounded whisky with flavors of citrus, nuts, honey and oak.

                                                

                                                    Buchanan’s 18 Year Old Special Reserve’s is an icon of excellence among Scotch connoisseurs.
                                                













We recommend serving it neat, or on the rocks.

                                                    A classic for over 130 years, Buchanan’s 12-year old whisky, one of the world’s most iconic and awarded luxury Scotch whisky brands. It has a soft and fruity flavor, with orange and chocolate notes that allow it to be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with a strip of orange peel. 

                                                

                                                    Originally called Buchanan’s Finest Liquor, this whisky received the first label James Buchanan ever put his name onto. It has a soft and fresh profile that separates it from other more dense whisky profiles.
                                                







It has orange and chocolate notes, perfect to be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with a strip of orange peel.

                                                    It is a blend of malts, at least one from every region in Scotland, hand-picked by our Master Blender, Keith Law, one of the most prestigious names in whisky worldwide.
                                                







Due to its herbal and citric notes, Buchanan’s Master can be served on the rocks or with soda, garnished with peppermint and rosemary leaves.




































                                                    Is a blend of grain whiskies and single malts aged for at least 18 years in oak barrels that used to hold sherry. With a silky and delicate liquid, Buchanan’s 18 Special Reserve is a distinctive rich and well-rounded whisky with flavors of citrus, nuts, honey and oak.

                                                

                                                    Buchanan’s 18 Year Old Special Reserve’s is an icon of excellence among Scotch connoisseurs.
                                                













We recommend serving it neat, or on the rocks.
