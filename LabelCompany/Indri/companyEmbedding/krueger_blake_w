In 2012, Wolverine World Wide completed one of the largest acquisitions ever in the footwear industry when it bought Collective Brands’ Performance + Lifestyle Group for $1.24 billion. The deal transforms Wolverine into the third-largest footwear company in the world behind giants Nike and Adidas.
“Given that Wolverine markets 16 footwear brands in over 200 countries and territories around the world, taking a global view of the macro-economic environment is inherent in our DNA and mindset.
“For the next several years, we expect the global economic environment to continue to be more volatile and challenging than the historical norm. While each region has its own challenges, slow (or slowing) GDP growth, low consumer confidence and double-dip recessions appear to be universally front-and-center concerns. Fundamentally, the world is in the process of deleveraging, with many municipalities, states and countries overspending and overpromising for the last 50 years. On this scale, deleveraging will be politically and socially very difficult, as we have already begun to see in Europe.
“However, there are always winners in every macro-economic environment and opportunities to generate growth — it just takes more focus and commitment than it does when times are good. For example, my team has been able to drive company revenue to record levels in four of the last five years. How was this achieved? By the relentless execution of our ‘three-legged’ global brand-building model, which is centered on — 1) innovative footwear; 2) brand extensions into apparel and accessories; and 3) the expansion of our consumer-direct businesses. Finally, while the footwear industry is not recession-proof, there is always a good deal of consumer ‘need’ as well as ‘want,’ allowing our industry to do relatively well in more challenging times because the purchase of a new pair of shoes can be an easy way for a person to feel good when times are tough.”

Good morning and welcome to Wolverine World Wide Fourth Quarter 2015 Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference call. This call is being recorded at the request of Wolverine World Wide. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would now like to introduce Mr. Chris Hufnagel, Vice President of Strategy, Investor Relations and Communications for Wolverine World Wide. Mr. Hufnagel, you may proceed.
Christopher E. Hufnagel - VP-Strategy, Communications & Investor Relations
Thank you, Ed. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2015 conference call. On the call today are Blake Krueger, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Earlier this morning, we announced our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2015 along with our 2015 full year results. The release is available on many news sites or it can be viewed from our corporate website at wolverineworldwide.com. If you'd prefer to have a copy of the news release sent to you directly, please call Tyler Deur at 616-233-0500.
This morning's press release included non-GAAP disclosures, and these disclosures were reconciled with attached tables within the body of the release. Comments during today's earnings call will include some additional non-GAAP disclosures. There is a document posted on our corporate website entitled, WWW Q4 2015 Conference Call Supplemental Tables, that will reconcile these non-GAAP disclosures to GAAP. The document is accessible under the Investor Relations tab at our corporate website, wolverineworldwide.com, by clicking on the webcast link at the top of the page.
Before we start, I want to provide some additional context and information. When speaking to revenue growth, Blake and Mike will primarily refer to underlying revenue growth, which adjusts for the impact of foreign exchange and excludes revenue from store closures and the exited Patagonia Footwear and Cushe businesses. We believe underlying growth best reflects how our global businesses are performing in the marketplace. In addition, we will be providing adjusted financial results, which exclude restructuring and impairment, acquisition-related integration costs, and debt extinguishment costs and constant currency results.
Where appropriate, we'll also provide reported results, and as always, you can find tables reconciling these disclosures in our earnings release and on our corporate website. As an additional note, our fiscal 2015 was a 52-week period versus a 53-week period in 2014. As such, our fourth quarter 2015 had one less week when comparing to 2014. The extra week in 2014 accounted for approximately $7.5 million revenue or approximately 100 basis points of growth in 2015.

Finally, for the purposes of this call we report our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results in our former brand operating group structure. We will begin reporting results in our new brand structure, which was announced on February 4, with the first quarter of 2016.
Now, before I turn the call over to Blake to comment on our results, I'd like to remind you that predictions and projections made during today's conference call regarding Wolverine World Wide and its operations are forward-looking statements under U.S. Securities laws. As a result, we must caution you that as with any prediction or projection, there are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially. These important risk factors are identified in the company's SEC filings and in our press releases.
With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Blake Krueger. Blake?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year results for 2015. We're pleased to have delivered strong adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter, $0.33 per share, which translates into a 33% increase on a constant currency basis. The company also delivered revenue in line with guidance, $751.2 million for the quarter. These results, especially our earnings performance, are noteworthy in what continued to be a choppy global retail environment impacted by soft consumer demand.
In this challenging landscape, our business model, strong brand (4:26) quickly to mitigate headwinds proved to be critically important in generating quality results, largely due to our early recognition of the overall retail and global consumer environment. While our full-year financial performance did not live up to our original expectations, we continued to invest in our brands and talent to drive future growth. I was proud of our team's ability to adjust to the volatile and fast-changing retail marketplace and drive the business forward to close the year.
As we start the new year, I'm pleased to report that we've made significant progress against our key strategic initiatives. We took important steps to strengthen the company and to position our portfolio of brands for success in 2016 and beyond. Over the past 12 months, we better positioned Merrell, Sperry, and Saucony, our three largest brands, for further growth expansion as leading head-to-toe lifestyle brands. We further expanded our international footprint, already one of the best in the industry, by executing 121 distribution agreements in 2015.
We accelerated eCommerce growth, which was up nearly 20% year-over-year and almost 25% in Q4, through investments in talent and resources and by leveraging our new digital platform. We continued to execute against our strategic realignment plan and further optimized the components of our store operations in pursuit of future growth and profitability. And finally, we reorganized our brand operating group structure and senior leadership team, which positions us to better capitalize on the global opportunities we have for our family of brands.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to accelerating growth through key strategic initiatives focused on product innovation and deeper consumer insights and connections, which I will provide more detail on in a moment, all supported by our strong operating platform and extensive global distribution footprint.
For today's call, I'll touch on brand operating group results for the year and then spend the majority of my time taking you through a strategic overview of the company. Mike Stornant will provide more detail on 2015 Q4 and full-year results as well as 2016 guidance. Focusing on our full-year brand operating group performances starting with the Performance Group. Underlying revenue grew at 6.3% versus the prior year, led by exceptional growth in Chaco, which posted growth of better than 50%, Saucony which grew at a low-teens rate, and Merrell which added growth in the low-single digits.

Underlying revenue for the Lifestyle Group was down less than 1%, with Sperry growing low-single digits, Keds up mid-single digits and Stride Rite down low-single digits, driven primarily from planned store closures. Hush Puppies saw an underlying revenue decline in the low-teens due to our decision to exit some domestic distribution. Encouragingly, the brand's international third-party business remains strong, with revenue growth in the low-teens on a constant currency basis.
Underlying revenue for the Heritage Group was flat, with Cat and Harley-Davidson growing low-single digits, Wolverine down low-single digits and Bates and HYTEST producing mid-single digit growth.
I'll now use this opportunity to outline the company's strategic direction and our progress on the key priorities for the business in the coming year. We take a very active approach in managing our global brand portfolio to ensure that we aggressively fuel growth and take advantage of opportunities in key markets around the world.
Over the last year, we've executed on our multi-year demand creation investment strategy and also focused on Saucony, Chaco and eCommerce. At the same time, we responsibly addressed underperforming businesses, including the exit of the Cushe brand, and took actions to improve the performance of our retail stores. We've also recently taken action to accelerate our global apparel and accessories initiatives across the organization. All of these moves are designed to drive growth, increase profitability and create value for our shareholders.
Over the past few months, we've taken a number of important steps. First, let's start with the actions we've executed in our retail store operations. Stride Rite plays an important role as a children's expert in our portfolio and has a profitable and healthy wholesale and eCommerce business. However, its store business has underperformed. Consequently, in 2015 we accelerated store closures and improved the performance of the go-forward stores by infusing new leadership and applying a sharp focus to the business during the all-important back-to-school and holiday season. As a result, we saw the year-over-year comparative sales trends improve over 500 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters of the year.
Encouragingly, these better results have continued and accelerated in early 2016. In November, to further align and leverage all of our direct-to-consumer operations, Stride Rite was moved into a consolidated Consumer Direct Group. Looking ahead to 2016, we will close more stores as part of our strategic realignment plan, improve the profitability of our go-forward stores and fuel our rapidly growing eCommerce business. Performance of our retail stores has improved significantly and we're encouraged about the direction of the business today.
We recognize that our apparel and accessory initiatives have not evolved at an acceptable pace. And during Q4, we took the action to accelerate growth in these important categories. Many of our brands have significant global lifestyle opportunities and continued expansion beyond footwear is a critical strategic initiative for the company.
To accelerate our progress, we centralized all of our brand, apparel and accessory teams under a new seasoned leader to coordinate efforts and to take advantage of the opportunities across the portfolio. There's much more to come here, but these changes put us in a much better position to win. And thus far, I'm encouraged by our progress.
We firmly believe that growth starts with intimately knowing our consumers, including who they are, what they want and how we can better exceed their expectations. In 2016, we will significantly increase our investments in consumer insights, more than doubling our people and resources in this area. Better and more meaningful consumer insights will directly benefit our product design and innovation engine.

We will amplify trend research and roll out a new Innovation and Design Center focused on the consumer, product design and marketing. The Innovation and Design Center will act as a powerful catalyst for innovation across the organization and play a critical role in influencing the future of the company, directly driving vital growth projects and new technology introductions and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Through consumer insights, product innovation and compelling marketing, we remain focused on organically growing our brands around the world.
Turning briefly to external growth initiatives. We have a successful 20-year track record of adding brands to our portfolio and we'll continue our pursuit of potential acquisition opportunities. Our capital structure and organizational readiness gives us the capability to take on a strategic acquisition. And M&A has been and continues to be a core competency of the organization.
Since the close of our most recent acquisition, we've reduced our net debt by nearly $550 million. This said, we have a well-defined set of acquisition criteria against which we evaluate all opportunities and are not operating against any internal timeline to execute the next acquisition. Today, accelerating organic growth is our priority, but it's also important to monitor potential acquisitions in the event the right strategic fit and value-enhancing opportunity becomes available to the company.
Switching gears, I'd now like to spend a few minutes focusing on Merrell, Sperry, Saucony, the three largest brands in our portfolio. Merrell is positioned to go-to-market in 2016 with a comprehensive and exciting plan, delivering new product, amplified marketing, and strong execution at retail. New product introductions are planned to create big stories, enable the brand to build on its winning Moab and Capra collections through an expanded product line and strategic distribution segmentation. The Moab franchise is already the industry's best-selling lightweight hiking shoe, and Capra is expected to pass 1 million pairs this year.
Merrell also plans to lead our brand in introducing the game-changing Arctic Grip, anti-slip technology, which improves traction up to three times on wet, icy surfaces. This is a remarkable innovation to experience in person, as some of you did at the Outdoor Retailer Show.
Our global exposure for this breakthrough technology, which will originally be incorporated in our Merrell, Saucony, Sperry, Wolverine, Cat and Hush Puppies brands for this fall, delivers a meaningful competitive advantage for clearly differentiated product. Merrell and our other brands will bring this technology to consumers through aggressive go-to market strategies including significant retail partnerships to create an extensive point of sale presence.
Merrell will also be the first-ever presenting sponsor of Tough Mudder, the leading outdoor obstacle challenge which has been run by over 2 million participants around the world.
Our second largest brand, Sperry, is focused on moving beyond its franchise boat shoe category where it remains dominant to develop as a global lifestyle brand. Although the boat shoe category slowed this past year due to a shift towards more athletic-inspired silhouettes, the Sperry non-boat shoe styles grew nearly 20% and now account for nearly half of the total business.
The Saltwater Duck Boot collection was a fantastic success in Q4 and propelled Sperry to the number two rank in the rain boot category according to NPD. The Saltwater was the number one boot in the United States for this fall.
The Sperry boot program will be greatly expanded for fall 2016 and there's been an incredible early response from retailers to the broader program. The brand will also introduce the new Paul Sperry collection this year, a modern and innovative collection to connect with our younger consumer and capitalize on the athleisure trend. And I'm excited about the great new product in the Sperry pipeline and encouraged by what I'm hearing in the marketplace, especially from our consumers.

Saucony, our third largest brand remains intensely focused on product innovation. The brand has grown over the past several years with a steady introduction of cutting-edge technologies. Saucony launched the EVERUN cushioning and energy return technology in late 2015 and plans to expand this award-winning innovation across the product line in 2016. In fact, the first three styles from Saucony with EVERUN won – all of them won Editor's Choice Award from Runner's World.
Footwear styles incorporating the ISO-Fit technology introduced in late 2014 also continue to build. In addition, the brand will ramp up its Life On The Run collection with new product introductions, which we believe represents a significant growth opportunity in the athletic casual athleisure category.
Finally, the heritage-inspired Saucony Originals business which grew over 60% in 2015 will continue to move forward with fresh product designs, compelling storytelling and strategic distribution expansion.
Finally, I want to spend a minute providing you with an update on our omni-channel initiative and the strong growths we're seeing as a result of our efforts. eCommerce development across our portfolio continues to present a significant growth opportunity as we create a stronger bond with our consumers.
We strategically invested in 2015 and drove accelerated growth, outpacing the industry, especially in the last quarter of the year, with growth of nearly 25%. We will continue to invest in this fast growing profitable channel in 2016, focusing on a seamless omni-channel brand experience for the consumer, especially in mobile, which experienced growth of over 100% in 2015. The consumer and retail marketplace continue to evolve at a rapid pace. And we're excited and energized about the new opportunities ahead in this area.
Transitioning now to our expectations for the year ahead. I feel very good about where the company stands today and I'm excited about our efforts to take advantage of our many global opportunities. And to address the segments of the business that we're not meeting our expectations. I am, however, a little cautious about the year ahead as the visibility into 2016 is less clear than normal. Domestically, we expect the hangover from a tepid holiday retail season, coupled with high inventory lessons – or levels to have a meaningful impact on the first half of 2016.
The shift in consumer behavior is also continuing with consumers migrating to online channel and both consumers and retailers buying closer to need. Globally, some of the uncontrollable challenges currency issues, economic slowdown in some key countries, and geopolitical volatility are expected to continue and have become the new normal. While 2016 will present some challenges, we see the year ahead as real opportunity. We have a great brand portfolio, broad geographic reach, an exceptional operating platform and a talented and nimble team focused on the consumer and driving product innovation.
With respect to our 2016 outlook, we expect revenue to be impacted by over $100 million due to store closures, the Cushe exit and currency. We also expect currency to have around an $0.18 per share impact on EPS. Despite these headwinds, we expect our revenue and earnings to be about flat with 2015 at the top end of our current 2016 guidance range.
While visibility into the current year is a little more murky than usual, we do expect revenue and earnings to be stronger in the second half. As excess retail inventory clears and our largest brands introduce significant new product collections. For Merrell, growth in 2016 will be driven by the expanded product offerings in franchise collections, including Moab, Capra and All Out, which will be released this summer and fall as part of the brands go-to-market partnerships with key retailers.

The Arctic Grip program for Merrell and five of our other brands will roll out this fall. The first Merrell-sponsored Tough Mudder event will not happen until late March with over 50 events across seven countries scheduled for the rest of the year.
We expect Sperry to have a challenging first half given continued softness in boat shoes, with growth coming in the second half on the strength of its expanded boot and not boat product offerings. In 2015, Sperry grew non-boat shoe categories to nearly 50% of sales, and we expect this trend to continue.
Finally, Saucony should continue to generate growth throughout the year on the strength of its technology athleisure and Originals product offering. Mike Stornant will provide more details in a moment and we will, of course, provide additional insight and update as the year progresses.
Looking ahead, we are focused on our consumers and on delivering outstanding product innovation. Our business model has been a differentiator and earnings generator during times of change and it's allowed us to consistently invest in our strategic priorities, while returning value to our shareholders. On that note, I want to sincerely thank our 6,000 Wolverine team members around the world for their hard work, dedication to the company, and most importantly, their passion for our brands and consumers.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide additional commentary on our 2015 result as well as provide guidance for 2016. Mike?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Thanks, Blake. And thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. During his prepared remarks, Blake provided meaningful insight regarding our 2015 fourth quarter and full year results. I would like to add that I'm extremely pleased with our performance during a volatile time. After a very strong start to the year, in mid-September we foreshadowed the current environment and the company responded quickly to the challenge. We acted early, swiftly and with a strong sense of urgency, all consistent with Wolverine's culture and core values. As a result, our early actions allowed us to overcome tough conditions and we are now well-positioned to navigate the uncertain global landscape in front of us.
Let me review the specifics of the company's fourth quarter performance followed by greater detail on full year results. The company's earnings performance was strong relative to a challenging retail environment as global economic pressures worsened, holiday sales proved tepid, and the unseasonably warm weather persisted in certain regions. We proactively managed the business to deliver earnings growth and strong cash flow in the quarter.
Adjusted Q4 earnings per share of $0.33 were in line with our guidance, representing a 10% increase over the prior year's $0.30. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share were $0.40, representing significant growth of 33% versus the prior year. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $0.12, compared to $0.10.
Fourth quarter reported revenue of $751.2 million was in line with our guidance. Underlying revenue declined 2.9% versus the prior year and reported revenue was down 7.1%. Our diversified brand portfolio helped mitigate risk in the quarter, led by exceptional double-digit growth from our third largest brand, Saucony. This performance included double-digit constant currency growth in all geographic regions, fueled by continued product innovation including EVERUN and new Originals offerings.
Chaco continued its positive momentum and contributed strong low-teens growth in the quarter and full year growth of just over 50%. The Chaco business continues to generate great momentum. The Stride Rite wholesale business performed well in Q4, growing strong double-digits and benefiting from the new Surprize by Stride Rite Program recently introduced at Target.

The Sperry brand exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Down low single-digits against strong high-single-digit growth last year. Sperry experienced very healthy triple-digit growth in boots, specifically the trend-right Saltwater Duck Boot collection, offset by projected lower boat shoe sales.
Merrell's Q4 constant currency revenue was down low-single digit, due mostly to softness in the cold weather performance boot category, offset by improvements in the active lifestyle category. Entering Q4, we anticipated a variety of headwinds, including troubling macroeconomic factors for some of our key international markets.
However, the pervasive warm weather in certain regions of the U.S. and other international markets presented an additional challenge for a few of our brands with significant cold weather product offerings particularly boots.
Merrell, Cat, and Wolverine experienced some softness in the quarter due to weather. Our work boot brands were also impacted by high unemployment in the oil and construction sectors and soft economic conditions in key international markets, especially Russia.
Fourth quarter constant currency revenue was down high-single digits for Wolverine brand and down high-teens for Cat, as a result of the challenging macroeconomic conditions mentioned above. eCommerce is strategic priority for the company was a bright spot in Q4 and grew almost 25%, including strong double-digit growth from our three largest brands, Merrell, Sperry, and Saucony. Mobile grew triple-digits in Q4.
As planned, we continued to close underperforming stores during the quarter. In addition, new leadership and operational improvements resulted in a much better year-over-year comparative store sales trend in Q4, which was up over 500 basis points relative to the first three quarters of the year. Full-year reported revenue of $2.69 billion was in line with our guidance and represents underlying growth of 2.1%. On a reported basis, revenue was down 2.5%.
Full-year adjusted gross margin on a constant currency basis was 39.7%, compared to 39.4% in the prior year, as a result of proactive strategic price increases early in the year and effective management of product costs. Reported gross margin was 39.1%.
For 2015, adjusted operating margin on a constant currency basis was 9.4%, compared to 9.9% last year. Higher pension expense and planned incremental brand investments accounted for approximately 150 basis points of deleverage. Discipline over the remaining operating expenses resulted in approximately 100 basis points of improvement.
Fiscal 2015 adjusted operating margin was 8.9% and reported operating margin was 7.5%. Net interest expense for the year was approximately $38.2 million, $7.2 million lower than the prior year, reflecting an $80.9 million reduction in debt principal, including $58 million of prepayments.
The full-year adjusted effective tax rate was 27%, compared to 26.2% in the prior year and our reported tax rate was 25.2%. Full-year adjusted earnings per share were $1.45, including a negative $0.13 per share impact from currency, compared to $1.62 in the prior year. On a reported basis, earnings per share were $1.20, compared to $1.30 in the prior year. During 2015, the company generated $165.5 million in free cash flow and maintained a strong balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $194.1 million and net debt of $625.9 million, down $51 million since year-end 2014 and down nearly $550 million since the acquisition of PLG in 2012.
As of year-end, our leverage ratio was 2.28 times, compared to 4 times at the closing of the PLG acquisition. Adjusted EBITDA was $334.5 million for the year. To return value to our shareholders, we repurchased $92.6 million in common stock during 2015, leaving $107 million of our share buyback authorization available as we entered 2016. We also paid out $24.4 million in dividends to our shareholders during fiscal 2015.

Net working capital was $660.5 million, down 5.8% versus the prior year. Accounts receivable improved by $13.8 million, while inventories increased 12.7% or $52.6 million. Ending inventory was approximately $15 million higher than expected due to lower Q4 boot sales and the soft retail environment. Nearly all of that excess is comprised of core boot and other carryover styles. The quality of our inventory remains very high, with closeout and aged inventory at relatively low levels. We will continue to work through our inventory in a rational manner over the coming months and expect to reach normalized levels during the second half of 2016.
Overall, our priorities for cash are as follows: drive organic growth, primarily through investments in product innovation, omni-channel growth and demand creation, return value to shareholders through share repurchases and consistent dividends, pay down our debt and pursue potential value-enhancing acquisitions.
Before moving to our discussion on 2016 and related guidance, I want to provide an update on the company's strategic realignment plan, which is primarily focused on addressing stores that are underperforming in today's difficult retail environment. This plan was initiated in 2014 and updated most recently during our Q3 2015 earnings call.
We have closed 104 stores through 2015 and plan to close approximately 100 stores in 2016, including 60 at normal lease expiration. In addition to store closures, we've restructured our DTC organization resulting in a more efficient, lower cost infrastructure appropriate for the size and complexity of our fleet.
The strategic realignment plan was focused mainly on addressing our underperforming Stride Rite stores. During the fourth quarter, we recognized non-cash fixed asset impairment charges of $11.5 million related to the projected performance of stores that will close in the future. And a trade name impairment of $2.5 million for Stride Rite.
Now, I would like to transition to our 2016 revenue and earnings guidance. We believe that the soft consumer demand and challenging retail environment experienced in the fourth quarter of 2015 will continue into the New Year, both domestically and in key international regions. Limited visibility into the back half of 2016 is contributing to a higher level of uncertainty and conservatism for many of our global customers and distributors. As a result, we are taking a cautious position regarding our 2016 guidance.
While our current view may ultimately prove to be somewhat conservative, a number of unusual factors are impacting our outlook, including higher than normal inventory levels at retail resulting in limited open-to-buy until seasonal goods are liquidated, currency headwinds from a persistently strong U.S. dollar which have resulted in higher product costs in most international markets, financial instability for some of our domestic retailers and global customers, ongoing softness in global demand as evidenced by persistent downward pressure on commodity prices and a slowdown in China's economy, and strong trends in eCommerce growth which have put pressure on traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.
Revenue in 2016 will be negatively impacted by approximately $100 million due to FX translation, store closures and the exit of the Cushe business. With this in mind, we expect 2016 reported revenue in the range of $2.475 billion to $2.575 billion, a decline in the range of approximately 4.3% to 8%, and 2016 underlying revenue to be almost flat with 2015 at the high-end of our range.
Gross margin is expected to benefit from the price increases implemented midway through 2015 and lower product costs in the second half of 2016 offset by approximately 90 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. As a result, gross margin is expected to be flat to slightly down in 2016.

We expect flat to slightly lower adjusted operating margin versus the prior year despite strong currency headwinds and slightly lower underlying revenue. Operating margin will benefit from our ongoing strategic realignment plan and other reorganization activities executed earlier this year, along with meaningfully lower pension expense. We remain committed to our multi-year investment plan, focused on delivering future growth through demand creation, our omni-channel eCommerce business, consumer insights and product innovation capabilities.
We expect 2016 net interest and other expenses of approximately $35 million to $38 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 28% and diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 97.5 million shares. As a result of these inputs, full-year fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected in the range of $1.30 to $1.40, which includes the negative impact from foreign exchange of approximately $0.18 per share.
On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.48 to $1.58, growth of 2% to 8.9%. Additional store closures and other H1 non-recurring restructuring costs of about $16 million, or approximately $0.10 per share, results in expected reported earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.30.
We are forecasting full-year depreciation and amortization of approximately $46 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $280 million to $305 million. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $65 million to $70 million, primarily for investments in omni-channel initiatives, information technology and distribution center and other facility enhancements.
Focusing on Q1 2016, we expect reported revenue to decline in the range of approximately 9% to 11% and Q1 underlying revenue to decline in the range of approximately 6% to 8%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter are expected in the range of $0.21 to $0.24, reflecting lower revenue, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately $0.06 and the earlier phasing of incremental brand investments compared to last year. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.27 to $0.30. Reported earnings per share are expected in the range of $0.12 to $0.15.
During 2016, we will focus on those things that we can control and adjust to the current conditions, which we consider to be the new normal. In this environment, we plan to continue our incremental investment strategy, focusing on our product innovation engine, consumer insights, the critical starting point for all of our initiatives and decisions as a company, the organic growth of our brands, particularly Merrell, eCommerce and mobile infrastructure and apparel and accessories opportunities.
Let me simply conclude by saying that, despite a cautious outlook for 2016, we will continue to be diligent and deliberate as we manage the business in a proactive manner. Most importantly, we continue to invest behind initiatives and capabilities that will drive future growth.
Thanks for your time this morning. We will now turn the call back over to the operator. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could speak a little bit more just about the inventory overhang that you reference in the fourth quarter. Just how much of that was boots and colder weather product? And then how does that affect your visibility as you think about the fall 2016 order book thus far?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Erinn, I assume you're talking about retail inventory in general?

Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Yeah. Exactly, in general.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Okay. I really recently read some articles and retail inventory, at least here domestically, is at a 19-month high compared to sales. So it's one indication of where in general consumer soft goods and hard goods stand. And someone else estimated that current inventory is about 15% higher than last year's. So we've been fortunate here in the United States to have received some weather finally in January and February and that's helping to clear out some of the seasonal inventory.
I've heard a few reports about a few retailers packing and holding some carryover stock, whether it's outerwear or boots. But there certainly is an overhang right now and, frankly, as we view the retail environment, it's going to take at least two quarters maybe into the third quarter to clear most of these goods and get down to a normal level.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. I guess, Blake, as you guys are talking to your partners within the retail community, how are you seeing that order book shape up for you guys thus far for fall if you were to parse out what you're hearing from some of your majors versus some of your independents?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, most of the retail community recoiled a bit from the very tough holiday season. And so orders have been very stingy, very hard to get future orders in general. For us, we have seen some sharp light in a couple areas, the Sperry boot program, Arctic Grip and some other initiatives that we have for fall. So we do see retailers stepping to the plate when they see some really fresh, innovative product. But it's going to be a while here as we recover from in general high inventory levels.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. And then, Mike, for you, just a clarification on the guidance as you think about the first quarter in context to the balance of the year. When you talked about revenue being down 9% to 11% on a reported basis, how much of that is from foreclosures versus FX as you're starting the year here versus just tepid sales quarter-to-date? Just help us think about that revenue decline.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah, we talked about the difference between reported and underlying growth, it's about 2%, it has a 2% headwind, both currency and those store closures combined. The Cushe business, not a big impact in the first quarter. But I think the other factor which you're speaking to is the overhang on inventory and so just at retail.
So what we're seeing right now is that kind of trend improving in the last three quarters of the year. But for Q1, we'll probably take the biggest decline in terms of revenue percentage against any of the other quarters in the year. So, we think that that overhang in inventory, we're starting to see some spark in at-once activities for some of our boot business, for instance once we saw some cold weather, but we're certainly not planning on that to continue dramatically. So, right now that's the sort of the headwind ahead of us.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
And then, I guess, just last is related to the EPS guidance that you gave for the first quarter. Can you just balance out how you're thinking about the expense structure that's here? I think you guys have a pretty hefty marketing spend behind Merrell and I believe that's first-half weighted. So, should that...
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Okay.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
I mean, is that first quarter weighted in particular? Or should we continue to anticipate some pressure, at least relative to the top line on the second quarter as well, when you think about that spend?

Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. I think the spend is, certainly, first-half weighted for the investments there. We're activating some of the go-to market programs in March, but a lot of that money, obviously, spent earlier in the quarter and will continue to be spent in the second quarter. So, we are seeing some front weighting of that in the way the quarters are phasing out.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Got it. All right. Thank you. Best of luck. I'll let someone else hop in.

Our next question comes from Jessica Schmidt of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks for taking my question. So, I know that you made some changes, organizational changes this quarter to kind of consolidate initiatives in apparel and accessories, but just given challenges that you've had there, would you consider licensing these businesses out on soft brands or would you ever look to make an acquisition that might build up some competencies in these categories?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think frankly, we would consider the right strategic tuck-in acquisition in that area. You have to remember, we've licensed these areas maybe predominantly for our Hush Puppies brands since 1959 in a number of countries, different countries around the world, especially a number of programs in Asia-Pacific. So, it's something we're certainly used to.
It's just a critical strategic initiative for us as we look ahead to developing global head-to-toe lifestyle brand. So, we do have no leadership. Some years ago, these efforts used to be consolidated under a single solid line reporting relationship in the company and frankly, we've moved back to that structure to be more effective and efficient.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. And then I guess just quickly, how much of the $18 million in the Cushe business were you able to recapture under Merrell?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
It's hard to really estimate at the present time. We will get some of that under Merrell, but I don't know today if it's a third, if it's 50%. It would probably be something in that range.
Jessica L. Schmidt - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. I'll pass it along. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Hope you guys are (47:16).
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jim.
Christopher E. Hufnagel - VP-Strategy, Communications & Investor Relations
Hi, Jim.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
So, my question is around SG&A and the restructuring specifics. Just looking through the outlook, the guidance seems to imply a reduction in SG&A that goes beyond the savings from restructuring. I know a year ago you talked about the $100 million investment behind the brands, you've mentioned some planned investment in consumer insights and innovation. I guess, I'm just wondering where you're finding savings in the ongoing business to show leverage and afford these additional investments even with down volumes.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. I mean, Jim, we've been working really hard on that in the last quarter or so. And we've, obviously, made some great headwind in restructuring our D to C group and getting more leverage on the store operation side of the business. So, we're going to see some benefits in 2016 and beyond for that. We've made some other organizational changes, too, not quite as dramatic but in the first quarter, you'll see a little bit of additional kind of nonrecurring restructuring costs related to some other changes we made in the organization, leaning up the group and just positioning ourselves for the tough road ahead a little bit.

We've also got some benefit from pension expense this year. And that's going to be a tailwind for us for a change. So, those are some of the main drivers. I think from the standpoint of just being able to maintain our operating margin, it's really important to realize that we've done a lot in the last year, really combat the FX headwinds that we're dealing with.
So, those product cost improvements, the cost engineering there and some of the benefits we're seeing from the lower input costs in the latter half of the year, price increases that we took, tough decisions we made last year to increase prices, those are all starting to pay dividends for us as we're able to maintain our gross margin in a pretty tough environment. So, I think, just being proactive and working through the organization for efficiency opportunities is pulling us in a position to maintain our operating margin at a flat level.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, Mike, can I ask you to provide some more detail around the restructuring expenses. How soon do you expect to be able to get out of some of these leases?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Can you break up cash versus non-cash components of that?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And then talk about how that all rolls up to cash flow objectives for the year.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. For sure. I mean, we talked about another $16 million or so of expense in the first two quarters. Most of that is going to be cash related. And it's primarily going to be related to our store closures. Most of those will be done by the end of the first quarter. There's a little bit of hangover into Q2, but not much though. It's $16 million, say $15 million of that, maybe a little less than $15 million of that is cash and really driving the further improvements that we're talking about in terms of getting out of some stores. And we've already incurred some those costs in Q1, as we talked about related to some of the organizational changes that we made. So, not a lot of additional sort of restructuring exposure in the back half of the year that will be done, certainly, by midway through the year and most of it will be behind us by the end of Q1.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And then do you have cash flow objective for the year you can share?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Free cash flow, probably in the range of $180 million to $190 million.
Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sure.

Our next question comes from Taposh Bari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good morning, it's Chad on for Taposh. My first question is on the new brand operating group structure. Can you just help – tell us how the change in structure better positions your core brands for accelerated growth?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We don't do this slightly obviously. We've done it every several to five or six years historically as we've added or pruned brands from the portfolio, but this is something that we gave a lot of thought to and it developed over time. There's a number of – basically, we wanted to put the right brands with the right leaders. So, last year we had elevated Richie Woodworth to Group President and it makes sense, given the location, for example of Saucony in Boston to report to Richie. It's a brand that he ran for almost nine years, the growth there has been pretty spectacular and it just made a lot of sense. So, we grouped Saucony under Richie.

And then, with respect to James Zwiers, who most recently had been running our international group, we grouped all of our brands with probably the most international penetration under Jim. So, when you look at Merrell, Hush Puppies, Cat, Sebago, those are all brands that have a substantial portion of their pairs offshore. And Jim was coming over from directly running our International Group. As you know, Jim has been 18 years at the company and hasn't quite held every job there is at the company, but it's getting close.
And then under Ted Gedra for the Heritage group, we grouped our four core boot brands that are largely focused on the U.S. market and have a lot in common when it comes to consumers and to our retail customer. So, that's basically the logic behind the new group structure. We're going to be providing in a few weeks here to the investment community detailed historical sales data and stuff to help guide you throughout 2016 and beyond.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, one follow-up just on Stride Rite. Can you help us – help to sort of size how big that business is today, what this mix is between wholesale and retail, how many stores there are versus how many there were at the peak? Just any parameters you're willing to give us on that business would be really helpful. Thanks.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'm just kind of quickly looking here. So, Stride Rite today would have about 220 stores to 230 stores as it stands today. The vast majority of the closures in 2014 and 2015 were Stride Rite stores, although there were some other stores in our fleet that were also closed. So, Stride Rite today is about 220 stores. Very profitable eCommerce business and very profitable wholesale business. The wholesale business would be in the $140 million to $150 million range just to give you some idea.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you. And then, how big is the retail business?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
In dollars?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
About the same. A little bit bigger. It's about 50% retail, 50% wholesale.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jay Sole of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning. I was just wondering if you can dig into the sales guidance a little bit for next year within the different groups, the Performance Group, Lifestyle and Heritage. Can you tell us what you see in some of the growth rates for the different brands being, Sperry, Merrell, Saucony? Could you – anything you can share with us on that regard would be helpful. Thank you.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We really don't go down that alley for a bunch of good reasons, and probably this year for even better reasons, given the probably the lack of clarity on what's going to happen here and a little bit in the first half but especially, in the back half of the year.
So, across the board, we're pulling all levers to drive growth this year. Orders have been, frankly, pretty – future orders, pretty stingy to this point in time, which is completely understandable, given the retail situation with respect to inventory. So, we'll certainly give you some in a couple of weeks here, some historical revenue parameters on the new operating group structure.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Maybe a different question, maybe about sales. It sounds like there's two different themes here. On one hand, weather obviously impacted the boot business with Cat and Wolverine, but, at the same time, you are talking about macro, you mentioned China and different things that are continuing into 2016. So can you help us to segregate like what's really going on? How much is weather? How much is macro? Because it's not quite clear what the most important drivers are?

Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, I – well listen, I was – first of all, I was proud that I think I got through my script without saying the word weather, which drives me crazy, but anyways, so, it was obviously a factor in setting that aside.
Internationally, it's a little bit of an unusual time. The slowdown we're seeing, my personal view is that low commodity prices generally don't lead countries or regions to greater growth.
They're really a reflection of lower consumer demand. It can be lower consumer demand for soft goods or hard goods. You've got geopolitical risks in some countries, and some countries are suffering. Russia, millions of refugees pouring into Europe. This is all having an impact on business. And then you've got the internationally, the very strong U.S. dollar. I think the pound in just two days this week fell to an eight or a nine year low against the dollar, for example.
So, you're seeing these kind of wild swings in currency. Most of the world, virtually all of the world buys its footwear in the U.S. dollars and sells on local currency. So, you can imagine a little bit of a disruption that can happen when the U.S. dollar strengthens 20%, 25%, 30% over a period of only two years.
So, what's interesting right now from my viewpoint is internationally there are number of factors going on. Some of them are related, frankly some of them are not related. China, for example, where our business is relatively small compared to our total continues to grow at meaningful level. Is China going to have a hard landing or is China going to have a soft landing here as they migrate from a manufacturing export mindset in economy to an internally driven consumer consumption economy.
Those are some big issues, certainly, above my pay grade. We're just positioning our business to adjust to all possibilities as we look ahead here.
Domestically here...
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, domestically in the United States, we have this slow burn recovery. So, it's not bad, but it's not great. On the other hand, the good news for us in the footwear industry is if you're there with fresh, innovative product, if you're there with the right product, Saucony EVERUN, Merrell Capra, Sperry Saltwater Duck Boots, you can win. So, that's the good news for us that we got a lot chances to win in just about any environment. But it is frankly a bit unusual at the present time. I've been talking about this internally now for well over a year.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
If I could just ask you one more.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
You talked about your omni-channel, how are you defining omni-channel right now? I mean, is it going to be a big store build-out plus eCommerce? Is going to be for all brands? Just certain brands? What is the vision that you have for the company to make it the omni-channel, given the omni-channel capabilities it needs?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I always go back to the consumer. So, what does the consumer want? The consumer wants their brand to be there on a consistent basis, whether they're on their mobile, whether they're in a store and they see something they wanted delivered to the house, whether they're on their computer, wherever the consumer wants to interact with the brand, that's frankly how I kind of view omni-channel. Hence, especially over the last year, we've spent a lot of money on platform, systems, talents, and other resources to really stay on a parallel course with our consumer.
We don't really see those – the consumer, clearly, is voting with their checkbook towards online. I think in general in the U.S. in the holiday season, online was up about 13%, we were up about double of that for our own brands.

On the other hand, what's also interesting is retailers that started off as pure online brands are now finding a great need for stores. Everybody realizes today that the consumer will spend more money in a store, and they still spend more in a store. And, frankly, the consumer still enjoys that touch, feel, try-it-on experience. So, omni-channel really involves stores, online certainly, and then, of course, your work with your good wholesale customers.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks, Blake.

Our next question comes from Steve Marotta of C.L. King & Associates. Please go ahead.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, Blake and Mike. I understand your reticence on commenting at specific brand sales expectations for 2016. Historically, however, you've given them for the near term. At least, could you please speak to Merrell and Sperry sales expectations in the first quarter?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, yeah. We expect frankly Sperry to be down at a pretty good clip in the first half from what we see today. Boat shoes continued to be soft, maybe a little bit more – a little bit softer in men's interestingly than on the women's side of the business but still, trending down. Sperry is introducing some athletic casual, athleisure silhouettes. Certainly, for Sperry, we're not seeing any push-back from retailers or the consumers to category extensions. I guess the duck boot, the Saltwater Duck Boot, would be a good example of that. So, for us, it's just getting the Sperry product innovation engine ramped up quickly enough, never fast enough for me, to counter the falloff in boat shoes.
With respect to Merrell, Merrell should have a bit more of a level year probably down a little bit here in the first half, but a lot of their initiatives around strategic partnerships with group retailers on Capra, All Out, Moab, and the introduction of Arctic Grip and really also the Tough Mudder affiliation, which will really get ramped up here late spring into the summer and next fall. A lot of those initiatives are really in midyear or beyond for the Merrell brand. So, maybe I would like it to be a little more balance, but it is what it is and we certainly like the initiatives going forward.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Thank you. That's helpful. Lastly, what is eCommerce in the aggregate as a percent to your consolidated sales?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
5% or so.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Okay. And then...
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Too low.
Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Right. And if you include DTC in that, overall, what would the percentage be?

Our next question comes from Corinna Van der Ghinst of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on the inventory discussion you gave some good color on caution in the marketplace. Did you guys actually take back any product from wholesale accounts? And are you going to clear that through your own retail stores or off-price throughout the year? And just then how are you strategizing your production for the year? Are you anticipating a higher level of at-once versus initial preorders this year and how are you kind of planning your ability to chase if the season ends up better than expected this fall?

Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
There's a lot of questions there. Let me see if I can tackle a few of them and Mike can tackle the rest. I guess with respect to inventory, I don't believe we took back any inventory. Maybe we took back 10 pairs or 20 pairs here and there, I don't know. But we really did not take back any inventory. As the fall season and holiday progressed, we work pretty closely with our retailers to make sure they weren't stuffed. And that they had the right balance of inventory, our inventory on their shelves.
With respect to our mix, I know a lot of our peers have reported inventory levels substantially greater than ours. And our 12.7% probably is 3% higher than our original expectations going into the fall. But for us, it's virtually all core products, certainly core product we're not going to dump in the closeout channel. For our inventory, our closeouts compared to last year are down about a third and our aged inventory is down about 25%, just to give you some frame of that.
So the first half of what we're seeing is a continuing pretty volatile environment when it comes to orders. And for at-once orders, we can have some weeks with great spikes for some of our brands and then we can be flat for some other weeks. I think it's just all an end result of retailers trying to deal with the situation they currently find themselves in. We see that normalizing here as the year rolls out, but it's going to be some up and down for the time being.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
The only thing I would emphasize there is the fact that we certainly work closely with all of our retail partners and our distributors. So as we were coming out of Q3 and heading into Q4, we wanted to make sure there wasn't a great deal of overhang of our inventory in the marketplace in the first half of this year.
And there's still more probably with certain retailers than they would like, but our ability to partner with them to make sure that we're not in a position to have to take a lot of returns back and the fact that our brands or the sell-throughs on many of our brands are kind of better than most even though the overall inventories with some of these retailers is a little bit high, those are all pretty good indications, another reason why we're not fearful of having to take significant markdowns in terms of liquidating the inventory that we have.
So we've been proactive managing our own inventories down. That's why we feel comfortable with where we're going to end the year with inventories, but also just managing closely with our retail partners as we navigated the last three months or four months.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could follow-up with one big-picture question. How are you guys think about the long-term algorithm of the portfolio now given the reorganization, some of the brands or the exits that you have made and the appetite for acquisitions? Are you still thinking about the top-line growth story as a high-single digit long-term outlook?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would say 2016 is going to be a year from a revenue growth perspective we're, frankly, not entirely happy with. We wish it was better, but we are realistic and we understand it's a pretty dynamic environment, especially when you have about 49% of your pairs sold outside the United States. So we're realists and we're dealing with all those kind of challenges.
We're happy with our portfolio right now. A few years ago, we would have touted 15 brands. So we've pruned our portfolio and are focused on growth initiatives really for all the existing brands that we still have in the portfolio. Certainly, when you look at a Keds or a Saucony or a Merrell or a Sperry, some of our bigger brands, a lot of growth potential left there, both in the lifestyle area as well as footwear.

Our next question comes from Christian Buss of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the accelerated capital expenditures in 2016 and also how you're thinking about share repurchases for the year.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sure. Well, the CapEx number that we shared in the prepared remarks reflects a couple big initiatives. One is, as you know, we're moving into a new office in the Boston area just down the road from our existing location, so there's some meaningful investment in that new space. I think we plan to move in sometime in June, so it's around the corner. That would be an unusual one-time impact on our normal CapEx. We typically spend between $40 million and $50 million a year on CapEx, so the numbers we're showing are elevated from that.
The other initiative which we're still working through negotiating but we have it in the guidance is an expansion of our distribution facilities and looking at some strategies around that outside of the current infrastructure that we have. We have a couple of leases that are expiring in a couple of older facilities. And so in an effort to look for some future cost savings and synergies, we're reevaluating our distribution footprint. So those are the two big drivers that would take us out of the normal CapEx levels.

That's helpful.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
I'm sorry (1:10:53). Yes, we're always in the market. We're looking for opportunistic buyback scenarios. And one of the things, again, as you would be aware of, our notes today carry financial covenants that put some restrictions on those share buybacks. And we made some meaningful repurchases late in 2015. We were able to do that because we built up the capacity over a period of time in ways the covenants worked to be able to do that.
And then that got reset and so we'll have to work through those covenants during the course of the year. We have some other options and we're looking at other ways to get amendments to those covenants. But in the meantime, we don't have any meaningful share repurchases embedded in our guidance.

Our next question comes from Benjamin Bray of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Benjamin Bray - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for taking our question. Can you provide some detail on the 25% eCommerce growth in Q4 specifically? What was driving that acceleration?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, frankly, a lot of work we've done over the prior year. We spent a lot of effort and time and resources this year putting as many brands as we could on a single platform, and that has been very efficient and very useful to help drive growth.
We added talent throughout the year in the digital social area for our brands. I think that was a great contributor to the growth as well. And then we're simply just paying more attention to it. It's an important growth opportunity for the company. Probably should be at least 10% of our overall sales and that's how we're viewing the opportunity. Obviously, a highly profitable opportunity.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
I would also add that we had some real wins in the fourth quarter from a product standpoint. And we mentioned earlier that our three biggest brand had over double – very strong double-digit growth in eComm in the fourth quarter.

So that very successful Sperry Saltwater Duck Boot was a big driver of success for their eComm business as well. So where we go out with exclusive product opportunities and/or early opportunities on our own sites, we're seeing success with that and we'll be continuing that strategy going forward.

Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz of B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yeah, thanks for taking my questions. So, two questions. One, just in terms of the guidance. So, you expect better performance in the back half than the first half, but you have said that visibility is limited and you've also said that you expect retailers to be pretty cautious with the pre-books. So does it really boil down to just an easier back-half comparison and you're expecting more of a normalized winter so better reorders than what you experienced in this past fourth quarter? Or is it something else? Does it kind of come back down to just new product launches? And I have a follow-up.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, Mitch, it's really all those things, really. It's some of the new product launches, a lot of which are really aimed at the fall selling season across our brand portfolio. It will be some easier compares certainly as we get into the fall next year. I've given up trying to predict weather. I think one of the reasons, frankly, the Saltwater Boot did so well for Sperry this year, it's a transition product. Is it a cold weather product, is it a hot? We sold the Saltwater Boot in August, September, October, November, December, until we were sold out to the pair. So it's a great example of a good fashion fit, but also a transition product. So all of our brands, like a lot of our competitors, are focused on transition product.
And then, listen, retailers have been, as you know, Mitch, for the last 10 years, trying to push more and more of the inventory risk back on to brand owners. So we're seeing that a little bit as we roll forward here. There's a lot that's going on that's changing in the retail marketplace and it all relates to changing consumer behavior. So we understand that, we're working with our retailers in that regard. But there's been a lot of pushback on the brands to be more important to retailers in maybe the at-once side of the business than future orders.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then on Sperry, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of the historical context on the boat business. I was hoping you could give us some color as to I think you said that like a little over half the business now, boat is, for Sperry.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Where is Sperry boat relative to peak? Is it down like 20%, 30% from peak? And also where is it from maybe six, seven, eight years ago prior to the big ramp on the boat shoe trend? Does it still well up from where it was back then before boat shoes ramped? I'm just trying to understand where it is.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, as you know, Mitch, this country, in particular, has always had an ebb-and-flow of boat shoe popularity. I would say starting seven, eight years ago, really Sperry almost singlehandedly increased the overall level. There's still volatility as we know in our comments reflected, but increased the overall floor for the boat shoe business especially in the U.S. market. So, today, the Sperry boat shoe business is still significantly bigger than it was seven, five, four years ago, three years ago.
Your other question really goes, where is bottom? It's always hard to judge. We're seeing some signs that once we get through the first half of this year that we may be approaching bottom for that business. Our efforts are focused on keeping boat fresh, keeping it relevant. It always going to be an incredible business and relevant silhouette in the United States market and making sure we maintain our dominant position of whatever that market is. Today Sperry has about 70% ownership of the boat shoe market and we're not giving up any of that high ground to anybody.

Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Got it. Right. Thanks. Good luck.

Our next question comes from Scott Krasik of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Yeah. Hi, everybody. Thanks.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Scott.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
So, I don't think you specifically answered it from way back ago, Mike. So, what – how much is FX a headwind, just the FX portion to 1Q sales and the full-year sales please?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
For the first quarter only?
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
For the first quarter and then the full year.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. For the first quarter only, it's about a 2% headwind...
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
...for the first quarter and for the full year, it's about the same.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. And then I'm assuming the gross margin is going to be down significantly on 1Q, but you're guiding...
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yes.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
...it to flat. So, can you talk about sort of what you're expecting or the environment to allow you to get back to a flat gross margin for the year, given the hole you're going to dig, please?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. Yeah. We talked a little bit about it too. So Q1 will be the biggest quarter. All of our FX earnings exposure is really in the gross margin line. So all these – it's the product cost related to new contracts that we've entered into in the last half of 2015. So $0.06 headwind in the first quarter is all product cost.
We don't get the full benefit of some of the product cost reductions until later in the year. So where we're seeing commodity price benefits and input cost benefits in our FOBs, those aren't going to show up until later in the year. We know what they are. We've ordered shoes against those prices, but we have some carryover there.
We're also being a little conservative on providing some provisions, some reserve, if you will, for any additional liquidation of the inventory that might pose an opportunity for us in the first quarter and second quarter. So, that puts some pressure on margin and would subside in the second half. So, it's really those factors and the timing of some of the benefits that we expect to see. FX will loosen up a little bit later in the year. And those product costs will start becoming a bigger tailwind for us as we move through the year.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay, perfect. And then just last, Blake, you mentioned that you have some product wins, right? Capra and Duck Boots and some of the Saucony product. So, I mean, really it just feels like you don't have enough good product to grow the business at this point. So you've been through Fannie and OR and Magic (1:20:29), what are the retailers telling you about the fall products? You obviously have some big platforms you're introducing. I mean, is that when you're going to start to see growth? Do you have the orders in hand? Can you talk about visibility?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, we certainly have the orders in hand for – or largely in hand for some of our key initiatives. So, our big partner retailers that have signed up with Merrell, for example, whether it's Capra, whether it's the expanded Moab line, we've got a lot of those orders in hand for that particular program. Obviously, everybody ran out of Sperry boots this past fall, so they know they need a good business. Sperry has shown that it's got a great line of transitional products which is great so.

But other than some of these points of light, I would say, retailers at this point in time still being pretty conservative. As you know it, you can never have enough product wins. We are focused on our consumer and product innovation. That's one of the reasons why we're creating a new innovation hub to help supplement the brand's creative efforts in that particular area. So, it's something we're keenly focused on. We know at the end of the day we're an industry where if the product is right, everything else matters, and if the product isn't right, sometimes, nothing else matters.
So, we're focused on it. We always wish we had a few more big stories. We've done a good job in 2015 of really filling the product pipeline, especially for Sperry, for example, in non-boat, and in Merrell as well, and across a number of brands for Arctic Grip. So fundamentally, it's going to be the focus on the consumer and product innovation that's going to drive organic growth.
We can't control currency, we can't control some of the geopolitical volatility and instability. We can't really control commodity prices. So, as in 2015, we're focused on the controllables, whether it's gross margin, enhancing gross margin. We haven't taken our foot off the pedal behind investing in our brands. So, we're investing in our brand as we had originally planned. And we're especially investing in product creation and innovation.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay. Good luck. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Chris Svezia of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.
Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back to some of the inventory for a moment. On your books, when it's up 12.7%. Could you just maybe just talk about what brands or categories have the heavy inventory? And what do you mean by it getting more in line as you go into the back half of the year? Are you still expecting it to be up? And how does that jive with, I guess, what seems to be high-single digit reported declines in revenue? Are you just meaningfully slowing down incoming receipts? Just how does that math work?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sure. Yes. I can walk you through it, Chris. I mean, first of all, it's – we talked a little bit in the remarks about boot inventory being a little higher than we would like. Part of that was a slowdown in the fourth quarter. Just in general, I mean, the oil industry and construction sector and some other areas have been hit pretty hard, and our work boot business softened up a little bit because of that and, obviously, the weather impacted boots across any of the brands that have cold weather product.
But we have core inventory that was purchased mid-year last year that came in really across the portfolio. And that's something we have to rationally work through over the course of the year. The good news is in September when we – late August and September when we saw some of the softness, we started to act pretty quickly with our factories on the core – orders of core merchandise that are generally at a pretty regular cadence in the way we buy it. And we slowed that way down. And so, we already have visibility to the inflow side of the equation.
We're going to see the inflow of inventories start to come down dramatically latter part of Q2 and Q3. We couldn't turn that off entirely and didn't really want to put that burden on our manufacturing partners. And so, we kind of managed through that over a reasonable period of time. So, we've got visibility to that. A meaningful reduction in inbound goods over the next couple of quarters.

Core inventory that we don't see necessarily as seasonal even though, like Blake said, we have about 3% more at the end of the year than maybe we wanted to, based on some of the more seasonal cold weather stuff. But other than that, it's core products that'll sell-through, not necessarily waiting until fall for to liquidate.
And then, at the end of the day, we're working closely with all of our retail customers on our projections there. So, when we talk about where we think we're going to end up at the end of the year, it would be down meaningfully from where we ended this year. And we're going to just make steady progress every quarter towards that. We'll probably see, again Q1 guidance what it is. We won't see an improvement in our inventory at the end of the first quarter. But after Q1 and certainly a meaningful reduction year-over-year relatively speaking, by Q2, and then even better performance into the latter part of the year. So, it's something we have pretty good visibility to and high level of confidence that we can achieve it.
Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. Thank you. And then just I have a question on pricing. In the past you have talked about the ability to try to push through some pricing.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah.
Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
As you sit here today, given the dynamics in the world we're in, and I think last call you referenced you had some challenges on pricing in certain categories. How do we think about it for this year?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I would say really how our brands approached this especially internationally as your – as carryover product goes from price that good but it goes to better, and your better inventory and styles go from better to best. It's incumbent upon your brands to come back with appropriate pricing of product in that – at that good category level.
So, a good-better-best scenario, a lot of our efforts from some of our brands, especially those brands with the big international businesses is focused on bringing out great product at the good price point level. And obviously, over the last several years, we've usually been ahead of this game. We've been very proactive when it comes to pricing. We like to increase our gross margins and our operating margins every year in most years. That's our focus. You can't do that if you don't price appropriately. It doesn't mean that you'd take a blanket increase across the whole product line for a particular brand. You have to be smart about it.
And I would say for some of our brands, our more traditional boot brands in the work area, it's a little bit tougher because they have a lot of product that is carryover product. And some of those styles have been around for two years, three years, more than five years. So, yeah, it's not an exact science but it just – it's something you have to work on every week and you've got to get on in front of it.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
And, Chris, we took that tough action last year, early in the year. And even with Sperry and their domestic business, they raised prices. And ultimately the consumer and the retailers out there frankly responded well to that. So, we don't have any meaningful or large scale increases planned for this year, there'll be some surgical increases where needed. But, overall, the benefit we're getting to margin is really a result of just getting the full year benefit from some of the work that we did last year.
Christopher Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. Understood. Thank you very much and all the best.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP

Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the CapEx guide. How much of the 2016 CapEx should we anticipate for the new innovation and design center called out in the prepared remarks? Or is that something we should consider for 2017?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
There'll be some investment there, more in 2017. But luckily, we've got some facilities and capacity in our current footprint to take advantage of this year and as we build that hub up. And so, it'll become a more prominent investment beyond 2016. But there's a meaningful investment in 2016 as well.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. Great. And then in the prepared remarks, there was a lot of discussion about potential acquisitions. On the flip side, would you consider divesting a brand or a segment in order to improve profitability or to reallocate capital in order to fund future growth?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, as you know, we've got a great history when it comes to capital generate – or cash generation and increasing EBITDA. So, we've never lack, fortunately, for funds or resources to organically grow our brand or do acquisitions. So, that wouldn't really come into our thinking. Our thinking about our brands over the year and we routinely take a look at our portfolio. And as you know, years ago when I was COO we got out of three businesses and we've exited a business or a brand from time to time when it didn't make sense or meet our future growth or earnings parameters.
We're pretty happy with the portfolio we have today. We have no plans to divest of any of our brands currently in our portfolio today. We also have today, because of our fantastic performance over the last three years and our current leverage ratio, we have the ability to do more acquisitions. We're primarily focused on organic growth today, but Mike and I and the team here do spend an appropriate amount of time looking at potential opportunities.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay. Great. Thank you very much and best of luck.

Our next question comes from Sam Poser of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The difference between the adjusted number and the reported number is the store closing costs. Can you break that out by quarter for us?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
For which year, Sam?
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
In your guidance.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
It's almost all in the first quarter.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
So, your net...
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Does that...
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
So your net earnings in the first quarter when you exclude that is $0.19, is that the correct number, or when you include that? Just trying to get that guidance that you gave for Q1.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
The guidance we gave of $0.21 to $0.24 excludes that number.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. Thanks. And then there's a $4.6 million benefit you have in the quarter interest income or other income. Can you tell us what that is?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
In Q4?
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Yeah. In Q4.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP

Yeah. We had a settlement on an outstanding legal issue that came through in Q4. Obviously, that's something that won't recur next year, so it's sort of a one-time benefit for us.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. So, it should – so, on a net-net, that should be taken out of the books?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. It's already reflected. Yeah. When I provided the guidance on our net interest expense and other expenses, that's reflected in that number.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. And then, I mean, so it looks like in the guidance, since you've done the PLG acquisition, your sales based on the sort of midpoint of your guidance are going to be up about 80% since 2011. And the earnings number is going to be almost flat. So, I'm just trying to – I'm trying to – I just want to understand sort of like when is this – when are we going to get cranking here?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't have those historical numbers in front of me, Sam. But, obviously, the PLG acquisitions added, even today with the Stride Rite stores underperforming, has added well over $100 million on an annual basis of EBITDA. Those brands were not performing at the level of historical Wolverine brands when we bought them. They were largely focused on the U.S.A. market. They didn't have really any higher – a great deal of higher margin international business.
So, for us, I think it's – we're seeing some growth in some of the brands. The overall success of those brands has been hurt by the Stride Rite stores. We've addressed that over the last 12 months and into this month.
When you take a look at the international penetration, just as an example, the Sperry brand in pairs grew 15% internationally last year. The Saucony brand grew 25%. The Keds brand, which has been a bit of pleasant surprise to me, grew about over 170% last year. So, we're finally getting some traction. It takes a while, as I've said before, with some of these brands. But we're finally getting some meaningful traction on the international front despite some of the macro challenges that we talked about earlier.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sam, it's important to remember just between 2015 and 2016, now with the new guidance that we've given you, $0.31 of currency impact to results. So, just to put that in perspective.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. So, that entire – I just want to clear. I just want to make sure I get this. The adjusted $1.30 to $1.40, that number takes out the currency but doesn't include that one-time -
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
That's reported results excluding the $16 million of restructuring that we talked about. That's going to be mostly in Q1 and partially into Q2. So that's our normal adjusted earnings per share. It's not currency neutral or anything else.
Sam Poser - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much for taking the questions.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
You're welcome, Sam.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP

Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter results highlighted by solid earnings in line with our original guidance. This performance is reflective of the high and consistent quality of our earnings engine, the power of our diversified brand portfolio, and the disciplined manner with which we operate our business.In spite of the current global retail environment, which continues to be choppy, our consolidated business and two of our three brand operating groups generated adjusted revenue growth during the quarter, excluding the impact of currency, the Patagonia Footwear exit and store closures as applicable.Mike and I will refer to adjusted revenue in this context in our remarks. But we'll also provide corresponding reported revenue figures. In step with our previously announced demand creation investment strategy, our quarterly marketing investment increased approximately 26% to support the long-term health and vitality of our brands. We remain committed to investing behind our brands and plan to accelerate revenue growth through product innovation, and deeper and more insightful consumer connections, all supported by a strong operational platform and our extensive global distribution footprint.For today's call, I'll cover our consolidated and brand operating group results, speak to some of the headwinds in the global marketplace, and then focus on key brand performances and related strategic updates for the quarter, specifically, the Stride Rite, Sperry and Merrell brands.Beginning with consolidated results. Adjusted revenue grew 0.7% versus the prior year, and reported revenue was $676.9 million (sic) [$678.9 million] (4:16), a 4.5% decrease year-over-year. We delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.48 for the quarter, in line with our original guidance and achieved strong gross margins across the portfolio, while effectively managing discretionary SG&A, which was only partially offset by the increased marketing investments behind our brand.Focusing in on the brand operating group performance, starting with the Performance Group. Adjusted revenue grew 3.8% with Chaco posting exceptionally strong double-digit growth, Merrell generating low single-digit growth, and Saucony contributing mid-single digit growth in the quarter.Adjusted revenue for the Lifestyle Group was down 5.1% with Sperry down less than 1%, Keds down low single digits, and Stride Rite down high single digits. Hush Puppies saw a constant currency low-teens decline, due primarily to our decision to realign our domestic distribution strategy. The brand's international licensee business remains strong with revenue up double digits.Concluding with the Heritage Group, adjusted revenue grew 2.9% with Cat delivering mid-single digit growth, Wolverine producing low single digit growth, HYTEST growing at a solid double-digit pace, Bates down less than 1%, and Harley-Davidson down high-single digit. Mike will provide additional detail regarding our financial results in a few minutes.So, now let me share our perspective on the global macroeconomic environment, which impacted our results in the third quarter and is expected to continue into the near future. Heading into the back half of the year, we identified and planned for a variety of global macroeconomic challenges, many of which persisted and some of which became more challenging relative to our prior expectations.Although many of our key global markets have performed well, a number of others are exhibiting some stress for a variety of different reasons. In many international markets, the strong U.S. dollars put pressure on the cost of footwear and the ultimate retail price to consumers as most of the world purchases shoes in U.S. dollars. This, in turn, has and will continue to drive up the retail prices of footwear in many markets.Earlier this year, we chose the proactive path to protect gross margin by selectively increasing prices in our own international markets. We believe this action was appropriate for the long-term health of our brands and business, realizing it to put some pressure on revenue growth in the short term.In addition to currency, one of the biggest stories over the last several months has been softer global demand across many industries including consumer soft goods. This, in turn, is reflected in the economic challenges in China and its manufacturing slowdown. This has taken a toll on countries with commodity-based economies. For our business, a couple of examples of countries impacted by declining commodity prices are Russia and Canada, both of which have seen declining GDP this year. Although, not commodity-dependent and faring better, Europe has not been immune to the economic and consumer uncertainty and is still struggling to deliver economic growth above 2%.In the United States, while the economy has remained on relatively stable footings through the first half of the year, traffic trends at retail have remained soft.

With that being said, I'd like to turn the call over to Blake Krueger. Blake?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Earlier this morning, we reported our third quarter results highlighted by solid earnings in line with our original guidance. This performance is reflective of the high and consistent quality of our earnings engine, the power of our diversified brand portfolio, and the disciplined manner with which we operate our business.
In spite of the current global retail environment, which continues to be choppy, our consolidated business and two of our three brand operating groups generated adjusted revenue growth during the quarter, excluding the impact of currency, the Patagonia Footwear exit and store closures as applicable.

Mike and I will refer to adjusted revenue in this context in our remarks. But we'll also provide corresponding reported revenue figures. In step with our previously announced demand creation investment strategy, our quarterly marketing investment increased approximately 26% to support the long-term health and vitality of our brands. We remain committed to investing behind our brands and plan to accelerate revenue growth through product innovation, and deeper and more insightful consumer connections, all supported by a strong operational platform and our extensive global distribution footprint.
For today's call, I'll cover our consolidated and brand operating group results, speak to some of the headwinds in the global marketplace, and then focus on key brand performances and related strategic updates for the quarter, specifically, the Stride Rite, Sperry and Merrell brands.
Beginning with consolidated results. Adjusted revenue grew 0.7% versus the prior year, and reported revenue was $676.9 million (sic) [$678.9 million] (4:16), a 4.5% decrease year-over-year. We delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.48 for the quarter, in line with our original guidance and achieved strong gross margins across the portfolio, while effectively managing discretionary SG&A, which was only partially offset by the increased marketing investments behind our brand.
Focusing in on the brand operating group performance, starting with the Performance Group. Adjusted revenue grew 3.8% with Chaco posting exceptionally strong double-digit growth, Merrell generating low single-digit growth, and Saucony contributing mid-single digit growth in the quarter.
Adjusted revenue for the Lifestyle Group was down 5.1% with Sperry down less than 1%, Keds down low single digits, and Stride Rite down high single digits. Hush Puppies saw a constant currency low-teens decline, due primarily to our decision to realign our domestic distribution strategy. The brand's international licensee business remains strong with revenue up double digits.
Concluding with the Heritage Group, adjusted revenue grew 2.9% with Cat delivering mid-single digit growth, Wolverine producing low single digit growth, HYTEST growing at a solid double-digit pace, Bates down less than 1%, and Harley-Davidson down high-single digit. Mike will provide additional detail regarding our financial results in a few minutes.
So, now let me share our perspective on the global macroeconomic environment, which impacted our results in the third quarter and is expected to continue into the near future. Heading into the back half of the year, we identified and planned for a variety of global macroeconomic challenges, many of which persisted and some of which became more challenging relative to our prior expectations.
Although many of our key global markets have performed well, a number of others are exhibiting some stress for a variety of different reasons. In many international markets, the strong U.S. dollars put pressure on the cost of footwear and the ultimate retail price to consumers as most of the world purchases shoes in U.S. dollars. This, in turn, has and will continue to drive up the retail prices of footwear in many markets.
Earlier this year, we chose the proactive path to protect gross margin by selectively increasing prices in our own international markets. We believe this action was appropriate for the long-term health of our brands and business, realizing it to put some pressure on revenue growth in the short term.
In addition to currency, one of the biggest stories over the last several months has been softer global demand across many industries including consumer soft goods. This, in turn, is reflected in the economic challenges in China and its manufacturing slowdown. This has taken a toll on countries with commodity-based economies. For our business, a couple of examples of countries impacted by declining commodity prices are Russia and Canada, both of which have seen declining GDP this year. Although, not commodity-dependent and faring better, Europe has not been immune to the economic and consumer uncertainty and is still struggling to deliver economic growth above 2%.

In the United States, while the economy has remained on relatively stable footings through the first half of the year, traffic trends at retail have remained soft. Consumers' sentiment has eroded somewhat in recent month and unseasonably warm weather appears to have stunted early fall shopping.
We believe that inventories at retail have been building through the year, resulting in tight open-to-buy and a more cautious stance by retailers ahead of the critical holiday shopping season. A combination of these factors across numerous markets around the world resulted in a tougher demand environment, especially late in the third quarter, and we believe that it's prudent to expect many of these factors to persist in the fourth quarter and the first half of 2016.
This has caused us, along with others in and outside of our industry to temper the near-term outlook. While we have a strong brand portfolio and a resilient business model, we expect the short-term environment to remain status quo.
The obvious question is how we are adjusting to the current global realities. Over the past year, we have strategically and tactically adjusted to this dynamic environment in a number of different ways. Specifically, our inventory is high quality and it's as clean as it has been in several years. We are narrow and deep in core styles and collections, which puts us in a position to satisfy consumers and retail customers who are buying closer to need.
Second, we have initiated actions across our brand portfolio to develop products to backfill price points that have been impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. We have also critically reviewed the scope of our brick-and-mortar store fleet to align the number of stores with the changes in consumer, shopping behavior and the impact of digital, social and mobile technologies. The team has focused on forging stronger relationships with our customers through deep insights, compelling marketing and by creating a consistent omni-channel experience.
And lastly, we have invested in our innovation and product creation engines to generate new offerings consistent with current consumer product preferences especially in the ath-leisure athletic category. We know that growth is dependent on offering the consumer a great brand experience and something that is unique beyond price and believe these initiatives will drive future growth and closer connections with our consumers. We expect that our business model will continue to generate strong free cash flow and a high quality earnings stream.
I'll now focus on the key brand performances in the quarter and related strategic updates starting with Stride Rite. Stride Rite's exposure to the domestic brick-and-mortar store channel created the most significant challenge for the company in the third quarter. Sluggish macro retail traffic trends in an aggressive promotional environment presented some headwinds especially as we saw it to be less promotional. Although our store conversion improved, traffic declines persisted.
Given the current retail environment in the trend in Stride Rite stores, we are taking action to refocus the Stride Rite business and update our Strategic Realignment Plan, which is focused on realigning our consumer direct priorities and resource allocation to fuel e-commerce, mobile and omni-channel initiatives. This plan, which was originally announced over a year ago, has proven to be the right direction. And we have decided to reevaluate the Stride Rite brick-and-mortar fleet with an even more critical eye.
We plan to ensure optimal rationalization of our stores and to continue our investments in digital initiatives where we are seeing strong growth and great progress. This will all better align the brand with how the modern mom is shopping. At the same time, we intend to continue with our progress in thoughtfully expanding our wholesale distribution in conjunction with a strict product segmentation strategy to make the brand more accessible to consumers. We expect the result will be a healthier Stride Rite Children's Group, aligned with today's consumer, and poised to focus on the brand's best opportunities.

Switching gears to Sperry. The Sperry business was essentially flat in the third quarter with adjusted revenue down less than 1%. This top line performance was softer than expected with most of the decline coming from the boat shoe category. However, the brand's product category expansion strategy has started to produce meaningful results to offset the women's fashion trend, cycling away from the boat shoes silhouette.
Non-boat product categories contributed nearly half of the brand's total revenue in the quarter and delivered very strong double-digit growth, especially in vulcanized sneakers and boots. The brand also delivered a strong 380 basis point gross margin expansion in the quarter, a key initiative for us through select product price increases and the benefits from the Odysseys Await campaign.
In 2015, we made investments to position Sperry for long-term sustainable growth as a global lifestyle brand. We launched the Odysseys Await platform this spring. And we're now seeing data that this investment is beginning to move the needle with the consumer, growing brand awareness, solidifying brand affinity and influencing purchasing decisions.
We also brought the platform to life in a new store design that is currently being rolled out and is producing very strong double-digit comp revenue growth while nearly doubling the penetration of apparel and accessories.
Although Sperry is an established business of significant size today, we believe it is still in the early stages of its lifecycle with incredible growth potential for the company. And we're excited by the early successes to move beyond its dominant position in the boat shoe category.
Moving to Merrell, the Merrell brand was up 1% on a constant currency basis and remains a leader in the Performance outdoor footwear category. Its new Performance collections, Capra and All Out, continue to win at retail during the third quarter. The smaller active Lifestyle category followed a stronger Q2 with a softer Q3. But the new men's Telluride and women's Ashland collections successfully launched late in the quarter and are performing well this fall.
Increasing brand awareness for Merrell is a critical opportunity, as consumers who know the brand love it. But today, the brand ranks relatively low in consumer awareness. This is a significant opportunity. The new leadership team has developed a new brand platform and product initiatives along with an aggressive go-to-market strategy designed to amplify Merrell in the marketplace and increase awareness.
Merrell plans to support a more robust and compelling product assortment with the launch of the new brand platform, Do What's Natural, and associated demand creation investment. A planned comprehensive go-to-market strategy will focus on driving results at retail with key retail partnerships. Partners that signed up to present specific product franchises like the expanded Moab collection as their big story and have committed to critical space on the sales floor and other supporting investments. The strategy is in place and the partners have lined up to support this growth initiative.
As a company, we have a balanced business model that has consistently delivered earnings in a variety of global macroeconomic environments. Our strategic advantages within the global marketplace remained clear and compelling. First, our portfolio of authentic heritage brands provides us with an opportunity to service many different consumer groups across the wide range of product categories and countries.
Second, we also possessed an exceptionally strong operations platform. Third, our extensive global distribution footprint has been a competitive advantage for us for decades. And lastly, we have a deep and seasoned global team. While we expect the near-term global retail environment to remain somewhat challenging, this landscape creates some great opportunities for our brands to expand internationally. In the short-term, we are especially focused on executing against our business model, which has consistently produced strong cash flow and a high-quality earnings stream to help drive our strategic brand investments. I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for our family of brands.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike Stornant, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide additional commentary on our performance in the third quarter, as well as more details regarding our expectations for the balance of the year. Mike?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Thanks, Blake, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased with our earnings performance in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.48 per share, in line with our original guidance of $0.47 to $0.49 per share.
Earnings were bolstered by a strong gross margin performance and discipline around discretionary spending which allowed us to increase our marketing investment by approximately 26% and overcome a softer-than-expected revenue performance. Adjusted revenue was up 0.7% in the quarter after considering FX, store closures, and exiting the Patagonia Footwear business, and reported revenue of $678.9 million was down 4.5% compared to last year.
Third quarter revenue growth was lower than expected, due primarily to several factors that impacted our North American business. The softness in Q3 revenue can be categorized as follows. Direct to consumer, predominantly Stride Rite store performance, contributed roughly one-third of the net shortfall. Footwear retail traffic in the U.S. market was softer in the quarter, and traffic for our stores was also challenged. Key tactics expected to drive improvements in comp store performance especially for our Stride Rite stores were not as productive as expected. In addition, efforts to be less promotional within our stores and online put pressure on growth.
Wholesale revenue excluding our DTC channels for Sperry and Merrell contributed roughly one-third of the net shortfall, focused mainly in the North American market. The remaining softness was experienced in our North American wholesale business across several brands.
During the quarter, retailers became more cautious as the U.S. retail landscape remained promotional, and inventory levels continued to increase across channels. We believe these factors impacted demand for many of our brands. We continue to believe that the fundamental strength of our operating model and the disciplined way we run our business gives us a distinct competitive advantage. Our healthy earnings performance in Q3 is evidence of this.
Let me provide more insight regarding the key actions that helped to deliver our earnings results in the quarter. Gross margin in Q3 was 40%, slightly better than we forecasted and flat with the prior year, despite 60 basis points of FX headwinds. Our brands have been very proactive with strategic price increases across various categories and markets to protect or enhance gross margin, many of which were implemented in Q3.
In addition, product costs were managed very effectively, highlighting the operational excellence of what we believe to be our best-in-class product development and supply chain operations. These actions helped to offset the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar in our non-U.S. markets, a lower contribution from higher margin DTC revenue and other mix shifts across the portfolio. The company remains very focused on protecting gross margin performance across the business.
Adjusted operating expenses were $191 million, up $4.2 million or 2.2% versus the prior year, including a $3.4 million increase in non-cash pension expense. This result was meaningfully better than our projections as the business responded quickly to a retail environment that softened during the quarter. Variable cost declined naturally due to the lower sales volume and discretionary spending was managed effectively. The company continued to invest in important demand creation initiatives, albeit at a slightly lower level than originally planned. As mentioned, overall marketing spend was up approximately 26% in the quarter.

Incentive and stock compensation expenses were lower than planned and approximately $4 million lower than last year. Adjusted operating margin was a very strong 11.9%, up significantly from our expectations entering the quarter. Net interest expense in the quarter was approximately $9 million or $1 million lower than the prior year, reflecting the year-over-year principal reductions, including year-to-date voluntary principal payments of $58 million made in the first quarter, and a lower interest rate on our term loan driven by our declining leverage ratio.
The adjusted quarterly tax rate of 30.4% was higher than projected and higher than the prior year due mostly to a shift in the jurisdictional mix and the timing of certain discrete items. The reported tax rate in the quarter was 29%.
In addition to a solid quarterly earnings performance, the company's balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $196.4 million and net debt of $629 million, down $236 million since Q3 of 2014 and down $544 million since the acquisition of PLG in 2012.
Our current leverage ratio is 2.3 times compared with 4.0 time at closing, and we project full-year adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our credit agreement, to be in the range of $340 million to $350 million. Third quarter accounts receivable improved by $109.3 million or 22.6%, benefiting from the financing agreement entered into in Q4 of 2014, and from continued improvements in DSO and cash collections.
Inventories were up 6.3% due mostly to lower-than-anticipated sales in the quarter and incremental investments in cold weather product for Sperry in advance of Q4. We believe the quality of our inventory today is very high, with a healthy aging relative to last year. We continue to use disciplined tactics to manage inventory levels, which includes adjusting the supply chain inflow where appropriate, maximizing selling opportunities within our own DTC channels, working closely with retailers on future demand planning, and liquidating non-core items due to the traditional closeout channels.
Inventory levels appear to be relatively high across the retail landscape, including traditional closeout channels. And therefore, we expect that it will take a few quarters to manage inventories down to a normalized level. As our current inventory position is clean and largely constitutes core styles, we believe our approach is preferable to liquidating otherwise good inventory and overly reduced prices.
During Q3, we took advantage of our healthy credit standing, strong balance sheet and favorable market conditions to amend our senior secured credit facility, which, among other things, extended the term by nearly two years, upsized the revolver capacity to $500 million, and resulted in more favorable pricing. This amendment is projected to provide us greater capacity as we consider strategic opportunities and more flexibility related to certain restricted payments, including future dividends and share repurchases. On a year-to-date basis, we repurchased approximately 447,500 shares of the company's stock. We have just over $187 million remaining under the stock buyback program approved by our Board of Directors in 2014 and plan to continue to look for favorable buyback opportunities over the balance of the year.
Now, let me turn to our 2015 guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. During Q3, macroeconomic challenges in international markets persisted, and the U.S. retail market softened. We believe these conditions will continue in the short-term and the expectations for a strong holiday season remain mixed. As a result, we are updating our Q4 and full-year revenue and earnings guidance as follows.
Adjusted Q4 revenue is now expected to be flat to down low-single digits compared with Q4 2014, a quarter when we experienced growth of 9.2%. Reported quarterly revenue will be in line – will be in the range of $750 million to $770 million or down approximately 5% to 7.5%. Adjusted full-year revenue is now expected to be up low-single digits and reported full-year revenue is now expected to be $2.69 billion to $2.71 billion or down 2% to 2.5%.

We now expect Q4 gross margin to be up slightly despite a 100-basis-point headwind from FX. Full-year gross margin is expected to be flat with the prior year. Adjusted Q4 operating expenses are now expected to be down low-single digits compared to last year despite a $5.6 million increase in non-cash pension expense. For the full year, adjusted operating expenses are expected to be up very low-single digits despite a $16 million increase in non-cash pension expense.
Net interest and other expenses are expected to improve in Q4 by approximately $8 million as a result of lower debt position, lower pricing under the new credit facility, and other benefits. The full-year adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be in the range of 26.5% to 27%. This rate is lower than our previous guidance of approximately 27.5% as a result of a shift in jurisdictional mix of taxable income and some discrete benefits expected to be recognized in the fourth quarter.
Based on all of these factors, Q4 adjusted earnings per share are now expected to be $0.31 to $0.34 per share, an increase of approximately 3% to 13% compared with last year, and full-year adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be $1.44 to $1.47 per share.
I also wanted to provide an update on revenue guidance for Merrell and Sperry. Given the aforementioned global headwinds and challenging retail environment, we now expect Merrell's constant currency revenue to be flat with last year and Sperry to deliver low-single digit constant currency growth for the full year. With regards to Merrell, continued strong growth in the Performance category is forecasted to be offset by softness in our active Lifestyle segment along with some specific regional challenges, given the brand's expansive international footprint.
For Sperry, strong growth in boots, vulcanized and active styles, coupled with the steady growth in consumer direct and international are forecasted to be partially offset by softness in the boat category.
I will now provide an update on the go-forward strategy for our brick-and-mortar fleet especially for Stride Rite stores. Blake spoke to our Stride Rite business and our Strategic Realignment Plan in his prepared remarks. And now, I will provide some additional color on specific steps we are taking to improve the returns in this important but underperforming segment of the business. Our Strategic Realignment Plan was initiated in July 2014 and updated during our Q2 earnings call.
In July, we shared an updated plan to ultimately close 175 stores with approximately 120 stores expected to close by the end of 2015. As a reminder, we shuttered 59 doors in 2014 under this plan. Based on current store performance and trends and consumer shopping preferences, we now anticipate closing an additional 25 Stride Rite stores, increasing the ultimate closure count from 175 stores to 200 stores across the portfolio.
We are currently reviewing our lease exit strategy and negotiating with our landlords, a process that will continue through the balance of the year. We still expect to close at least 120 stores under the plan by the end of 2015. The remaining store closures are planned to happen in 2016 or at a normal lease expiration, and this would be determined based on the outcome of our negotiations.
For Stride Rite, this would leave a go-forward fleet of approximately 125 doors. This reconstituted fleet is expected to be much more productive and profitable, located in a combination of viable, specialty, and outlet centers across the U.S., and most importantly, in line with the go-forward strategy of the brand.
As a result of incremental cost associated with store closures and further reorganization changes across the portfolio, we now expect reported diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.28 to $1.31 per share for fiscal 2015. We will provide more details on the Strategic Realignment Plan and associated costs and savings as part of our fourth quarter conference call.

Before we open the call up to take questions, I want to emphasize just a few points. The leadership team at Wolverine remains incredibly focused on those initiatives and activities that will reenergize growth and allow us to fully leverage our great global brand portfolio. As we have done in the past, we will continue to operate in a diligent and disciplined manner both in the execution of our business model and the management of our working capital to deliver consistent profit and cash flow for our shareholders.
A key priority for cash will be to fuel organic growth by investing in key initiatives related to omni-channel expansion, international opportunities, product innovation, and further talent acquisition. As always, we planned to continue to carefully evaluate other opportunities including share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.
Thanks for your time this morning. We will now turn the call back over to the operator. Operator?

The first question comes from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thanks. Good morning.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jim.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Hi, Jim.
Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Question for you guys on the Stride Rite brick-and-mortar business. Does that business make money? And can you help us with a better understanding of the calculus around restructuring? What type of comps are you assuming in the economic assessment for the stores looking forward? Are you assuming that the store base continues to comp negatively in your assessment of which stores need to be closed?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We've got a complete fleet review under the way, Jim. The brick-and-mortar stores themselves at the present time are not profitable. So, we believe that going forward, the 125 stores or so stores that would be part of the go-forward fleet will be profitable. You have to remember Stride Rite, which has a dominant presence in mid-tier and better children shoes in the United States, has, frankly, a great and profitable wholesale business and also a growing e-commerce business as well. So, our assumptions going forward for the 125 stores are fairly conservative. There is no hockey-stick positive assumption assumed in our part, a realistic bottoms-up examination of the fleet.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
That's right. And just to add to that, I mean, we're looking at, obviously, the best real estate in the fleet. The stores that remain on the go-forward fleet list are those that are – where the four wall is obviously the highest and where they have the most momentum, Jim. So, the other part of the profitability of that model, obviously, has to do with just how we operate underneath that and with many fewer stores, we think we can be much more efficient and more productive with the support that goes along with running those stores. So, our modeling right now, as Blake said, is pretty conservative, but our ability to focus on the right stores and the right real estate makes the math work out a little bit easy for us.
Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Mike, will that be a pro forma benefit to earnings, the more aggressive store closure agenda?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yes, it will.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah.
Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
And then another question for you guys. Just looking forward, how much do you feel you need to reset volumes to keep the inventory balance at retail at a healthier level? Mike, I know you mentioned this is going to last for a couple quarters. Are you guys indeed seeing down orders as you look into spring 2016?

Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Jim, I think, we've seen with a kind of a mixed back-to-school season here domestically in the U.S., a very warm September. I think we've seen, as you know, from the reports, inventory of retailers in the United States have kind of ticked up all year. So, we think the channel now is fairly full, any number of distribution channels here in the United States. I would also say that in this type of an environment, it's no surprise that retailers are taking a pretty cautious approach to reorders and their own inventory levels.
So, we don't really see that environment changing that much over here over the next several months. Certainly, our inventory is narrow and deep in core styles and we're going to be ready to service our retail customers who need it over the next several months.
Jim V. Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. Thank you.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP

The next question comes from Ed Yruma of KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question this morning. I know that you aren't going to spend the full allotment of demand creation dollars. So, I guess, could you contextualize if you're still going to spend the $100 million over three years? And I know results have been a little bit difficult, so maybe it's hard to tell initially but are you seeing positive results? And I know much of the spend was targeted towards Sperry this year. Thank you.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say on the incremental investment spend, right now, our three-year plan is intact. And we would proceed along our original line. Frankly, for this year, it's come down a few million dollars, our spend, but 80% or so of the spend this year occurred in the first half and Q3 with only about 20% planned in Q4. So, this year, you're right, it was about two-third spend on Sperry. And frankly, next year, our focus will be on the Merrell brand.
Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Got it. And clearly, the foreign market's been challenged, but I guess are you seeing kind of increased incursions in the Merrell space and do you think that's weighing on results? Thank you very much.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
We haven't really seen that. I mean, as you know, competition is always fierce in our industry domestically and on a global basis. Merrell still remains the category champion in Performance outdoor product. We've missed the beat over the last couple of years in the Lifestyle area, but the new team is kind of focused on righting the ship there and getting back to healthy growth in that category.
Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Jay Sole of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hey. Good morning.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Jay.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So, want to follow up on the inventory. It sounds like the inventory is clean in terms of the quality and the inventory is high. But maybe there's a little bit more than you'd like and part of the plan, among many things, is to delay some future receipts. Now if that's right, at what point does the inventory that's high quality now become aged? How quickly do you have to move it to avoid having those big markdowns at the end of the season for the inventory?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah, exactly. It's a good question, Jay. I mean, this is really, obviously, very new inventory. We talked about it at the end of Q3. We mentioned Sperry, who's built up a little bit of inventory around their boot program. And that's selling through really well right now. We don't see there being any issues moving through that inventory.

Some of our other boot brands also built a little bit more inventory in the quarter, had a little more – had a little bit of softness in revenue, as we mentioned. But it's core product and they've already made the adjustments. It's not something that we're doing right now, but they scaled back on their inflow of goods a few months ago. And they'll have their inventory levels down by the end of the year on the boot stuff. So, it sort of depends by brand, but in general, we don't think a two-quarter or three-quarter work through of this would be unusual based on the nature – the core nature of the inventory. But at the same time, we're being conservative. We're trying to be conservative to sort of plan through that way. We get opportunities to move the inventory faster, we will. But we're not going to take silly price concessions at this point. It's not the right thing to do for the business. Our balance sheet is still super strong, so we don't need to take any kind of drastic effort to quickly reduce the inventory faster than what would rationally be done.
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Blake, you just touched on competition before. Can you just talk in broad terms about market share for some of the different brands, maybe in the U.S. and by the way, congratulations on a great Michigan State victory last weekend.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. That's exactly how I had planned the last 10 seconds of the game, just to let you know. But anyway, they pulled it out. I'm sitting here with Stornant who's a University of Michigan fan. So, it's been a little hefty here over the last couple of days. But I would – specifically, what was your question?
Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Just on competition, just your thoughts on how the different brands are faring in terms of market share in the U.S.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say – let me go through our big brands. As you know, the data is not perfect. It comes from a couple of different sources. It doesn't cover the whole footwear market, and this is domestically. The data internationally is even harder to get and make any sense out. But as you know, the U.S. footwear market grew about maybe 5% over the last 12 months, more than half of that probably was price increases. So, a relatively stable overall market in terms of pairs.
Clearly, when you look at trends today, one of the big trends – continuing big trends has been ath-leisure and athletic casual. We've got a number of brands who can participate in that arena. To be a little self-critical of the company, we probably have not been fast enough trying to take market share in that area, market share for Merrell, Saucony, Sperry, Keds and even the hush puppy body shoe collection. So, that probably – since this has been a long service trend, probably five years or six years, a bit of miss for the company. Merrell retains its number one position in Performance outdoor, certainly in the Lifestyle category. It's got a lot of room for growth. Sperry remains absolutely dominant in both. But especially on the women's side, we know that the boat shoe silhouette has been trending downward from a fashion perspective. It had frankly leveled off a couple of the quarters earlier in the years and it's trending down a little bit again.
So Sperry, Merrell, kind of still dominant in their core categories. Wolverine boot remains the number one work boot brand in the premium market across the U.S. market. Cat, more of an international brand, really an urban lifestyle brand on an international front. It's seen some very solid growth. And then our other brands also fill some niche areas. Like as I've said, Stride Rite is clearly dominant in kids.

Jay Sole - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Got it. Thanks so much.

The next question comes from Taposh Bari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Good morning. It's Chad Sutherland on for Taposh.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yes.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Can we go through the constant currency sales by geography, so EMEA, APAC, LATAM, et cetera?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, let me see if we can find the exact data.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
I would (44:54)
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. In constant currency, I would say our International business overall did very well in the quarter. The two regions that performed best were Latin America. So it was nice to see kind of a spring back from some trends we'd seen in Latin America over the last couple of quarters. Asia Pacific, certainly, as a percentage growth, was our number one region for growth. Really, Europe and U.S. were somewhat more challenged markets in the quarter. So, if you're looking at it from a quarter standpoint, International Group certainly met or exceeded expectations with the best performance by far in Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. They were both up over 20% in the quarter kind of as expected. And we talked a lot about some of the challenges we had in the EMEA region going into the quarter. In our last call, we talked about challenges for Russia and Italy and some of the markets in the EMEA region. So, it's fairly flat in the EMEA, but the other two regions were really strong.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. And then, just to follow up on Keds, it looks like the performance there slowed down pretty meaningfully in the quarter. Any color, any context on what's going on with that brand and what the outlook is?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, really, Keds did not anniversary. They had a pretty – a significant transaction last year in Q3 with one retailer decided for a variety of reasons not to anniversary that this year. When you take away that one – basically, that one transaction, Keds this quarter would have been up double digits again. So, our expectations for Keds' future growth is unabated at this point.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
And that was expected, too, Chad. That was not a surprise.
Chad H. Sutherland - Goldman Sachs & Co.

The next question comes from Corinna Van der Ghinst of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Good morning. Thank you.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Good morning. Just thinking of some of the discretionary SG&A reductions that you guys were able to take in the third quarter, how much more flexibility is there in your SG&A plan for Q4 versus what's embedded in you guidance today? And could you kind of just walk us through what specific buckets could be flexed to lower if necessary?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sure. Yeah. When we look at Q3, there was a variety of things. And I tried to highlight the bigger contributors in my prepared comments, but obviously, with volume, there's some variable costs there that would change. Blake mentioned the fact that we still have committed some of our demand creation investment. We're not planning to adjust that at this point.
The typical things that we do from day to day across a 15-brand portfolio in every region of the world, we have levers that we can manage in a proactive basis. In the third quarter, we had to respond to some trends that sort of materialize in the quarter, and going into Q4, we have a little more visibility to what some of those would be. We're being pragmatic about that in Q4. And I would say, there's probably a little less flexibility in the Q4 number than in the Q3 number. But, as always, we'll monitor and continue to challenge our spending in all the discretionary areas during the course of the quarter.

Corinna Gayle Van der Ghinst - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. And then, just to follow up on Sperry, it looks like the setup this winter is for a pretty strong season for cold weather boots, and you mentioned shipping in some very cold weather products in the third quarter. What is your guidance kind of incorporate for that business? Do you need to see a strong cold winter season in order to meet the current guidance for Sperry? And if there is a strong season, is there additional capacity to chase that once demand is there?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, we overemphasized our investment in Sperry boots for this fall. I would say that of all of our brands, probably Sperry is the least affected by weather at this point, it appears, in this fall season. Their boot programs have sold in very well early. They're selling through very well right now. We probably wished with hindsight we even had a little more inventory than we have today, but Sperry's initiative kind of to move beyond both and especially this year into vulcanized sneakers and into the boot category has been very successful. So, we don't really see any risk at all with Sperry on the boot side for this fall.

The next question comes from Jonathan Komp of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks, guys. Maybe if I can start with just a clarification on Sperry. Blake, I know you've talked about the Odysseys Await campaign, leading to some improvements in the customer metrics that you track. And I'm wondering if you can just provide a little more context to that and then maybe some color on when you think that brand can get back to sustainable growth going forward.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think there's no doubt we saw with the pretty significant investment in the first half, continued behind Sperry which continued into Q3. We saw the metrics really move in the right direction for that brand, whether it's consumer affinity or especially brand awareness. We saw very strong triple, quadruple-digit increase in awareness for both men and women for Sperry in especially that critical 16-year-old to 24-year-old demographic. So, that was very good news. Sperry is obviously focused on product creation and innovation. It's focused especially in moving beyond boat. Sperry is a wonderful brand, no impediment. Our retail customers want and need a big Sperry business. The consumer is certainly accepting of Sperry's expansion into other footwear categories. So, we're obviously going to focus on that and continue.
Certainly, as far as overall growth, we're just looking to see what happens with the boat shoe trend from a fashion standpoint, pretty much more on the women's side than the men's. There's been a little leveling off in the men's, but that's been more of a steady-on category for Sperry. It's really the fashion trend on the women's side that's been – that we're replacing, frankly, with product beyond boat.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. That's helpful.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
The only thing I'd add too, just on the platform investment and some of the things that are happening there. Really important to know that our international partners have embraced that platform, too, looking at opening new stores under the new concept, but just a much more accessible global platform in the old Sperry Top-Sider story. And I think that's really important, because we obviously see opportunity for growth for Sperry outside of the U.S.

Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. That's helpful. Maybe then just a broader question, as you look forward today for the overall business heading into 2016. I'm sure we'll hear a lot more about this in a few months. But just wondering if you can maybe, from a high level, talk through some of the major puts and takes that you see. And as you sit here today, if you think kind of a meaningful earnings growth scenario is possible next year given some of the puts and takes that you see.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say it's – we've just entered the fourth quarter. We haven't even completed this year's holiday season. So, we're really not in the position to give you as much as everyone might like at some specifics on 2016 guidance. I would say that really kind of my prepared remarks kind of say it all. We've taken maybe a conservative view of the world right now and the global consumer. At the present time, we think this is an opportunity for us to take market share in various markets around the world.
And you have to remember, our business model consistently produces record free cash flow and earnings. One of the things we forget about is even if you go back to 2009, the biggest recession year we had, we had about a 10% decrease in sales, currency neutral. Our business model and the teams still delivered a record earnings and profit in that year. So, I think that's kind of reflective of just what's in our DNA and how we can operate the business. We're pretty efficient operators across our brand portfolio.
Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Got it. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.

The next question comes from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Great. Thank you. Good morning. Blake, I guess for you and then maybe, Mike, if you could weigh in as well. I mean, given how you guys have framed up the environment, could you just speak a little bit more about the underlying sales assumptions for Q4? So, maybe particularly delving in on the wholesale side, what are you assuming for reorders?
And then has the initial order pattern shifted back later in the quarter? And then maybe if you can finally just parse it out by what you're seeing with some of your better department stores versus the mid-tier versus the family channel. That would be helpful.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would – I think, Erinn, you have to remember about half our pairs are sold in international markets. But we can certainly focus on the U.S. market. I think retailers right now and consumers, to a certain extent, are buying closer to need. They're taking a conservative approach coming off the back-to-school season. We've all seen the numbers from the retail federation as to what they expect the holiday season, which is a bit softer than what we experienced last year. So, I think retailers and consumers are buying closer to need. We're certainly going to have the inventory and core styles to satisfy that.
As far as channels are concerned, it's still a little bit early to get a read on that. Certainly, we know that the more price sensitive, lower distribution has done well over the last couple of years. With respect to the promotional environment, I believe it's going to be very promotional this fall. I think if this weather pattern continues a little bit, we're already seeing some increased promotions across the industry. We think Black Friday is going to start substantially earlier than Black Friday, for example. So, it's just the environment we find it in right now.

Clearly, though, if you're a brand or a retailer that is out there with fresh product, you're going to do well at just about any price. So, it's interesting across our business. Some of our most expensive product, Wolverine 1000 Mile, Sperry Gold Cup, some of our more premium priced product continues to sell through very well and register with the consumer. So it's a little early yet. I think the mid tier department stores in the U.S. will probably be a little bit more promotional than they were last year in this environment.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yeah. Just to add a couple things, Erinn, to that point. A good example for Merrell is how much success they had in the third quarter with some of that premium distribution. That's really for the really strong category form especially in the U.S. that your Performance product was up almost 5% in Q3. So there's some interesting, interesting signs there in terms of how the market is working. In terms of the way we developed our revenue forecast for the quarter, Q4 is typically a quarter where we'll see about a third of the orders come through as at once or reorders, the sort of the nature of our business during that quarter. Q2 and Q4 are the quarters where we see more of that activity.
So we're still assuming that we obviously have the benefit now of three full quarters of order intake and everything else to kind of use as a barometer for what we're projecting into Q4. And so we're being – I'll say we're being properly realistic about what we expect in Q4. And that's obviously one of the reasons why you see the revenue guidance coming down to the level that it is. So we've got brands that are winning. We've got several brands that are planning really meaningful growth in the fourth quarter based on the demand they're seeing in their business. Saucony is one of those brands that will see double-digit growth in Q4 and we've got some of our other brands in the mid to high single digit range as well. But our order assumptions and our revenue projections are fairly conservative at this point.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Thank you, Mike. And then just on the Stride Rite closures, what's the impact implied in your fourth quarter guidance?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
And impact relative to...
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Just to revenue, excuse me.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Revenue. There aren't – there's nothing changed. Most of the stores – I think all of the stores at this point that are still open will be opened almost all the way to the last day of the year.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
But from a revenue standpoint, there won't be any impact until next year.
Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. And then just my last clarification question, just going back to Jay's question on inventory, so it does sound like it's going to take two quarters to three quarters maybe to work through some of the inventory. I guess, specifically, where are you planning the increase to be by the fourth quarter end? Thanks.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
We're still – we've got – we're up about 6.5% right now. It's possible based on some of the trends and, again, it depends on brand. I mentioned our boot brands. We expect the boot brands are going to get back to normal by the end of the quarter. So, we're projecting something similar in the high single digits. But it could be – very well be slightly better than that if we get the right weather and other conditions help us out.

Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Okay. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.

The next question comes from Christian Buss of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yeah. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you're finding SG&A savings to bring that SG&A dollar amount down in the fourth quarter.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Where we're finding savings, Christian?
Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Yes.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Again, similar to Q3, we're going to see some of those variable costs flow through. We've got benefits in several different areas. And some of the benefit that we got in Q3 related to some incentive comp adjustments, those will flow through to a much smaller extent in Q4 as well. There's not really one focused area. Our marketing spend in the fourth quarter is going to be flat with the prior year at this point based on our projection. So – and as Blake said, we still have a little more to spend on our demand creation investment. So, it comes from a variety of different areas that, frankly, we look at on a quarter-by-quarter, period-by-period basis.
Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
That's helpful. Thanks. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the level of visibility that you have right now? You mentioned some challenges with the open-to-buy. In the past, you've talked about the fourth quarter being a heavy reorder business. Could you talk a little bit about what's embedded in the expectations and in your visibility?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, overall, I think we've taken a fairly conservative view of our Q4 based on what happened in period nine or happened in mid – the last month of our third quarter. So, we did see cancellations tick up a little bit. We saw retailers getting a little bit more conservative. I'm talking here about the U.S. and not international of course. And we've reflected that all in our Q4 guidance.
Christian Roland Buss - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)

Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.
Good morning, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. But, Blake, I have one question for you. And I understand the reticence about speaking about 2016. But can you comment at all on the spring 2016 – spring/summer 2016 order book trend you're seeing there, whether you're – where you want to be or not, just anything directionally there. And again, I understand the reticence of giving a specific number or even a directional number, but anything at all would be helpful. Thanks.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, I will say that, we don't comment on our order book anymore, as you know, for a variety of good reasons. It's still early to comment on 2016. We'll have plenty of details regarding our operating plan for 2016 when we report our Q4 results. I would say right now though that some of the overall trends we're seeing, attitude by retailers primarily here in the U.S., we're seeing that also reflected into 2016. They are just playing at a – are pretty conservative at the right time. Maybe we'll get some weather. Maybe a couple of other things will break for their business another way, but right now, they're taking a pretty conservative approach on any number of levels.

Steven L. Marotta - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.

The next question comes from Mitch Kummetz of B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yeah. Thanks. I just want to follow up on Steve's question because, Blake, in your prepared remarks, you talked about these factors persisting into early 2016 and you answered it there. So, what are the factors that you expect to persist? Is it just weak traffic trends? Is it high promotional levels? Is it conservative on the part of retailers?
And again, does that manifest itself in just – especially as you're thinking about the early part of 2016, does that manifest itself by retailers maybe revisiting their spring order books and maybe haircutting those or is there just underlying assumption that in Q1, you would still expect to pick up normally some re-orders on fall holiday and now, you probably think less of that will come through? Just based on those factors, could you just maybe elaborate a little bit more on that?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, Mitch. I mean, frankly, it's a little hard at this point since we're just getting into the holiday, or just approaching holiday selling season. I would say all of the factors you listed at the present time we believe are going to continue with respect to our domestic business. Our International business, which is about half of our pair, we are also anticipating that the dollar is going to remain very strong. So, in response, our brands are working on their product engines to bring in product – a lot of product to price points that have been vacated for international partners. So, we all read about the geopolitical risks and challenges that are going on everyday around the world. We really don't see any calming impact having there. We think it's going to be more a status quo.
We do think, though, at least domestically, retailers are buying closer to need and they're going to be reliant on brands that they trust and companies that can afford to be there with product when they need it. And really, I'm not being – I'm not trying to dodge your question. I'll have a lot more insight when we get into December. But that's kind of the status at the present time.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Got it. I can appreciate that. And then just as a housekeeping. One, what is your euro assumption for the fourth quarter? And then two, Mike, you talked a little bit about in your prepared remarks. I mean there's a gap between your sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter. And it sounds like some of that was on interest and tax. Could you just – if you just go over that again or just maybe get maybe a little more specific on what your specific Q4 interest expense, other income and tax assumptions are?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Sure. Yeah. I mean, I guess on the interest side we talked about that and there's – a big chunk of that benefit is just coming from lower debt position, lower cost of interest, et cetera. And there are just several other things that some of it relates to how we translate our balance sheet, re-measure foreign-denominated balance sheets, the re-measurement value of that, the impact of that flows through to that line item on the P&L. So, there's a little bit of benefit in there. And there are a few other things that are flowing through that particular line item.
The tax rate is really, again, very much about the dynamic of our global business. And we have an opportunity to recognize more income and some lower tax jurisdictions, including our Hong Kong business which is very profitable and at a very low tax rate. And then we also have just some discrete adjustments that we have planned to flow through in the fourth quarter that we didn't have last year.

The rate I quoted, I think full year rate, between $26.5 million and $27 million, that could be anywhere between $1 million and $1.5 million of tax benefit that would impact the rate. So, it's not that meaningful, but we're calling out in terms of updating the guidance. So, those are the main drivers there. As far as the exchange rate, you asked about the euro?
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Yeah.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
The spot rate right now or the forecasted rate that we use for Q4 assumption was 1.13.
Mitch Kummetz - B. Riley & Co. LLC
All right. Thanks, guys.

The next question comes from Chris Svezia of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Chris.
Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
So, I want to talk about pricing for a second, ASPs, and just kind of walk through. It seemed like in some brands, you are aggressive in pricing and had been. Maybe there's some pushback on the pricing thought process in some markets. But at the same time, we're also looking to, as you said earlier, backfill price points where other brands might have vacated. Just maybe talk about the pricing dynamic and your ability to take price and sacrifice a little bit of unit volume versus where you might have been six months ago on your thoughts on pricing and just how that plays out as we think about it going forward.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
I'll answer it first and then I'm sure Blake will want to offer some of his thoughts. But this is not a new tactic for us as a company. It was a pretty dramatic strengthening of the dollar as we entered into 2015 and probably had a bigger impact on our business this year than it would in a typical year. But the approach that we took is very consistent, and I don't think it's one that we regret at all. Our brands obviously continue to evaluate. What the impact really is out there is the fact that we raised prices, is it other consumer sentiment issues in those markets that are having a bigger impact on some of the demand issues. We obviously believe not only that we did the right thing. We have other competitors that didn't follow suit and are experiencing the same challenges in the market that we are.
So, the good news is we got there early. We've been able to price that and we'll be able to anniversary that into next year. So, the opportunity to bring in products at those different price points to complement the assortment is something I think is an advantage for us because we acted really from a pricing standpoint. We're taking a long-term view that the dollar is going to remain strong for a while. And so, there's really not an option for us to pull back on pricing at this point. That's not something that we want to do. But we're going to be very clear about every style and every opportunity, every brand in each market, everyone is different. And we will be reevaluating that based on the benefit of a full season's worth of sell-through and everything else with our own foreign businesses and our partners as well and so, the model going forward here is to stay the course, but also to look for other opportunities to enhance margin as we go into 2016.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I would say, Chris, as well, the sourcing environment that we're seeing right now is probably the best I've seen in the last five years. So, certainly labor and overhead continues to go up when it comes to product cost, but leather is down significantly from last year. Lower commodity prices are also contributing to lower quotes from our factories. So, this will be the first year in many years where on carryover product we're probably going to see a pricing decrease.

Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Okay. All right. Thank you. And then the second question I had was just on the Merrell brand. Just maybe walk through what you're thinking about for spring of 2016. I think in March, there's going to be a pretty significant investment and marketing campaign. Is anything based on what you've seen in the business so far changed that thought process? Is that still a go-forward strategy? And any color about what you might anticipate or what you anticipate seeing from that investment?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would think – just to take a step back from Merrell. I mean, obviously the continued focus on product creation and innovation, not just in the Performance category, but especially adding some talent on the Lifestyle side, for our International businesses in particular, backfilling with good product, maybe good product internationally that is now priced like better product.
And then, again to re-focus on athletic, casuals and ath-leisure. So, there is a number of levers that the team is pulling on the product creation side. We do intend to invest behind the brand platform, but a revised, more athletic company like go-to-market strategy for key offerings in the Merrell line. It can be an expanded Moab collection with one key strategic retail partner. I'm talking domestically now. It can be an expanded Capra program for another key strategic. It can be an expanded All Out program for another one and then some more moderately priced search and enjoy product for another key retailer. That's going to be a change for the brand and one that Jim gave and the team are implementing this year.
In my view, still a big opportunity for Merrell. A lot of people don't know about Merrell. We think everybody does because it has such a dominant position in the outdoor category, but a lot of people don't know about Merrell, and yet the brand consistently sits there with the number two intent to repurchase of all brands in this market. So, there's a lot of different levers to pull, a lot of them are on the product side and some new introductions, and we're going to invest behind.
Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
One quick follow-up is – I might have missed this, is Taylor Swift and Keds, is that still together after this year or is that – just any update on that relationship.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I haven't had a recent update but we think, certainly, Keds is coming out with a new brand platform and campaign. The Keds brand is frankly – I can't believe I'm saying this – but it's bigger than Taylor Swift, and she is about as big as you can get. But we're going to put more emphasis on the Keds brand this year, but we will still – it appears right now we will still have Taylor Swift on the Keds team into 2016.
Chris Svezia - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP

Hey, sorry about that. Sorry about that. Sorry about that, I know it's late.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Okay.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
So, just a few clarifications. Thanks for taking my question. So, the 100-basis-point FX headwinds in 4Q impacting gross margin, maybe talk about what the benefits or the offsets to get to an up gross margin in 4Q would be. I think there's something with the treatment of your LIFO expense.

Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
No, not really. Not this year. Sometimes that happens in the fourth quarter, but we had some easier comps in Q based on some adjustments that were made to last year's fourth quarter, some allowance and promotional stuff that we had to deal with related to some of our brands, getting out of some distribution that we're not happy with. And so, we took some of that pain in the fourth quarter last year, which kind of increased our markdown exposure and some of those things that we're not going to anniversary. That's part of it. And we talked about that last quarter.
But really, it's the price increases and it's the better quality of our business. And we were – we talked about cleanliness, I guess, or the high quality of our inventory. But it's really been true all year long. I mean, we're selling less closeouts. Our first quality sales are better. We've spent the last year really focused on cleaning up and focusing the inventory and it's had a real positive impact on gross margin. We talked about price increases for Sperry, as well as for our international markets and that's helped us to really combat or mitigate the currency costs. And we've had some other things go in our favor including the beginnings of some of the product cost benefits that Blake alluded to that'll be more meaningful next year, but still has a small benefit in the third quarter.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Thanks, Mike. And then, what percentage of your Sperry sales at this point are international?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
From a unit standpoint, it's about 10%.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
But that's all traditional distributor-based business now, right? You're not licensing that at all?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Pretty much, yeah. We don't have a licensed business for Sperry, yeah. I would say, over the last three years, the Sperry international – 2013 was kind of a get-started year for many of our brands, our Boston-based brands, Keds, Saucony and Sperry. And we've had real growth in 2014 and real growth in 2015 that's accelerating. But the Sperry international business has increased at over a 20% clip over that period of time, as has Saucony, and frankly, the Keds international business is even higher than that. So, we always knew it was going to take a little time. But once we get some traction, it continues to grow.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
And any visibility there? Is that going to continue at that rate?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, we expect all three of those brands to continue at that rate. I mean, I would say, Sperry doesn't have as large as international business as Hush Puppies or Merrell or even Saucony, but we expect it to certainly continue at that rate into the future.
Scott D. Krasik - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Great. Thanks a lot.

Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to know, could you give us the EBIT dollars by segment, number one? And to follow up on Mitch's question, what's the interest expense and the other expenses are expected for the fourth quarter in actual dollars? Could you just give us an idea of where that is or the range, please?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP

Give me the last part, Sam. I missed that.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
The interest expense and the other expenses in dollars expected in Q4.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
All right. I can give you that. So, in Q4, on a net basis, it's about $8 million this year versus about $15 million, almost $16 million last year, I guess. So, $8 million improvement.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Combined or is that the interest expense?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
No, that's combined. So, the interest expense...
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
So, what's the...
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Yep, the interest expense is $11 million versus $14 million last year. The other items are about $4 million benefit versus about $1 million expense last year.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay. Thanks. And then – and the EBIT by segment for the quarter?
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
We don't generally give that out in the call, Sam. So – and I don't have it by segment right here in front of me anyway. But we typically don't share that.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
No, I know. I just thought given the way the numbers have been changing over time and really that gives us a good look at the whole profitability picture by segment. Could you put out something before the Q and whenever that comes out to tell us because it will help everybody make a better gauge as to where things are, I believe.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Well, I think the Q is just about to go out. But we'll consider that in the future for sure.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Okay. And then you talked about the good sourcing, Blake, with the improvement in the sourcing. I know you've taken price increases, but I mean, what kind of efficiencies are you seeing? Are you changing the materials? Are you changing the materials that you're using, linings and so on to save money? Are you doing anything to upset the quality of the product or when you're doing – when you're making these changes?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. Not at all, Sam. These are just what I talked about before including the improving prices are really tied to weather, commodities and how all of that impacts the sourcing sheet by pair. None of what I talked to earlier really goes to any kind of de-specking the shoes or taking any actions in that regard. And frankly, that's not something we would do as a company. All of our bigger brands certainly have a better – a good, better, best brand offering. But we don't anticipate any significant changes there whatsoever.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Just one last question. When you're looking at Merrell and Sperry across the different categories and looking within the quarter and into next year, of whatever growth you're planning, I mean, how much of this growth is going to be within existing distribution? Let's talk about the U.S. because international we'll have an opportunity for Sperry, but with an existing distribution or adding new distribution to the brands?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Most of the growth for next year, we anticipate from taking more shelf space at existing distribution. So, we do not, right now, anticipate any – for example, any significant family channel increase over what we had in 2015, Sam.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
As an example, for Merrell, Sam, I mean all of the partnership alliances that Merrell has right now are all with premium retailers, pretty much. So, the growth there and the new go-to-market strategy is really to play up the premium product as much as possible, and gain share in that same distribution with the same retailers, not just the channel.

Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Well, that just brings another question and then I'll let it go. You talk a lot about the macro, about the way the retailers are. At the same time, I think, Blake, you mentioned that you have to be right on the money with the product and so on. So, I guess when you're looking at the world around you, how much of the issues out there are basically you guys need to improve the products, improve the way you go to market with stuff versus the macro, because the macro, it seems like an equal opportunity annoyance for absolutely everybody.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I absolutely agree with you, Sam. I mean, the macro environment impacts everybody. We all know it begins with products, products, products. We know that in our industry, there is quite a bit a need as well as want, and if you're out there with great product, you've got a chance to win in any environment.
And, when you look at Merrell and Sperry, for Sperry, it's fundamentally how fast can they move beyond boat. They're going to remain dominant in the boat shoe category, an extremely important category here domestically and in some international markets. But obviously, a total acceptance by the Sperry consumer and retailers to move beyond boat for Sperry and they're focused on that.
And on Merrell, it's really a fundamental question of regaining some traction in the Lifestyle area for the brand. And again, the product creation innovation team there is busy on that. The new team, probably, is going to need a little more time to get where we want it to be, but that's the fundamental issue. The macro environment is going to test some smaller brands and smaller businesses. We've been through this before. We've seen this movie. And it's going to be a bit of a challenging environment for some good but maybe smaller brands and smaller businesses.
Samuel Marc Poser - CRT Capital Group LLC
Thank you for taking my questions. Thanks.
Michael D. Stornant - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer & Senior VP
Okay. Thanks, Sam.

The next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Can you update us on the number of international distributor signups? I think the last updated number was around 70. And can you tell us specifically how they are performing?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Are you talking about kind of our Boston-based brands?
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Correct.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think we've got new agreements or re-upped agreements for over 100 countries today for those brands. Since the beginning of 2013, we've added well over 400 points of dedicated distribution for those brands. Saucony, Keds and Sperry are all growing at over a 20% rate each year and that includes the kind of – that includes the start year, which is really 2013. So, we continue to see strong double-digit growth there. We – those brands are still all underpenetrated internationally when you compare them to, for instance, a Caterpillar or Merrell or Hush Puppies. So, again, still early there. We still continue to make progress.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Okay, great. And then last month it was outlined during a conference that you were thinking about an acquisition in the range of $200 million to $600 million. Curious to know your updated line of thinking on this as we start seeing a more challenging macroeconomic environment.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I would say – that's a good question. I would say that as you know, we have a very disciplined approach when it comes to acquisitions. We have a bit of an unusual macroeconomic environment in front of us right now. We're focusing a lot of our time, energy in growing what we have and in getting more earnings out of our current portfolio. That being said, if the right strategic opportunity came around, the right dovetail fit, we are certainly in a financial position now to act on it. It could be a Lifestyle or Performance brand. We normally like brands with some authenticity and heritage. It could have some Lifestyle potential beyond footwear. Certainly, geographic expansion opportunities are always high in our criteria list. So, as I've said before, some of the best acquisitions we've done over the years are the ones we've had the discipline not to do. And we're pretty – we have a pretty disciplined approach and a pretty successful track record over the last 20 years.

Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. And then my last question is on favorable input costs. I think during the Investor Day a few years back it was mentioned that you purchased about $300 million worth of leather for 2013. And to your point that leather prices are dropping significantly over the last six months, can you help us think about the gross margin benefit for next year in terms of leather and also potentially on the oil-based inputs?
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I mean, it's hard for me to parcel it out whether it's leather or other commodity pricings. But we could anticipate overall, this is for carryover products kind of as an example. But we could see overall price decreases in the 1% or 2% range here over 2016. When you're sourcing 100 million pairs a year like we are, that is not insignificant. And it's something, frankly, we haven't seen in a long time.
Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Best of luck.
Blake W. Krueger - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks.
