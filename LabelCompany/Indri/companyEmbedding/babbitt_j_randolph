Career[edit]
Babbitt was born in 1946 in Miami and raised in Florida.[1] He attended the University of Georgia and the University of Miami before becoming an airline pilot, flying for Eastern Air Lines for 25 years.
Babbitt's father ("Slim" Babbitt) was also an airline pilot; he was one of the founding fathers[2] of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which has become the largest airline pilot union in the United States and Canada. Randy Babbitt served multiple roles within ALPA, including Executive Administrator from 1987 to 1990. In 1990 Babbitt was elected President of ALPA and served for eight years in that position.
After leaving ALPA Babbitt formed an airline management and financial consulting firm in Reston, Virginia, Eclat Consulting. In September 2007 the personnel of this company were merged into the Aircraft Management division of Oliver Wyman.[3]
Federal Aviation Administration[edit]
During the Clinton Administration, President Bill Clinton appointed Babbitt to the FAA Management Advisory Council. While in that capacity Babbitt sat on an independent review panel advising the government on aviation safety policy.[4]
President Barack Obama formally nominated Babbitt to become the FAA Administrator on March 27, 2009.[5] Babbitt's nomination was confirmed by the US Senate on May 21, 2009; he was sworn in on June 1.[6] Babbitt succeeded Robert Sturgell and Lynne Osmus, who had both served as Acting FAA Administrator since Marion Blakey's term expired in 2007. Babbitt's FAA term was five years.[7]
During his confirmation hearing Babbitt stated:

"My number one priority is to focus on safety. This is a business where one mistake is one too many."

Drunk driving arrest and resignation[edit]
Babbitt was arrested December 3, 2011, in Fairfax City, Virginia, and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Babbitt was about 9 miles from his Reston, Virginia home when an officer alleged that he drove on the wrong side of the road. Fairfax police issued a press release December 5, in accordance with a department policy of announcing arrests of public officials. Obama administration officials did not learn about the arrest until they saw the press release.[8]
The day the press release was published, Babbitt requested a leave of absence, which Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood granted. Michael Huerta, Babbitt's deputy, immediately took Babbitt's responsibilities. Babbitt resigned as FAA administrator the next day, December 6.[9]
Babbitt's drunk driving charge was dismissed May 10, 2012, after a Fairfax City judge found that the arresting officer had no good reason, only a "mere hunch," for pulling Babbitt over. A video of the arrest played in court showed that Babbitt had not, in fact, driven in the wrong direction. In opening statements, Babbitt's lawyer challenged his client's alcohol breath test. An initial test showed a .07% blood-alcohol level, which is below the legal limit. The officer then tested Babbitt again until he got a .08% reading—something police are not allowed to do.[10]
After the dismissal, Babbitt said he planned to work in aviation consulting.
He was later hired in October 2012 as Southwest Airlines' Vice President of Labor Relations. On August 23, 2016, he announced his retirement from SWA.[11]

Name: Babbitt, J. Randolph
                        

Current Position: Previous Administrator
                        


	J. Randolph “Randy” Babbitt, an aviation consultant and former pilot-union boss, was sworn in as the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on June 1, 2009, as it began to overhaul air-traffic control equipment through the NextGen project, a billion-dollar effort to use satellites rather than ground-based radar to guide airplanes.

	 

Born and raised in Coral Gables, Florida, Babbitt, 62, is the son of W.T. “Slim” Babbitt, a retired Eastern Airlines captain, and Margaret Babbitt. He attended the University of Georgia and the University of Miami before beginning his own career as a pilot for Eastern in 1966.

	 

	During his 25 years as a commercial airline pilot flying DC-9s, he became actively involved in the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the world’s largest union of airline pilots. In the early 1970s, he served on several local ALPA committees for Eastern pilots, and was later elected and served two years as vice chairman of the Eastern pilots based in Miami. Babbitt also chaired ALPA’s National Collective Bargaining Committee and its Presidential Committee on Labor Standards.

 

	In 1985, he was chosen as the union’s executive administrator, which called for assisting the president of ALPA in a wide range of areas, including administering staff departments, acting as liaison between the national office and membership councils and pilot committees, and troubleshooting collective bargaining situations. Babbitt was in this position when Eastern Airlines went on strike in 1989—which resulted in 3,000 employees losing their jobs to replacement workers hired by the airline. Some of the fired pilots filed a class action lawsuit against the union on grounds that it failed to pursue other jobs for them.

	 

	In 1990, Babbitt was elected president and CEO of the union, serving two terms. The following year he publicly slammed the federal government’s deregulation of the airline industry, claiming the move had sent it into a “nosedive” and cost too many jobs. He also publicly criticized Samuel Skinner, secretary of transportation under President George H. W. Bush, and the FAA for failing to upgrade the nation’s air traffic control system.

	 

	In 1992, he convinced the airline pilots union to endorse Bill Clinton for president—after decades of the union standing on the sidelines during presidential races.

	 

	Six years later, Babbitt backed the decision by pilots of Northwest Airlines to go on strike, which lasted 13 days, the longest strike of its kind since 1989. The strike was the last that Babbitt oversaw as head of the union because he stepped down at the end of 1998.

	 

	Babbitt left the union in 2001 to found Eclat Consulting, Inc. to provide “economic support for regulatory, legislative, and business issues in aviation.” He sold Eclat to the Oliver Wyman consulting firm (part of the Marsh and McLennan Companies) in September 2007, where Babbitt served as partner. His clients have included Airbus SAS, Alaska Air Group Inc., AirTran Holdings Inc., Hawaiian Holdings Inc. and Pinnacle Airlines Corp. Since joining Oliver Wyman, Babbitt’s client work has focused mainly on advising airlines and labor unions throughout complex restructuring initiatives and negotiations.

	 

	Babbitt also has served as a director of Access National Bank since it was organized in 1999, and as a director of Access National Corporation (the bank’s holding company) since it was formed in 2002.

	 

	Babbitt served on the 1993 National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, which supported deregulation of the airline industry, and the FAA Management Advisory Council. In 2008 he was named by Transportation Secretary Mary Peters to an independent review team of aviation and safety experts tasked with evaluating and crafting recommendations to improve the FAA’s implementation of the aviation safety system and its culture of safety. That effort yielded the report, “Managing Risks in Civil Aviation: A Review of the FAA’s Approach to Safety.”

	 

	Industry observers say Babbitt’s first priority as head of FAA is likely to be settling a long-running battle between the agency and its air-traffic controllers. The two sides have been at odds over pay scales and work rules since 2006, when the FAA imposed pay cuts on new hires, dress codes and other workplace restrictions following a period of acrimonious negotiations.

	Another goal will be to break the political logjam blocking deployment of the next-generation traffic-control system, touted as the best cure for the chronic delays plaguing air travel. The new system isn’t currently scheduled to be fully operational before 2020, and such a long transition concerns lawmakers and industry. Airlines have balked at making expensive technology upgrades to their cockpits, saying they need more proof of future benefits.

	 

	Outside of his professional work, Babbitt has volunteered for the Boy Scouts of America National Council, St. Mark’s Church in Oakton, Virginia, and the Lake Anna Civic Association.

A judge on Thursday tossed out drunken driving charges against him. (Ted S. Warren/AP)   By Justin Jouvenal  By Justin Jouvenal   May 10, 2012  Follow @jjouvenal     A drunken driving charge was dismissed Thursday against former federal aviation chief J. Randolph Babbitt after a judge ruled that a Fairfax City police officer pulled him over without good reason in December. It was a dramatic end to a case that had led to Babbitt’s resignation as head of the Federal Aviation Administration after a distinguished career in Washington and 25 years as a pilot with Eastern Airlines. Fairfax City General District Court Judge Ian O’Flaherty ended the trial soon after it began. After video of the traffic stop was played in court, the judge said the officer had pulled Babbitt over on a “mere hunch.” The video showed Babbitt making a routine left-hand turn into a Fairfax City business complex from the southbound lane of Old Lee Highway. In the process, Babbitt crossed double yellow lines and a northbound lane, but he did not drive on the wrong side of the road as Fairfax City Officer Mike Morris alleged in the criminal complaint.  Defense attorney Peter Greenspun also said the first breath test given to Babbitt showed that he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.07, below Virginia’s legal limit of 0.08. A prosecutor said in court that later tests showed Babbitt exceeding the legal limit, but the case was dismissed before that evidence was presented.  “I’m happy to have it behind me,” Babbitt said afterward. “Candidly, it’s been a tough time.” In his opening statement, Greenspun said Babbitt attended a dinner party in Fairfax City the night of Dec. 3. Babbitt had 2 1 / 2 or three glasses of wine between 6:30 p.m. and 10 p.m., Greenspun said. In all, seven people drank less than three bottles of wine, and there was no sign that Babbitt was impaired, Greenspun said. Babbitt, 65, a Reston resident, left the party and turned on his Global Positioning System device to navigate home, but he was headed in the wrong direction when he made the left turn on Old Lee Highway. Morris pulled him over after he turned into the driveway of the business complex about 10:30 p.m., the officer testified. After the arrest, Babbitt, who was appointed by President Obama in 2009, was placed on administrative leave. Days later, he resigned.  In a written statement after his resignation, Babbitt said that his work as FAA administrator was an “absolute honor” and that he was “unwilling to let anything cast a shadow on the outstanding work done . . . by my colleagues.” Babbitt said Thursday that he was not sorry that he had resigned and that he had no ill will toward the officer who arrested him. Babbitt said he planned to work in aviation consulting. “There was no criminal activity from start to finish,” Greenspun said after the trial. “Tragically for Mr. Babbitt, [the case] became very public.”          local crime  Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.

Babbitt Confirmed as FAA Administrator




By Tish Drake | May 22, 2009			
















































J. Randolph "Randy" Babbitt, a former airline pilot and former Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) president, was confirmed Thursday by the U.S. Senate as the next FAA administrator. He is expected to officially start his new job in early June. At his confirmation hearing this week Babbitt outlined FAA’s top challenges: improving safety, air traffic modernization, reducing aviation's carbon impact and improving labor relations. At the hearing, he also emphasized the importance of efficient implementation of the Next Generation Air Transportation System “to maximize the aviation system’s efficiency.” Babbitt, 62, was most recently a partner in the aviation practice of Oliver Wyman Inc., a management consulting firm. Babbitt began his aviation career as a pilot for Eastern Airlines and flew for more than 25 years. He served as president and CEO of ALPA, the largest professional organization of airline pilots. In 1993, he served as a presidential appointee on the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry. In 2008, Babbitt was named by the Secretary of Transportation to an independent review team of aviation and safety experts tasked with evaluating and crafting recommendations to improve FAA’s implementation of the aviation safety system and its culture of safety.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
