Autosports Group



Answered by Andrew Legget
31 Oct 2016





Question
Hi, do you know when the Autosports Group is being offered for an IPO? Also, where do I access upcoming floats within your site? Thanks.


Answer
Hi,
According to the ASX website, it appears that Autosport's IPO is due to close on November 14. You can find more information about it here. I have been unable to find a copy of the prospectus at this time following a brief search which means I am unable to provide any extra information. 
As for where on our site you can find information on 'upcoming IPO's', unfortunately, there isn't a page. The ASX does provide this information on their website (here's the link).
Regards
Andrew
