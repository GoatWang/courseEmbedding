Story








Described in ancient cultures as a passage or journey...
YANATM IS THE PATH TO RADIANT SKIN THAT BEGINS FROM WITHIN.
The unique fusion of ancient wisdom, culture and cutting edge technology unveils a new path on the journey to a more youthful, radiant complexion.
In China, the tradition of consuming certain foods, such as chicken feet, to rejuvenate the complexion has been practiced for centuries. There, it's widely accepted that those who have extremely collagen-dense diets will also have beautiful skin. Conversely, in the U.S., many of our diets are virtually devoid of collagen.
Inspiration








MEET THE INSPIRATION BEHIND YANATM
Let me share with you one of our newest launches called YANATM, a truly revolutionary and highly concentrated beauty liquid that helps skin regain and maintain its youthful appearance. What's unique is that you drink a daily shot as a complement to your skincare regimen and will see visible results in no time. YANATM tastes great alone or can be mixed with smoothies, teas or mocktails. I'd like to invite you to journey down the path of true beauty that begins WITHIN, as we present a new 360 degree approach to skin health we call YANATM.


"When you have beautiful skin, it gives you the courage to face the world and relentlessly pursue your dreams. Beautiful skin is what we do here every day, and now we're offering a new way to achieve it."
JANNA RONERT, CEO & FOUNDER OF IMAGE SKINCARE










The formulation of YANATM began with Dr. Marc's quest to offer a total-body approach to the maintenance of beautiful skin. What makes this product revolutionary is the LumiplexTM proprietary blend of advanced technologies that deliver five powerful restorative compounds to increase the skin's production of collagen, and improve firmness and hydration. The results are amazing and clinically proven to help the skin Age Later®.

WHAT MAKES YANATM DIFFERENT IS THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND ITS UNIQUE FORMULATION
HYDROLYZED BIOACTIVE COLLAGEN PEPTIDES
Highly effective peptides slow the loss of collagen while simultaneously increasing the body's natural ability to produce more. In clinical studies, this bioavailable form of collagen has been shown to reduce wrinkle volume, increase elasticity and boost the skin's hydration levels in as little as one week.
VITAMIN B6
Pyridoxamine, a unique form of Vitamin B6 found in YANATM's proprietary blend, help maintain the condition of the skin by combating the damaging effects of protein degradation involved in normal aging. Pyridoxamine also helps in treating a number of skin problems, including eczema, acne, dry skin and psoriasis.
ULTRA-NUTRACEUTICAL ANTIOXIDANT BLEND
The unique blend of hyaluronic acid, green tea leaf extract, organic acai juice and organic pomegranate extract in YANATM offer a super antioxidant complex that supports skin strength and hydration while preventing DNA damage caused by free radicals. 
BIOTIN
Often referred to as the beauty vitamin, biotin protects the skin against water loss and damage from the harmful rays of the sun.
PHYTOCERAMIDES
These lipids support the skin's cellular matrix, contributing to increased firmness and hydration.

HOW TO USE YANATM DAILY COLLAGEN SHOTS
