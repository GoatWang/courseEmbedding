Outdoor Coverage and Capacity Solutions for the LTE Market
Our iRRHs are energy-efficient radio systems using leading-edge multi-core processors. They are designed
with a robust, convection-cooled (fanless), IP65 housing for use in all outdoor environments











Macro iRRH
The Altiostar macro iRRH radios are designed for use in any outdoor environment and can be mounted to cell towers, masts or even walls of buildings. These provide broad coverage to city, suburban and rural areas. These macro units provide many unique features such as dynamic receiver algorithm, accurate doppler estimation for high speed traffic and frequency selective scheduling. The hardware is designed to support all LTE advanced features.
Altiostar’s macro iRRH can be used with panel or sector antennas to provide high power, wide area (3GPP WA) coverage.





Micro iRRHAltiostar’s micro, or so-called small cell iRRHs are designed for maximizing the network capacity in high user-density urban zones, as well as providing wireless connectivity for network coverage holes (Not-Spots) that are left after the macro planning has exhausted all available sites.
This product can be placed along the streets on poles, lampposts or on walls, as coverage solution or as capacity enhancement in a HetNet architecture.
Altiostar’s micro iRRHs are capable of providing medium range (3GPP MR) coverage, using either integrated omni-directional or directional antennas.

			Solution		


Kuntal Chowdhury 


			2016-10-13T15:25:20+00:00		









Fronthaul on Any Transport
Our vRAN solution connects the intelligent remote radio heads with the virtualized compute nodes over ANY TRANSPORT. It could be dark fiber, lit fiber, WDM, FTTx, carrier ethernet, microwave, mmWave or anything else you have. Whatever transport is economically and readily available, you can use it.
That means, you don’t have to restrict yourself to small pockets of your network to run limited scale C-RAN experiments anymore. Don’t settle for co-ordinated RAN or whatever your incumbent vendors call it. Deploy a full scale C-RAN on ALL parts of your network with our innovative vRAN solution.







Carrier-Grade NFV Platform
RAN infrastructure is your most vital asset. Therefore, when virtualizing the RAN functions, a carrier grade platform that can provide high availability, ultra low latency, massive scalability and ease of maintenance is essential. That’s exactly what we have done. We have taken a carrier grade NFV platform that is built on open source, enhanced it with carrier grade requirements and implemented the software modules of the eNodeB in VNFs called vBBU. With this solution, you will deploy a RAN solution that is more robust than your current RAN infrastructure with automatic failover in seconds, live migrations, and geographic redundancy to handle any situations.


















Application Intelligence
Data consumption is on the rise driven by increasingly powerful smartphones, plethora of applications and favorable data subscription plans. Gone are the days when a subscriber will remain loyal to your network due to subscription contracts. Moreover, the spectrum required to support such increase in consumption isn’t readily available. In this dynamic environment, you need to deploy intelligent eNodeBs that understand applications and application states to intelligently schedule IP packets over the air. The intelligent eNodeB will not only improve capacity of your RAN, but also will improve user’s Quality of Experience. For this, you need a software-intensive vRAN solution.







Capacity & Performance Gain with LTE-A
LTE Advanced is essential in increasing the spectral efficiency of the LTE systems. To implement LTE Advanced features such as CoMP and Carrier Aggregation, you need to deploy a RAN solution that can provide necessary co-ordination across multiple radio heads. Our vRAN solution provides such capability for both intra site and inter site scenarios. That means, you don’t have to settle for solutions that can only provide LTE Advances benefits across sectors of a single site. With our vRAN solution, you can improve capacity and performance across 2x area of your RAN coverage compared to solutions handicapped intra site only co-ordination capability.


















Leap Towards 5G

The vRAN solution is the step towards realization of 5G vision. Software programmability of bearers as per use case is required to create 5G network slices . Moreover requirements such as ultra low latency data path can be achieved with intelligent offload of selected bearers right at the radio head. These are possible with vRAN, today. Internet of Things and the use cases of various IoT verticals will require massive scalability in the control plane. This requirement alone will necessitate use of web scale hardware and software platforms for the RAN which is what vRAN provides.







Better Video Streaming Experience
The application intelligence in Altiostar’s vRAN solution detects user’s streaming video flows over default bearer and adapts them to the instantaneous radio conditions. With integrated content caching, the quality of the video delivered to the user can be the highest possible resolution, since the flow is not contending for bandwidth in many hops between the video streaming server and the eNodeB. The application intelligence engine in the vRAN adapts, accelerates transport connection setup, prioritizes, shapes every video streaming flow that match the treatment criteria. The result is stunning video quality without stalls delivered to the users at a lower cost.










 








Connecting People with Video Calls
Nothing will delight your users more than the freedom to make and receive crystal clear video calls to/from their near and dear ones. Today, in majority of the networks, the IMS video calling and OTT video calling applications such as FaceTime, GoogleTalk, Skype are limited to WiFi access only. Altiostar’s vRAN solution is designed to adapt conversational video flows in tune with the instantaneous radio conditions over LTE. This results in support of great quality video calls without stalls and disruptions over LTE network. With vRAN solution, you can provide to your customers the freedom to use your own video calling application and/or a partner’s OTT video calling application any time anywhere.
