Adams Street Partners, LLC is an investment firm specializing in direct and fund of funds investments. For direct investments, the firm invests in growth and venture capital investments, buyouts, turnaround, distressed, mezzanine, and expansion stages. Within growth and venture investments, it seeks to invest in early stage growth companies and mid to late stage venture companies. The firm also co-invests alongside other general partners in buyout and growth equity investments in small and medium sized companies. It invests in companies that have received prior financing from early-stage venture firms and are seeking additional capital to fund product development and commercialization. Additionally, the firm seeks for investors to either lead subsequent financing rounds for their portfolio companies or to join them in a new deal. It also makes secondary investments through dedicated stand-alone secondary funds as well as fund-of-funds. For fund of fund investments, the firm invests in venture capital, growth equity, private equity, leveraged buyouts, distressed, equity-oriented mezzanine, natural resource funds, special situations funds, and secondary investment funds. Venture capital investments include early-stage venture capital funds, which invest in businesses still in the conceptual stage (start-up or seed), or where products may not be fully developed and, later stage venture capital funds which invest in more mature, yet still relatively small, companies in need of growth or expansion capital. It seeks to invest in information technology, energy and healthcare sectors. For growth and venture investments, the firm seeks to invest in software, mobile, big data, financial technology, security and health care. It seeks to invest in venture-backed companies in technology including consumer internet, software and systems and components; cloud, IT enabled services, media, clean technology, communications and components; telecommunication services; life sciences including biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, and medical devices; Healthcare IT; business services; and technology-enabled services sectors. In the technology sector, it typically invests in the last private financing round before an exit event. In life sciences, the firm invests in two primary sub-sectors – medical devices and biopharmaceuticals. Within biotechnology, the firm seeks to invest in late stage clinical trial biopharmaceutical companies, oncology, cardiovascular, diabetes, neurology, infectious diseases, respiratory, pain management, psychiatry and immunology, metabolic, and central nervous system disorders, as well as therapies that seek to enhance aesthetics and life style. Within medical devices, it seeks to invest in early to mid-stage medical device companies. Its particular areas of interest include devices that help treat cardiovascular, orthopedic, metabolic, and central nervous system disease, as well as devices that seek to enhance aesthetics and life style. Within technology-enabled services, the firm prefers to invest in information services, SAAS, communications services, marketing services, consumer services, transaction processing, financial services and human resources. Within software, it seeks to invest in database and data warehousing, networking and telecommunications equipment, collaboration, customer and partner relationship management, IC design automation and Information Technology department management, and communications software. Within systems and components, it invests in communications technology, high performance computing and data warehousing, RFID, and consumer device components. For direct investments, the firm seeks to invest in companies that are based in the United States, South America, Israel, United Kingdom, Australia, China, Vietnam, and India. The firm makes buyout co-investments in North America, Europe and Asia. On the venture and growth equity side, it seeks to take minority stakes in United States based companies. For fund investments, it seeks to invest in early-stage venture partnerships in North America, Europe, China, Israel, India, and Asia. It maintains a United States Partnership portfolio and Non United States Partnership portfolio. In the United States Partnership portfolio, the firm makes twelve to fifteen primary partnership investments during each year of a subscriber’s investment period. Over a three to four-year period, the United States strategy typically invests in 60 to 75 total funds that invest a substantial portion of their assets in North American companies. The Non-United States Partnership portfolio is structured to make partnership investments over three to four years. The Non-United States portfolio invests in six to eight partnership investments during each investment year predominantly in the growth, expansion capital, and buyouts but with increasing exposure to venture capital over time as opportunities become available. The Non-United States portfolio makes investments in both developed and emerging markets focusing primarily in Europe and Asia. The investments made over a three to four-year period. The firm expects its investment allocation to the United States venture capital subclass to be 30 percent to 40 percent over the next several years and its non-United States target allocation to the subclass is expected to be 20 percent to 30 percent. Under buyouts funds, it seeks to invest in recapitalizations and refinancing transactions. Under growth capital funds, in the United States, the firm expects its target allocation to be 40 percent to 50 percent over the next several years. Its Non-United States target allocation to the buyout/growth capital sector is expected to be 60-70% over the next few years. Buyouts broadly encompass full acquisitions, in which a controlling ownership interest in the target company is obtained, as well as non-control investments. Under special situations funds, the firm seeks to invest in mezzanine, restructuring, and distressed debt partnerships. Restructuring funds typically make new equity investments in financially or operationally troubled companies, often for a control position. Distressed debt funds purchase the debt of companies in distress with a view to participating in any increase in value post reorganization. These funds can be further broken into three strategies: passive trading, active non-control and control. These funds capitalize on opportunities generated by over-leveraged or poorly managed companies. Under the energy sector, the firm focuses on Upstream Assets with a focus on oil and gas exploration operations, proven oil and gas reserves and commodity mining reserves and operations; Midstream Assets with a focus on pipelines, terminal assets, rail and barge assets, and fuel gathering, processing and storage and Downstream Assets with a focus on the refining and marketing of gasoline and fuels, the transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas. For mezzanine, it invests in funds that pursue opportunities in the small to lower middle market sector and seek meaningful equity ownership stakes. The firm seeks to invest between $2 million and $30 million in companies that have revenues up to $20 million. For growth and venture investments, it typically invests between $5 million and $25 million in its portfolio companies. The firm seeks to invest between $5 million and $500 million in fund interests and general partner restructurings.  It prefers to act as a lead investor and seeks to take seat on the board of directors of its portfolio companies. The firm prefers to act as a lead investor in these transactions, but has no control requirements and in most instances, the lead general partner will be a majority investor actively involved in managing the company. Adams Street Partners, LLC was founded in 1972 and is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois with additional offices across Asia, North America, and Europe.
