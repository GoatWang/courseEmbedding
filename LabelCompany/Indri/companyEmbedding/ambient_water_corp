What We're About
Ambient Water (formerly AWG International) pioneered atmospheric water generation technology for extracting water from humidity in the air. Drawing from the renewable ocean of water vapor in the air that we breathe, our patented technology cost effectively transforms humidity into an abundant source of clean water near the point of use. Our scalable and modular systems can be configured for a number of water-sensitive applications ranging from oil and gas exploration to vertical farming. Our systems can also be configured to produce high quality drinking water for homes, offices, and communities. For a thirsty planet on the verge of a water crisis, Ambient Water makes clean water out of thin air. 
Click on this link to see the Channel 10 video about the Ambient Water 400 generating water for San Diego Breweries! 
Listen to The Water Values Podcast featuring our CEO Keith White.
Ambient Water CEO, Keith White, joins The Water Values Podcast for a fantastic discussion about Ambient Water’s unique distributed water solution. Keith takes us on the creative journey in which he conceptualized and tested a unit that could make safe, potable water out of the humidity in the air. After a long journey, he’s developed the technology and is now commercializing it with products that can help water poor areas with not only the provision of safe drinking water but also food supply and climate controlled shelter. You’ll be amazed with the distributed water solution that Ambient Water can provide and all the indirect benefits that result from the Ambient Water source of safe drinking water.

Water Scarcity is Our Opportunity
According to the United Nations, water is increasingly scarce and affects every continent.

By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two thirds of the world’s population could be living under water-stressed conditions.
By 2030, 47% of the world’s population will be living in areas of high water stress. Population will continue to grow. Water issues will become even more alarming.

Of the total world water supply, approximately 97.5% is saltwater. Most of the remaining 2.5% is locked in ice and snow cover. Less than 1% of the earth’s freshwater supply is available for use by the world’s population.
Water Crisis in the Oil and Gas Industry
In addition to drinking water, the demand for water in industrial applications will continue to increase alongside population and economic growth.  For example, the International Energy Agency (“IEA”) estimates that water consumed for energy production will increase to 135 billion cubic meters by 2035, or about 4 times the size of the largest U.S. reservoir, Hoover Dam’s Lake Mead.  
In Texas, the hotbed for the United States’ exploding natural gas hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) activities, serious water shortages are creating challenges for the oil and gas industry and the local municipalities. According to a 2014 report from Ceres, fracking activities in Texas consumed over 45 billion gallons of fresh water from January 2011 through May 2013, draining many of the aquifers and groundwater supplies. 





Our Solution - Atmospheric Water Generation
The atmosphere contains an untapped, almost limitless supply of fresh water that can be harvested through atmospheric water generation. Since water vapor in the atmosphere is constantly being replenished, there is no negative effect from harvesting this resource.
Our systems are designed to cost-effectively produce clean water from air humidity for various applications ranging from oil and gas exploration to vertical farming, to drinking water for homes, offices, and communities.
Why wait for the water vapor to condense and fall as snow, melt in the spring, run down rivers or into ground water, and then be pumped to you?  Why risk it being either diverted or polluted before it gets to you?

FAQs


What is Atmospheric Water Generation?

Atmospheric water generation is a technology-based process used to condense water from the air, then capture and filter that moisture into drinkable water. 



How does it work?

Ambient Water products collect water from humidity in the atmosphere. This air is chilled to the “dew point” and the moisture is condensed onto patented, stainless steel or specially coated coils, then channeled through advanced filtering chambers to provide a reliable source of clean drinking water. This technology enables significant amounts of water to be extracted from the air and purified efficiently at a relatively low cost per liter or gallon. 



Under what environmental conditions is an atmospheric water generator able to produce water?

Ambient Water's technology will produce clean water effectively and economically from the air with humidity as low as 30%. This technology demonstrates cost savings and other notable advantages compared to desalination. Optimal water generation depends on average temperature and relative humidity.  Higher humidity and temperature conditions improve the cost effectiveness of producing clean water. 



How pure is the water produced?

The water produced by Ambient Water products is 99.9% free of impurities, which means it is free from bacteria, known viruses, air pollution and metal oxide contamination. The advanced filtering process works all day and night, non-stop, maintaining an optimal level of purification. Water is channeled through several types of filters depending on the model, including an activated carbon filter, as well as the innovative HaloPure filter by world-renowned water purification company HaloSource (www.halosource.com).
Water filtered with Ambient Water's technology has low TDS (Total Dissolved Solids, which is the amount of all inorganic and organic substances in the water).
Independent accredited laboratory testing shows just how pure and clean our water is. Here is a recent report from one of our Model 2500 machines. Read Report 



What are the advantages of Ambient Water products?

There are several notable aspects that define Ambient Water as a leader in the atmospheric water generation industry. These are:

Products can run on 100% outside air, which is essential for high condensate production.
Patented and exclusive coil coating or stainless steel coils used to eliminate metal oxide contamination or bacterial deposits.
Advanced filtering technology to ensure a reliable supply of fresh, pure, clean drinking water.
Easy to use, just turn it on and open the tap to get water.
Easy to maintain, just replace water and air filters periodically per manufacturer’s guidelines and do some occasional cleaning.
Commercial and Community water units can provide scalable solutions for delivery of clean drinking water by linking multiple units to meet volume demands.
Employs a high standard of 99.9% purification of water from bacteria, known viruses, air pollution and metal oxides.
Unit performance and maintenance needs can be monitored remotely by Ambient Water (commercial and community models only).
 



What kind of energy is used and how much is required?

All Ambient Water models use electricity with one special model using waste oil as the primary source of energy. Ambient Water may develop options for using wind and solar energy in the future.
The residential Model 2500, for use in the home and office, uses 550 watts of electricity.
The power source for the Ambient Water 400 is three-phase electrical power; the unit can be easily integrated into the existing electrical utility system, using 25kW of energy. 



How much water can be produced with Ambient Water products?

Water production can range from up to five gallons/19 liters per day for the household and office models, to more than 400 gallons/1,500 liters per day for the community or commercial models, and even more through modular aggregation of these units. With the introduction of the Ambient Water 20K, more than 20,000 gallons/75,000 liters of water per day can be produced with just a single unit.  Water generation efficiency depends on average temperature and relative humidity. When humidity is high, water can be generated and stored for use when humidity is significantly lower. Tables indicating the water production rate at various temperature and humidity conditions are provided in the data sheets for each unit. 



What models does Ambient Water manufacture? How much pure water can each model produce? What are their potential uses and costs?

Ambient Water produces atmospheric water generators for household and office use, as well as commercial and community use.
The Model 2500 is for use in homes and offices with 4 to 6 people. It can produce up to 5 gallons/19 liters of pure water per day in a high humidity, high temperature environment, and stores 3.5 gallons/13 liters. It uses 550 watts of electricity. It uses environmentally friendly refrigerant r134a. It is 14.9 inches wide x 20.3 inches deep x 21.7 inches high (380mm wide x 515mm deep x 550mm high) and weighs 86 pounds (39 kilograms). A few examples of where these units can be used include homes, small to medium-sized offices and small shops.
The Ambient Water 400 and 20K are designed for outdoor commercial and community use.
The Ambient Water 400 can produce between 300 and 600 gallons/1,136 and 2,271 liters of pure water per day depending on temperature and humidity, and uses 25 kW of 3-phase electric system power. Its storage capacity is 480 gallons/1,817 liters of water.  The size of the Ambient Water 400 is 92 inches wide x 181 inches deep x 91 inches high (2,337mm wide x 4,597mm deep x 2311mm high). One unit weighs 4,757 pounds (2,162 kilograms).
The Ambient Water 20K will produce approximately 20,000 gallons/75,000 liters of water per day and is electrically powered by 3-phase electricity.  Stay tuned for more information on the capabilities and capacities of this system as our design progresses.
These atmospheric water generators present a viable solution in water-scarce communities, urban neighborhoods that lack drinking water, remote or mobile work stations (oil rigs, military bases, ships, etc.), hospitals, resorts, apartment buildings and humanitarian relief stations. 



What does it take to operate and maintain atmospheric water generators?

Ambient Water products are designed to operate continuously and only require modest periodic maintenance consisting of filter changes and general cleaning.
Ambient Water's commercial and community products have an option of remote monitoring via internet service that allows for predicting scheduled maintenance and monitoring of key operational parameters of the equipment.
Air filters should be replaced four to six times a year depending on local atmospheric conditions. Water filters should be replaced two to four times per year depending on the model in service. These cartridges take only minutes to replace using an automated system shutdown feature. Typically no compressor maintenance is required. 



What kind of warranties and servicing will be available for Ambient Water products?

Ambient Water has warranties that provide replacement of defective parts for up to one year (excludes regular maintenance items such as filters).
Ambient Water anticipates very few problems with their units as production models have passed robust testing standards. There can be issues that are related directly to the lack of maintenance, such as dirty intake air filters and water filters that need to be replaced. The units have safety features that will prevent damage to the units from operating in temperatures above 44 C (111 F) or in freezing temperatures. 



What certifications and endorsements exist for Ambient Water products?

Ambient Water products meet USA standards for environmentally safe fueling, cooling, and emissions. Ambient Water's bacteria control system partner HaloSource has approval for HaloPure technology from the USA Environmental Protection Agency for water disinfectant and water purification. The Model 2500 is CE compliant and ETL approved. The Ambient Water 400 (for community and commercial use) is CSA approved and meets the ARI 340/360 Standards for larger air conditioning units. 



How does Ambient Water provide after-purchase services in a foreign country?

Ambient Water services the residential/office units through a distributor network.  If service is required, simply contact your distributor for immediate help.
For the community and commercial units, service is available from many HVAC service companies.  Companies such as Johnson Controls can provide service including repairs, replacement of filters and other parts as well as increasing the capacity of generators through modular aggregation. At present, Johnson Controls has offices in more than 60 countries. 



How do I contact Ambient Water?

Ambient Water can be contacted at its corporate headquarters in Spokane, Washington, USA by telephone at (888) 757-3294 or +1 702 522 1621. Email inquiries can be made to sales@ambientwater.com or by visiting our web page www.ambientwater.com and selecting the Contact link. 



It doesn’t rain much here, will this still work in my location?

Our technology will work anywhere with a temperate climate and moderate to high humidity. Our systems do not need the weather fronts and mountain ranges which usually produce rainfall.
