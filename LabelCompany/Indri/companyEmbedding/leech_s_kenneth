		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund's investment strategies and portfolio investments differ from those of many other mutual funds. The manager may devote a significant portion of the Fund's assets to pursuing an investment opportunity or strategy, including through the use of derivatives that create a form of investment leverage in the Fund. This approach to investing may make the Fund a more volatile investment than other mutual funds and cause the Fund to perform less favorably than other mutual funds under similar market or economic conditions.  The Fund makes significant use of derivatives, for both hedging and non-hedging purposes, which could result in substantial losses and greater volatility in the Fund's performance.  Fixed-income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities falls. High yield bonds are subject to greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Potential active and frequent trading may result in higher transaction costs and increased investor liability. The manager’s investment style may become out of favor and/or the manager’s selection process may prove incorrect, which may have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance. As a non-diversified Fund, it is permitted to invest a higher percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund, which may magnify the Fund’s losses from events affecting a particular issuer.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate, and investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 4.25%. Class C1 shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been waived in various periods.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.


Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 


Effective June 1, 2017, the Fund changed its security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV. Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, A2, C, FI, I & IS reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Why Ben Will Remain Your Friend
Kenneth Leech, co-chief investment officer of Western Asset Management, sees opportunities in several sectors, including sovereign debt issued by Mexico and Brazil, and corporate and high-yield bonds in the U.S.

 Biography




 




July 13, 2013


The recent uptick in interest rates caught much of Wall Street by surprise, given the downward trajectory in bond yields for the past 30—yes, 30—years. Yet, sure enough, 10-year Treasury bonds were yielding north of 2.7% two weeks ago, and 2.68% last week, up from a low of 1.6% in May. The corresponding drop in bond prices has made this an unpleasant season for bond-fund investors, and an even worse one for bond-fund managers. For some perspective on interest rates and the financial markets, we checked in with Kenneth...

The Reverend Kenneth Leech, Anglican priest - obituary

 The Reverend Kenneth Leech, who has died aged 76, was unique among the Anglican clergy of his generation in combining orthodox Christian faith, high churchmanship, a deep spirituality, radical socialism and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the underprivileged – mainly in London’s East End. He was also a prolific writer.  There was nothing trendy or superficial about this. He strongly opposed the liberal theology originating in the 1960s and the more recent outburst of evangelicalism. He was a profound thinker and believed that only the inherited Catholic doctrine of the Incarnation and its sacramental consequences could sustain a Christian involvement in political and social action.  “Subversive orthodoxy” was his own description of his position. He believed that “an alliance between prophetic Christianity and progressive Marxism” offered “the last human hope of mankind”. For him New Labour came nowhere near to providing such a hope and he said that while there was overwhelming evidence of Tony Blair’s faith there was no evidence of his socialism.  In some ways Leech was a throwback to the 19th-century Anglo-Catholic priests who ministered heroically in the slums of East London and other cities and became politically radical. He acknowledged their inspiration but denied a romantic attachment to their example and was in fact driven by powerful intellectual forces. An enduring monument to his work is Centrepoint, which he founded as a Soho curate in 1969 to help homeless young people who had migrated to London. The Princess of Wales was its first patron. It is now a national charity and has so far helped over 11,000 young people.  The Reverend Kenneth Leech  Photo: St Chrysostom’s Church Kenneth Leech was born in Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester on June 15 1939. His working-class parents had no church connections but as a teenager he attended an Anglo-Catholic church in nearby Hyde.  The turning point came in 1956 when he went to Manchester’s Free Trade Hall to hear Father Trevor Huddleston, recently returned from his epic witness against apartheid in South Africa. This convinced him of the unbreakable link between Christian faith and social action and drove him in the direction of Holy Orders.  In 1958 he went to King’s College, London, to read Modern History and during this time lived with a Franciscan community in Cable Street in the East End of London, where Victorian slums remained and the friars were exercising a ministry to prostitutes. He soon became aware of wider social needs.  Leech next went to Trinity College, Oxford, to read Theology and completed his ordination training at St Stephen’s House. A curacy at Holy Trinity, Hoxton, from 1965 to 1967, took him back to East London and to a neo-Catholic church where the tradition of ministry to the poorest continued. This led to a move to St Anne’s, Soho, and what he called a “loitering ministry” on streets where social problems of many sorts abounded. The foundation of the Soho Drugs Group and Centrepoint were his response.  After four years he became chaplain and tutor at St Augustine’s theological college, Canterbury, where he was able to share his experience and ideas with a new generation of ordinands and wrote Youthquake (1973). This was designed to alert the churches to the radical changes taking place in youth culture and the rise in drug abuse. It was also widely read in the field of social work.  The Reverend Kenneth Leech in younger days  Photo: St Chrysostom’s Church In 1974 Leech returned to parish ministry as Rector of St Matthew’s, Bethnal Green, where the challenge now was the existence of the harassed Bangladeshi and Bengali communities in and around Brick Lane. During the next six years he closely identified himself with their life and came to be regarded by them as a friend and spokesman. At the same time he was involved in protest marches and demonstrations against the National Front and other extreme Right-wing organisations.  He also founded, in 1974, the Jubilee Group, which became a national network promoting the cause of what he called “Sacramental Socialism”. When a manifesto was needed he turned for assistance to Rowan Williams, at that time an Oxford college chaplain. The future Archbishop of Canterbury became an enthusiastic member for the next 10 years. The group folded in 2004 and Leech was one of its few members who supported the cause of women priests.  In 1980 he joined the staff of the British Council of Churches and then of the General Synod’s Board of Social Responsibility as a field work officer. He was also a curate in Notting Hill, an area which still had many race and poverty problems. He then spent three years, from 1987 to 1990, as director of the Runnymede Trust, concerned nationally with the promotion of ethnic and racial harmony. He commented, often critically, on government policies and travelled widely, including in north America, to give lectures.  From 1990 until his retirement in 2004 Leech was an honorary curate of St Botolph’s, Aldgate, on the border between the City and fast-changing Whitechapel. As a “Community Theologian”, financed by the Christendom Trust, he believed that true theology is produced not in the ivory towers of academia but on the streets, where Christian thinkers engage with human life and need. For Leech this involved close identification with the Muslim community as well as others “living outside the gates of affluent British life and the churches”. In Doing Theology in Altab Ali Park (2006) he provided a stimulating, challenging account of his project.  A quietly spoken, somewhat shy man, Leech could have never been mistaken for anything other than a priest. There was a deeply spiritual, contemplative element in his character that sustained his demanding ministry and attracted others for counselling and help with prayer. His publications Soul Friend (1977), True Prayer (1980) and The Eye of the Storm: spiritual resources for the Pursuit of Justice, which won the 1993 Harper Collins Religious Book Prize, were widely read.  He neither expected nor received any preferment in the Church and in the 1970s said that bishops were “state nominees, charming and pleasant, but bear the marks of the Beast”. He was, however, awarded a Lambeth DD by Archbishop Rowan Williams.  He is survived by his wife, Julie, and by a son from a previous marriage.  The Rev Kenneth Leech, born June 15 1939, died September 12 2015

       What You Should Know
       
    





            

               
       
       Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise or if the creditor is unable or unwilling to make principal or interest payments. Investments in higher-yielding, lower-rated securities involve additional risks as these securities include a higher risk of default and loss of principal. If the Fund invests in illiquid securities, it may be difficult to sell them at a price approximating their value. Foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability. The Fund may invest its assets in a small number of issuers. Performance could suffer significantly from adverse events affecting these issuers. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. The distribution amounts paid by the Fund generally depend on the amount of income and/or dividends received by the Fund’s investments. The Fund may not be able to pay distributions or may have to reduce its distribution level if the amount of such income and/or dividends received from its investment decline. Therefore, distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time. Certain market conditions, including reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, and rising interest rates, may impair liquidity, the ability of the fund to sell securities or close derivative positions at advantageous prices. For additional information on these and other risk considerations, please see the Fund's prospectus.
