Long/Short Equity Fund
When building a portfolio, investors should consider any investment that has the potential to either improve expected return without a commensurate increase in risk, or provide a similar return to that of the portfolio while reducing overall portfolio risk. Low correlation of returns between asset classes is the driving force behind the power of diversification. The less correlated an asset class is to the existing assets in a portfolio, the greater its ability to moderate volatility and reduce risk. In light of this, the primary attraction of alternative investments is the low correlation of their return with those of the traditional asset classes, and the consequential effect that incorporating them into a portfolio has on risk-adjusted performance.

Strategies 
Competitive Performance With Lower Risk 
















   
 
 
Slogan: Competitive Performance With Lower Risk 





 





Fundamental Equity
 


We offer two fundamental equity strategies: Large Cap Value and Small Cap Equity. Both strategies are designed to produce competitive results with lower than market risk.
Our Large Cap Value strategy is a traditional value strategy. Since 1990, our investment management team has customized diversified Large Cap Value portfolios with companies exhibiting high earning power, relatively high dividend-yield, and at a price advantage  to produce benchmark-beating performance with low volatility across all market conditions.
Our Small Cap Equity strategy is a fundamental bottom-up strategy. Our investment management team seeks to provide net total return that exceeds the Russell 2000 Index over long-term market cycles while producing a safeguard for investors against risk of capital loss in unfavorable markets.

Fundamental Equity ►
 


 

 






Disciplined Equity
 


We offer three disciplined equity strategies:  LargeCap, AllCap, and SMidCap. All three strategies employ a multi-perspective stock selection process that detects and adapts to evolving opportunities within the marketplace. Each of our disciplined equity strategies is systematically engineered and rigorously risk-managed to deliver more consistent excess returns throughout varying market conditions.

Diversified Balanced
 


For clients in search of a tailored investment portfolio diversified across asset classes, we combine our equity and fixed income styles to create balanced portfolios. We utilize sophisticated risk analytics and asset allocation models to ensure the portfolio is constructed and managed in accordance each client’s unique, long-term objectives.

The less correlated an asset class is to the existing assets in a portfolio, the greater its ability to moderate volatility and reduce risk.

Socially Responsible
 


We offer two approaches to socially responsible investing:  The application of socially responsible screening to eliminate investments in securities of companies whose business dealings are not reflective of our clients’ mission- or faith-based objectives; and the application of ESG – or Environmental, Social, and Governance – scores to proactively identify potential investments in companies whose business dealings are especially reflective of our clients’ mission- or faith-based objectives.

Socially Responsible ►
 


 

 






Fixed Income
 


To accommodate the wide range of income, liquidity, and risk requirements of our clients, we offer a suite of Fixed Income strategies – all consistent with our long-standing views towards investing – yet each representing a unique solution: Core and Core Plus Fixed Income; Intermediate Government/Credit; Short Term Fixed Income; and Core Government.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
