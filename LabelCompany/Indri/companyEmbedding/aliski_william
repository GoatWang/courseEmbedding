Edimer Appoints William Aliski and Wendy L. Dixon, Ph.D. to Board of 
      Directors




Company Broadens Expertise in Commercialization and Reimbursement as 
      Preparations begin for Phase 2 Trial of their Lead Compound EDI200






May 02, 2013 08:15 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Edimer Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company focused on developing an 
      innovative therapy for the rare genetic disorder, X-linked Hypohidrotic 
      Ectodermal Dysplasia (XLHED), today announced the appointment of William 
      Aliski and Wendy L. Dixon, Ph.D. to the company’s Board of Directors. 
      Mr. Aliski, a global biotech executive and orphan disease expert, and 
      Dr. Dixon, an industry veteran who has launched more than 20 
      pharmaceutical products, will serve as independent directors for Edimer. 
      With these additions, Edimer extends gratitude and appreciation for the 
      counsel provided by Dan Lynch who will now step down from his position 
      on the Board.
    


      “We are at an important inflection point for our company. We have 
      recently completed dosing in our Phase 1 clinical trial of EDI200 and we 
      will soon be recruiting subjects for the Phase 2 neonate trial,” said 
      Neil Kirby, Ph.D., President and CEO of Edimer. “We enthusiastically 
      welcome Bill and Wendy to the Board. I am confident that their broad 
      expertise and experience will be of tremendous value as we enter the 
      next phase of Edimer’s development.”
    

      “Edimer is pioneering a whole new approach for the treatment of a 
      genetic disease,” said Mr. Aliski. “I look forward to sharing my 
      experience in the orphan disease market to help achieve success for 
      Edimer and especially for future generations affected by XLHED.”
    

      “It is exciting to be part of a company that is leveraging such an 
      innovative approach to address such a severe and potentially 
      life-threatening disease,” said Dr. Dixon. “I look forward to working 
      closely with the Edimer team to deliver on this unprecedented endeavor.”
    

      Mr. Aliski has twenty five years experience in the biotechnology 
      industry, with the majority of that time focused on the orphan drug 
      market. Bill has held leadership positions in a variety of settings from 
      start-up to well established global companies, with responsibility for 
      bringing orphan drugs to market and addressing the challenges of market 
      access around the world. In the U.S., he established the first 
      comprehensive Patient Assistance Program for Genzyme to support their 
      flagship product Ceredase/Cerezyme. As General Manger for Biomarin 
      Europe, he established the company in the European Union and launched 
      Naglazyme for Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (MPS VI). More recently he was the 
      Chief Commercial Officer for FoldRx, which was acquired by Pfizer in 
      2010, and established pre- approval sales initiative for Vyndaqel in 
      Europe. Bill now serves on the Board of Directors of Ultragenyx, a 
      development stage company focused on ultra orphan diseases. He received 
      a B.S. in Economics from Boston College and a Master in Public 
      Administration from Harvard University.
    

      Dr. Dixon was formerly the Chief Marketing Officer and President of

About EDI200


      EDI200 is an ectodysplasin-A (EDA-A1) replacement protein, representing 
      the first of a new class of molecules rationally designed to correct a 
      specific developmental disorder. EDI200 has been shown to bind 
      specifically to the EDA-A1 receptor, activating the signaling pathways 
      that lead to normal development. EDI200 has demonstrated substantial and 
      durable efficacy in animal models of XLHED with notable reduction in 
      mortality and morbidity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      granted Orphan Drug designation and Fast Track status to EDI200. EDI200 
      also has orphan drug designation in Europe.
    

About XLHED


      XLHED (also known as Christ-Siemens-Touraine 
      Syndrome) is a rare disorder of development resulting from genetic 
      mutations in the ectodysplasin gene (EDA). Patients affected by XLHED 
      are at risk for life-threatening hyperthermia based on their inability 
      to regulate body temperature, and for clinically-significant pneumonias 
      resulting from their abnormality in respiratory secretions. Cardinal 
      signs and symptoms in XLHED include diminished/absent sweat, reduced and 
      abnormal airway secretions, few and often misshapen teeth, and absent or 
      early hair loss from face and scalp.
    

      XLHED patients surviving infancy are predisposed to atopy presenting 
      with eczema and asthma, chronic sinusitis, recurrent nose bleeds, and 
      dry eye complications. Almost uniformly they require dental 
      interventions including early prostheses and later implants. Their 
      susceptibility to hyperthermia, facial appearance, abnormal dentition 
      and hair loss may impact normal participation in outdoor activities, 
      sports and school attendance. Both medical and self-esteem issues are 
      life-long in this disorder. As is generally true with X-linked 
      inheritance, males are fully affected while females are variably 
      affected.
