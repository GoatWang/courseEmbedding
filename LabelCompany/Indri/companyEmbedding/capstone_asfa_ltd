Welcome to Capstone Credit Group
Starting or growing a business can be challenging, but finding the funding to make it all happen shouldn’t be.
Capstone knows there are a lot of moving parts when it comes to managing a business that will be successful. You must strategically plan your product or service, what customer base you’re going to target, what your price point will be, and how you will fund your operations. You’ll also likely have a growth plan and goals for how you would like to scale your business. Having adequate cash flow to continue to grow can be particularly challenging in the early or growth phases of a company.
Capstone is a private finance company that offers a variety of solutions to businesses to provide them with more consistent cash flow, whether it be on a one-time basis or over a short period of time. Through commercial funding loans and an array of other solutions, we can help you achieve success.
Contact us today to request funding or to speak with one of our representatives to learn more about how Capstone can help your business grow and flourish.

Our Solutions


Grow Your Business
In the business world, they say “cash is King.” Cash is King because, without it, not many business functions can move forward. There are a variety of ways that new businesses go about obtaining funds, such as through self-funding, grants, or lines of credit, but once you begin growing it can be difficult to keep up with the demands of your clients. This is especially true if you are starting off with lower limits on credit that don’t accurately reflect recent growth or growth potential. Without sufficient funds, it can be difficult or impossible to work toward your goals. Many times, competent business owners or contractors may be held back because they don’t have enough cash when they need it most. You may find yourself with a large project to complete or order to fill, but not enough resources to deliver. You may not have enough available reserves to cover necessary costs.  This can particularly be the case if the nature of your business is seasonal, such as painting or landscaping.
If you have a client whose order you are unable to fulfill because you can’t pay a supplier for the products necessary to complete the order, it can result in an embarrassing situation that can potentially damage your company’s reputation. You may lose credibility in the eyes of potential future clients if word gets around that you were not able to complete a project with fidelity. Commercial funding loans or other products from Capstone can help you avoid this situation, uphold your reputation, and grow without dealing with many of the common restraints new businesses face. When you have a consistent cash flow, your business can thrive.

Be Prepared for Unexpected Opportunities
Beyond client orders, other expenses can add up or come up unexpectedly. What if you are growing so rapidly you need to find a new space or renovate your current one? What if you need to spend extra on research and development to take your product to the next level and gain a competitive edge? You may also need to unexpectedly bring on additional employees or open more locations to keep up with demand. If you are a contractor, maybe you need additional tools or means of transporting them to take on a big job. When your growing business is already struggling to keep up with current orders, but you need these things done on top of your workflow, thinking about finances can be overwhelming. Don’t let uncertainty about where your capital will come from next limit your potential.
