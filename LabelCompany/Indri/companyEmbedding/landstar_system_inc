LANDSTAR SYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(Unaudited)  The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc., and reflect all adjustments (all of a normal, recurring nature) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the periods presented. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of managements estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary
are herein referred to as Landstar or the Company. Significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

Share-based Payment Arrangements 
As of June 27, 2015, the Company had two employee equity incentive plans, the 2002 employee stock option and stock
incentive plan (the ESOSIP) and the 2011 equity incentive plan (the 2011 EIP). No further grants can be made under the ESOSIP. The Company also has a stock compensation plan for members of its Board of Directors, the 2013
Directors Stock Compensation Plan (the 2013 DSCP). 115,000 shares of the Companys common stock were authorized for issuance under the 2013 DSCP. The ESOSIP, 2011 EIP, and 2013 DSCP are each referred to herein as a Plan,
and, collectively, as the Plans. Amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to these Plans are as follows (in thousands):

Included in income tax benefits recognized in the twenty-six-week periods ended June 27, 2015 and
June 28, 2014 were income tax benefits of $213,000 and $464,000, respectively, recognized on disqualifying dispositions of the Companys common stock by employees who obtained shares of common stock through exercises of incentive stock
options.  As of June 27, 2015, there were 94,334 shares of the Companys common stock reserved for issuance under the 2013 DSCP
and 5,555,519 shares of the Companys common stock reserved for issuance in the aggregate under the ESOSIP and 2011 EIP.  Restricted Stock Units

During the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015, the Company issued RSUs with a performance
condition and RSUs with a market condition, as further described below.  RSUs with a performance condition vest over a 3 to 5 year period
generally based on varying metrics of growth in operating income and diluted earnings per share either from a base year, being the year immediately preceding the year of grant, or year-over-prior-year growth. At the time of grant, the maximum number
of common shares available for issuance under the January 27, 2015 grant equals 200% of the number of RSUs granted. The maximum number of common shares available for issuance under grants made prior to 2015 equals 100% of the number of RSUs
granted. The fair value of an RSU with a performance condition was determined based on the 
  9 


Table of Contents

market value of the Companys common stock on the date of grant, discounted for lack of marketability for a minimum post-vesting holding requirement. The discount rate due to lack of
marketability used for RSU award grants with a performance condition during both twenty-six-week periods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014 was 7%. With respect to RSU awards with a performance condition, the Company reports
compensation expense over the life of the award based on an estimated number of units that will vest over the life of the award, multiplied by the fair value of a RSU. 
On May 1, 2015, the Company granted 20,000 RSUs that vest based on a market condition. These RSUs may vest on April 30 of 2019, 2020
and 2021 based on the Companys total shareholder return (TSR) compound annual growth rate over the vesting periods, adjusted to reflect dividends (if any) paid during such periods and capital adjustments as may be necessary. The
maximum number of common shares available for issuance under the May 1, 2015 grant equals 150% of the number of RSUs granted. The fair value of this RSU award was determined at the time of grant based on the expected achievement of the market
condition at the end of each vesting period. With respect to these RSU awards, the Company reports compensation expense ratably over the life of the award based on an estimated number of units that will vest over the life of the award, multiplied by
the fair value of the RSU. Previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed only if the employee terminated employment prior to completing the requisite service period. 
The Company recognized approximately $2,246,000 and $1,588,000 of share-based compensation expense related to RSU awards in the
twenty-six-week periods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, respectively. As of June 27, 2015, there was a maximum of $26,174,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards granted under the Plans with an
expected average remaining life of approximately 3.2 years. With respect to RSU awards, the amount of future compensation expense to be recognized will be determined based on future operating results.

Table of Contents
The fair value of each share of non-vested restricted stock issued under the Plans is based on
the fair value of a share of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and shares of non-vested restricted stock are generally subject to vesting in three equal annual installments or 100% on the fifth anniversary of the date of the
grant.  As of June 27, 2015, there was $661,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested shares of restricted
stock granted under the Plans. The unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested shares of restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years. 
 


(2)
Income Taxes 
The provisions for income taxes for both the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods were based on estimated annual effective
income tax rates of 38.2%, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Companys common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective
income tax rates for the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods were 37.9% and 37.7%, respectively, which were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment exclusion and
non-deductible stock-based compensation.   


(3)
Earnings Per Share 
Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding, including outstanding non-vested
restricted stock. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the incremental shares that would have been outstanding upon the assumed exercise of all dilutive stock options. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate earnings per common share
to the average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share (in thousands):

For each of the twenty-six-week and thirteen-week periods ended June 27, 2015 and June 28, 2014, no
options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock were antidilutive. Outstanding RSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods because the performance metric requirements for vesting had not been
satisfied.

(7)
Investments 
Investments include primarily investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five
years (the bond portfolio). Investments in the bond portfolio are reported as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Investments maturing less than one year from the balance sheet date are included in short-term investments
and investments maturing more than one year from the balance sheet date are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Management performs an analysis of the nature of the unrealized losses on available-for-sale investments to
determine whether such losses are other-than-temporary. Unrealized losses, representing the excess of the purchase price of an investment over its fair value as of the end of a period, considered to be other-than-temporary, are to be included
as a charge in the statement of income, while unrealized losses considered to be temporary are to be included as a component of shareholders equity. Investments whose values are based on quoted market prices in active markets are classified
within Level 1. Investments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active, but are valued based on quoted market prices, are classified within Level 2. As Level 2 investments include positions that are not traded in active markets,
valuations may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, which are generally based on available market information. Any transfers between levels are recognized as of the beginning of any reporting period. Fair value of the bond
portfolio was determined using Level 1 inputs related to U.S. Treasury obligations and money market investments and Level 2 inputs related to investment-grade corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and direct obligations of government agencies.
Unrealized gains, net of unrealized losses, on the investments in the bond portfolio were $262,000 and $163,000 at June 27, 2015 and December 27, 2014, respectively.

The Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of these securities as it does not intend to sell, and
does not anticipate being required to sell, these securities before recovery of the cost basis. For these reasons, the Company does not consider the unrealized losses on these securities to be other-than-temporary at June 27, 2015.

Commitments and Contingencies 
Short-term investments include $48,864,000 in current maturities of investments held by the Companys insurance segment
at June 27, 2015. The non-current portion of the bond portfolio of $57,782,000 is included in other assets. The short-term investments, together with $19,425,000 of non-current investments, provide collateral for the $61,460,000 of letters of
credit issued to guarantee payment of insurance claims. As of June 27, 2015, Landstar also had $32,763,000 of additional letters of credit outstanding under the Companys Credit Agreement. 
The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered
in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims
and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or
year.

Change in Accounting Estimate for Self-Insured Claims 
Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for
the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management.
The Company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years
claims estimates.  The following table summarizes the effect of the increase in the cost of insurance claims resulting from unfavorable
development of prior year self-insured claims estimates on operating income, net income and earnings per share amounts in the consolidated statements of income for the twenty-six-week and thirteen-week periods ended June 27, 2015 and
June 28, 2014 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 is a comprehensive revenue recognition model requiring a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it
expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In adopting ASU 2014-09, companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. On July 9, 2015, the FASB approved deferring the effective date by one year
to December 15, 2017 for annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The FASB also approved permitting early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date of December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-09 is not expected to
have a material impact on the Companys financial statements. 

Item 2. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Landstar System, Inc. and its subsidiary, Landstar System Holdings, Inc. (together, referred to herein as Landstar or the
Company), is an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to
enterprise-wide solutions to manage all of a customers transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other
countries around the world. The Companys services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by
a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Companys business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. 
Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively
utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight. Landstars independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight
available to Landstars capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Companys third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity
to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the BCO Independent Contractors), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the Truck Brokerage
Carriers), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstars information technology systems, Landstar operates an integrated transportation
management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $3.2 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the
insurance segment.  The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions.
Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload and less-than-truckload transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and
U.S.-Mexico cross-border, project cargo and customs brokerage. Industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics,
ammunition and explosives and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. Each of the
independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the
physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. During the twenty-six weeks ended June 27, 2015, revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately
46%, 47% and 3%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated revenue. Collectively, revenue hauled by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 3% of the Companys consolidated revenue in the twenty-six-week period ended
June 27, 2015.

The insurance segment is comprised of Signature Insurance Company, a wholly owned offshore
insurance subsidiary (Signature), and Risk Management Claim Services, Inc. This segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstars operating subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the
Companys BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstars operating subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party
insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1% of the Companys consolidated
revenue for the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015.  Changes in Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
Management believes the Companys success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent
commission sales agents and to safely and efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers. Management believes the most significant factors to the Companys success include increasing revenue, sourcing capacity and
controlling costs, including insurance and claims.  While customer demand, which is subject to overall economic conditions, ultimately
drives increases or decreases in revenue, the Company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities. Managements emphasis with respect to revenue growth is on
revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate $1 million or more of Landstar revenue (Million Dollar Agents). Management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to
increase both the revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents and the number of Million Dollar Agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents.
During the 2014 fiscal year, 525 independent commission sales agents generated $1 million or more of Landstar revenue and thus qualified as Million Dollar Agents. During the 2014 fiscal year, the average revenue generated by a Million Dollar Agent
was $5,609,000 and revenue generated by Million Dollar Agents in the aggregate represented 92% of consolidated revenue.  Management
monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads (volume) and revenue per load by mode of transportation. Revenue per load can be influenced by many factors other than a change in price. Those factors include the average length of haul,
freight type, special handling and equipment requirements, fuel costs and delivery time requirements. For shipments involving two or more modes of transportation, revenue is generally classified by the mode of transportation having the highest cost
for the load. The following table summarizes this information by trailer type for truck transportation and by mode for all others:

Active refers to Truck Brokerage Carriers who moved at least one load in the 180 days immediately preceding the fiscal quarter end. 
The Company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to
agents. The Company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims. In addition, the Company incurs selling, general and administrative costs essential to administering
its business operations. Management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the Company and establishes annual cost budgets which, in general, are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis. 
Purchased transportation represents the amount a BCO Independent Contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight.
The amount of purchased transportation paid to a BCO Independent Contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by delivered loads the BCO Independent Contractor hauled. Purchased transportation paid to
a Truck Brokerage Carrier is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Purchased transportation paid to railroads is based on either a negotiated rate for each
load hauled or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate. Purchased transportation paid to air cargo carriers is generally based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled and purchased transportation paid to ocean cargo carriers is generally based on
contractually agreed-upon fixed rates. Purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage, rail intermodal and ocean cargo services is normally higher than that of BCO Independent Contractor and air cargo services. Purchased
transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and, on a consolidated basis, increases or decreases as a percentage of consolidated revenue in proportion to changes in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated through BCO
Independent Contractors and other third party capacity providers and external revenue from the insurance segment, consisting of reinsurance premiums. Purchased transportation as a percent of revenue also increases or decreases in relation to the
availability of truck brokerage capacity and with changes in the price of fuel on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery.

Table of Contents
Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of revenue or net
revenue, defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar. Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with
fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin, defined as net revenue divided by revenue, on services provided by Truck
Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery. 
The Company defines gross profit as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents. Gross profit divided by
revenue is referred to as gross profit margin. The Companys operating margin is defined as operating income divided by gross profit. 
In general, gross profit margin on revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors represents a fixed percentage of revenue due to the nature of
the contracts that pay a fixed percentage of revenue to both the BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents. For revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers, gross profit margin is either fixed or variable as a percent of
revenue, depending on the contract with each individual independent commission sales agent. Under certain contracts with independent commission sales agents, the Company retains a fixed percentage of revenue and the agent retains the amount
remaining less the cost of purchased transportation (the retention contracts). Gross profit margin on revenue hauled by railroads, air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and Truck Brokerage Carriers, other than those under retention
contracts, is variable in nature as the Companys contracts with independent commission sales agents provide commissions to agents at a contractually agreed upon percentage of net revenue for these type of loads. Approximately 55% of the
Companys consolidated revenue in the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015 was generated under contracts that have a fixed gross profit margin while 45% was under contracts that have a variable gross profit margin. 
Maintenance costs for Company-provided trailing equipment and BCO Independent Contractor recruiting costs are the largest components of other
operating costs. Also included in other operating costs are trailer rental costs, the provision for uncollectible advances and other receivables due from BCO Independent Contractors and independent commission sales agents and gains/losses, if any,
on sales of Company-owned trailing equipment.  With respect to insurance and claims cost, potential liability associated with accidents in
the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim,
$250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Companys exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who
transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers
compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstars cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 
During the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015, employee compensation and benefits accounted for over sixty percent of the
Companys selling, general and administrative costs.  Depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing
equipment and information technology hardware and software.  The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of purchased
transportation and commissions to agents, both being direct costs, to revenue and indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit for the periods indicated:

Management believes that a discussion of indirect costs as a percentage of gross profit is useful and
meaningful to potential investors for the following principal reasons: (1) disclosure of these relative measures (i.e., each indirect operating cost line item as a percentage of gross profit) allows investors to better understand the underlying
trends in the Companys results of operations; (2) due to the generally fixed nature of these indirect costs (other than insurance and claims costs), these relative measures are meaningful to investors evaluations of the
Companys management of its indirect costs attributable to operations; (3) management considers this financial information in its decision-making, such as budgeting for infrastructure, trailing equipment and selling, general and
administrative costs; and (4) this information facilitates comparisons by investors of the Companys results to the results of other non-asset or asset-light companies in the transportation and logistics services industry who report
net revenue in Management Discussion and Analysis, which represents revenue less the cost of purchased transportation. The difference between the Companys use of the term gross profit and use of the term net
revenue by other companies in the transportation and logistics services industry is due to the direct cost of commissions to agents under the Landstar business model, whereas other companies in this industry generally have no commissions to
agents.  Also, as previously mentioned, the Company reports two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance
segment. External revenue at the insurance segment, representing reinsurance premiums, has historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis at less than 2% of consolidated revenue and generally corresponds directly with the number
of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors. The discussion of indirect cost line items in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations considers the Companys costs on a consolidated basis
rather than on a segment basis. Management believes this presentation format is the most appropriate to assist users of the financial statements in understanding the Companys business for the following reasons: (1) the insurance segment
has no other operating costs; (2) discussion of insurance and claims at either segment without reference to the other may create confusion amongst investors and potential investors due to intercompany arrangements and specific deductible
programs that affect comparability of financial results by segment between various fiscal periods but that have no effect on the Company from a consolidated reporting perspective; (3) selling, general and administrative costs of the insurance
segment comprise less than 10% of consolidated selling, general and administrative costs and have historically been relatively consistent on a year-over-year basis; and (4) the insurance segment has no depreciation and amortization. 
TWENTY SIX WEEKS ENDED JUNE 27, 2015 COMPARED TO TWENTY SIX WEEKS ENDED JUNE 28, 2014 
Revenue for the 2015 twenty-six-week period was $1,630,763,000, an increase of $128,123,000, or 9%, compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week
period. Transportation revenue increased $125,552,000, or 8%. The increase in transportation revenue was primarily attributable to a 9% increase in the number of loads hauled, while revenue per load was flat compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week
period. Reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk of loss is ultimately borne by Signature, were $21,538,000 and $18,967,000 for the
2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods, respectively. The increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of BCO Independent Contractors in the 2015 twenty-six-week period compared to the 2014
twenty-six-week period.  Truck transportation revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers (together, the
third party truck capacity providers) for the 2015 twenty-six-week period was $1,518,069,000, or 93% of total revenue, an increase of $108,226,000, or 8%, compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period. The number of loads hauled by third
party truck capacity providers in the 2015 twenty-six-week period increased approximately 8% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period, while revenue per load was relatively flat compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period. The increase in the
number of loads hauled via truck was due to a broad-based increase in demand for truck transportation services, particularly truck transportation services provided on van trailing equipment and less-than-truckload (LTL) loads, and
increased market share from new agents. Revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was flat as the impact of increased demand and a stable, yet somewhat tight, capacity market was offset by the impact of lower diesel fuel costs on revenue per load
on loads hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. The number of loads hauled via van equipment increased 7% and revenue per load on loads hauled via van equipment increased 3% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period. Demand for Landstars van
transportation

services was broad-based across many customers and geographic regions. The number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 5% while revenue per load on loads hauled via
unsided/platform equipment decreased 3% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period. The increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was the result of a significant award from a customer during the 2015 period along with
underlying demand consistent with the 2014 period. The decrease in unsided/platform revenue per load of 3% was primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of unsided/platform revenue contributed by heavy specialized equipment, which tends to have
a higher revenue per load. The increase in the number of LTL loads of 25% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer and increased market share as more of the Companys
independent commission agents participate in this service offering. The decrease in LTL revenue per load of 12% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer, which had a comparatively
low revenue per load. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $45,031,000 and $56,942,000 in the 2015 and 2014 periods,
respectively. Fuel surcharges billed to customers on revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors are excluded from revenue. 
Transportation revenue hauled by rail intermodal, air cargo and ocean cargo carriers (collectively, the multimode capacity
providers) for the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015, was $90,932,000, or 6% of total revenue, an increase of $17,474,000, or 24%, compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity
providers in the 2015 twenty-six-week period increased approximately 31% compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period, while revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 6% over the same period. The
increase in loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to increased rail intermodal loads. The decrease in revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to a decreased revenue per load on
rail intermodal loads and an increase in intermodal loads as a percentage of multimode loads, as intermodal loads generally generate a lower revenue per load compared to loads hauled by ocean or air cargo carriers. Also, revenue per load on revenue
hauled by multimode capacity providers is influenced by many factors, including revenue mix among the various modes of transportation used, length of haul, complexity of freight, density of freight lanes, fuel costs and availability of capacity.
 Purchased transportation was 76.9% and 77.1% of revenue in the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods, respectively. The decrease in
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a decreased rate of purchased transportation paid to Truck Brokerage Carriers, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by Truck Brokerage
Carriers, which typically has a higher rate of purchased transportation than revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors. Commissions to agents were 8.0% and 7.8% of revenue in the 2015 and 2014 periods, respectively. The increase in commissions
to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased net revenue margin on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage Carriers. 
Investment income was $693,000 and $695,000 in the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods, respectively. 
Other operating costs increased $2,841,000 in the 2015 twenty-six-week period compared to the 2014 twenty-six-week period and represented 6.4%
of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 5.6% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased trailing equipment maintenance and rental costs as the Company
increased its number of owned and leased trailers in response to customer demand. The increase in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was primarily caused by the increase in trailing equipment costs, partially offset by the effect
of increased gross profit.  Insurance and claims increased $1,402,000 in the 2015 twenty-six-week period compared to the 2014
twenty-six-week period and represented 11.0% of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 11.3% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to increased severity of current year claims in
the 2015 period, partially offset by decreased net unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2015 period. The decrease in insurance and claims as a percent of gross profit was primarily caused by the effect of increased gross
profit.  Selling, general and administrative costs increased $2,634,000 in the 2015 twenty-six-week period compared to the 2014
twenty-six-week period and represented 30.5% of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 31.9% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily due to an increased
provision for customer bad debt, primarily related to one customer, and increased employee wages, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a decreased provision for bonuses under the Companys incentive compensation
plan in the 2015 period. The decrease in selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of gross profit, however, was primarily due to the effect of increased gross profit, which more than offset the effect of the increase in selling,
general and administrative costs.  Depreciation and amortization increased $735,000 in the 2015 twenty-six-week period compared to the
2014 twenty-six-week period and represented 5.7% of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 5.9% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs were primarily due to depreciation on new trailing equipment
that replaced older, fully depreciated trailing equipment. The decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of gross profit was primarily due to the effect of increased gross profit.

Interest and debt expense in the 2015 twenty-six-week period was $8,000 higher than the 2014
twenty-six-week period.  The provisions for income taxes for both the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods were based on estimated annual
effective income tax rates of approximately 38.2%, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Companys common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock
options. The effective income tax rates for the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods were 37.9% and 37.7%, respectively, which were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment
exclusion and non-deductible stock compensation expense. The effective income tax rates in the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods were less than the 38.2% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to disqualifying dispositions of
the Companys common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options in each period.  Net
income was $70,486,000, or $1.59 per common share ($1.59 per diluted share), in the 2015 twenty-six-week period. Net income was $63,563,000, or $1.41 per common share ($1.40 per diluted share), in the 2014 twenty-six-week period. 
THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED JUNE 27, 2015 COMPARED TO THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED JUNE 28, 2014 
Revenue for the 2015 thirteen-week period was $868,383,000, an increase of $53,940,000, or 7%, compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period.
Transportation revenue increased $52,609,000, or 7%. The increase in transportation revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of loads hauled of 10%, partially offset by decreased revenue per load of approximately 3%.
Reinsurance premiums were $10,954,000 and $9,623,000 for the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods, respectively. The increase in revenue from reinsurance premiums was primarily attributable to the increase in the number of BCO Independent Contractors
in the 2015 thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period.  Truck transportation revenue hauled by third party truck
capacity providers for the thirteen-week period ended June 27, 2015, was $809,200,000, or 93% of total revenue, an increase of $44,522,000, or 6%, compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period. The number of loads hauled by third party truck
capacity providers in the 2015 thirteen-week period increased 9% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period, while revenue per load decreased 3% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period. The increase in the number of loads hauled via third party
truck capacity providers was due to a broad-based increase in demand for truck transportation services and increased market share from new agents. The decrease in revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was primarily attributable to the impact of
lower diesel fuel costs on loads hauled via Truck Brokerage Carriers and a decrease in the number of loads hauled via heavy specialized equipment as a percentage of total truck loads, which typically have a higher revenue per load. The number of
loads hauled via van equipment increased 8%, while revenue per load on loads hauled via van equipment was approximately flat compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period. Demand for Landstars van transportation services was broad based, across
many customers and geographic regions. The number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 10%, while revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment decreased 7% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period. The
increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was the result of a significant award from a customer during the 2015 second quarter along with underlying demand consistent with the 2014 second quarter. The decrease in revenue
per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment was primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of unsided/platform revenue contributed by heavy specialized equipment, which tends to have a higher revenue per load. The increase in the
number of LTL loads of 20% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer and increased market share as more independent commission agents participate in this service offering. The decrease
in LTL revenue per load of 13% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period was primarily due to increased loadings at one specific customer, which had a comparatively low revenue per load. Fuel surcharges on Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue identified
separately in billings to customers and included as a component of Truck Brokerage Carrier revenue were $22,048,000 and $29,902,000 in the 2015 and 2014 periods, respectively. 
Transportation revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers for the thirteen-week period ended June 27, 2015, was $48,119,000, or 6% of
total revenue, an increase of $8,172,000, or 20%, compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period. The number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers in the 2015 thirteen-week period increased approximately 31% compared to the 2014 thirteen-week
period, while revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers decreased approximately 8% over the same period. The increase in the number of loads hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to increased rail
intermodal loads. The decrease in revenue per load on revenue hauled by multimode capacity providers was primarily due to a decreased revenue per load on rail intermodal loads and an increase in intermodal loads as a percentage of multimode loads,
as intermodal loads generally generate a lower revenue per load amount compared to loads hauled by ocean or air cargo carriers.

Purchased transportation was 76.9% and 77.2% of revenue in the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week
periods, respectively. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue in the 2015 thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period was primarily due to a decreased rate of purchased transportation paid to Truck
Brokerage Carriers, partially offset by an increase in the percentage of revenue contributed by Truck Brokerage Carriers, which typically has a higher rate of purchased transportation than revenue hauled by BCO Independent Contractors. Commissions
to agents were 8.1% and 7.8% of revenue in the 2015 and 2014 periods, respectively. The increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased net revenue margin on revenue hauled by Truck Brokerage
Carriers.  Investment income was $339,000 and $332,000 in the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods, respectively. 
Other operating costs increased $1,738,000 in the 2015 thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period and represented 6.1% of
gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 5.1% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in other operating costs compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased trailing equipment maintenance and rental costs, as the Company has
increased its number of owned and leased trailers in response to customer demand, and decreased gains on sale of used trailing equipment. The increase in other operating costs as a percentage of gross profit was caused by the increase in trailing
equipment costs, partially offset by the effect of increased gross profit.  Insurance and claims decreased $1,537,000 in the 2015
thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period and represented 9.4% of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 11.4% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The decrease in insurance and claims compared to prior year was due to
decreased net unfavorable development of prior years claims in the 2015 period as unfavorable development of prior year claims was $833,000 and $4,856,000 in the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods, respectively, partially offset by increased
severity in the 2015 period. The decrease in insurance and claims as a percent of gross profit was primarily caused by decreased net unfavorable development of prior year claims and the effect of increased gross profit. 
Selling, general and administrative costs increased $986,000 in the 2015 thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period and
represented 28.9% of gross profit in the 2015 period compared to 30.2% of gross profit in the 2014 period. The increase in selling, general and administrative costs compared to prior year was primarily due to an increased provision for customer bad
debt, primarily related to one customer, and increased employee wages and benefits expense, partially offset by a decreased provision for bonuses under the Companys incentive compensation plan in the 2015 period. The decrease in selling,
general and administrative costs as a percent of gross profit, however, was primarily due to the effect of increased gross profit, which more than offset the effect of the increase in selling, general and administrative costs. 
Depreciation and amortization increased $484,000 in the 2015 thirteen-week period compared to the 2014 thirteen-week period and represented
5.4% of gross profit in both the 2015 and 2014 periods. The increase in depreciation and amortization costs was primarily due to depreciation on new trailing equipment that replaced older, fully depreciated trailing equipment. 
Interest and debt expense in the 2015 thirteen-week period was $5,000 lower than the 2014 thirteen-week period. 
The provisions for income taxes for both the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods were based on estimated annual effective income tax rates of
approximately 38.2%, adjusted for discrete events, such as benefits resulting from disqualifying dispositions of the Companys common stock by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options. The effective income
tax rates for the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods were 38.0% and 37.9%, respectively, which were higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes, the meals and entertainment exclusion and non-deductible
stock compensation expense. The effective income tax rates in the 2015 and 2014 thirteen-week periods were less than the 38.2% estimated annual effective income tax rate primarily due to disqualifying dispositions of the Companys common stock
by employees who obtained the stock through exercises of incentive stock options in each year.  Net income was $40,471,000, or $0.92 per
common share ($0.92 per diluted share), in the 2015 thirteen-week period. Net income was $35,925,000, or $0.80 per common share ($0.80 per diluted share), in the 2014 thirteen-week period.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
Working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities were $310,427,000 and 1.9 to 1, respectively, at June 27, 2015,
compared with $321,877,000 and 1.8 to 1, respectively, at December 27, 2014. Landstar has historically operated with current ratios within the range of 1.5 to 1 to 2.0 to 1. Cash provided by operating activities was $82,017,000 in the 2015
twenty-six-week period compared with $13,600,000 in the 2014 twenty-six-week period. The increase in cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the timing of collections of trade receivables. 
The Company declared and paid $0.14 per share, or $6,186,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the twenty-six-week period ended
June 27, 2015 and, during such period, also paid $44,794,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2014 and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 27, 2014. The Company declared
and paid $0.12 per share, or $5,420,000 in the aggregate, in cash dividends during the twenty-six-week period ended June 28, 2014 and, during such period, also paid $15,921,000 of dividends payable which were declared during fiscal year 2013
and included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at December 28, 2013. During the twenty-six-week period ended June 27, 2015, the Company purchased 1,307,154 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $84,635,000.
As of June 27, 2015, the Company may purchase up to an additional 3,000,000 shares of its common stock under its authorized stock purchase programs. Long-term debt, including current maturities, was $93,209,000 at June 27, 2015,
$18,112,000 lower than at December 27, 2014.  Shareholders equity was $469,502,000, or 83% of total capitalization (defined as
long-term debt including current maturities plus equity), at June 27, 2015, compared to $488,261,000, or 81% of total capitalization, at December 27, 2014. The decrease in equity was primarily a result of the purchases of shares of the
Companys common stock and dividends declared by the Company in the 2015 twenty-six-week period, partially offset by net income.  On
June 29, 2012, Landstar entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 29, 2017, provides
$225,000,000 of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility, $75,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees. 
The Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit, among other things, the incurrence of additional indebtedness. The Company is
required to, among other things, maintain a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, and maintain a Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, below a specified maximum. The Credit Agreement provides for a
restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Companys capital stock to the extent there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement under certain circumstances limits the amount of
such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end
of the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement provides for an event of default in the event that, among other things, a person or group acquires 25% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or
obtains power to elect a majority of the Companys directors. None of these covenants are presently considered by management to be materially restrictive to the Companys operations, capital resources or liquidity. The Company is currently
in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement.  At June 27, 2015, the Company had no borrowings outstanding
and $32,763,000 of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. At June 27, 2015, there was $192,237,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company has $61,460,000 in letters of credit
outstanding as collateral for insurance claims that are secured by investments totaling $68,289,000 at June 27, 2015. Investments, all of which are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations
having maturities of up to five years. Fair value of investments is based primarily on quoted market prices. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion on measurement of fair value of investments. 
Historically, the Company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both
internal and through acquisitions, complete or execute share purchases of its common stock under authorized share purchase programs, pay dividends and meet working capital needs. As an asset-light provider of integrated transportation management
solutions, the Companys annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailing equipment and information technology hardware and software. In addition, a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the Company
is provided by third party capacity providers, thereby reducing the Companys capital requirements. During the 2015 twenty-six-week period, the Company purchased $3,050,000 of operating property. Landstar anticipates acquiring approximately
$70,000,000 in operating property, primarily new trailing equipment to replace older trailing equipment and information technology equipment, during the remainder of fiscal year 2015 either by purchase or lease financing. In addition, the Company
has entered an agreement to purchase a parcel of land in Laredo, Texas for approximately $4,900,000 and intends to build a freight staging and transload facility on the land.

Management believes that cash flow from operations combined with the Companys borrowing
capacity under the Credit Agreement will be adequate to meet Landstars debt service requirements, fund continued growth, both internal and through acquisitions, pay dividends, complete the authorized share purchase program and meet working
capital needs.  LEGAL MATTERS  The Company
is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel,
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year.  CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents managements
estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected. Historically, managements estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct. Although management believes the amount of the allowance for both
trade and other receivables at June 27, 2015 is appropriate, a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables. In addition, liquidity concerns and/or unanticipated bankruptcy proceedings
at any of the Companys larger customers in which the Company is carrying a significant receivable could result in an increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables and have a significant impact on the Companys results of
operations in a given quarter or year. However, it is not expected that an uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from an individual customer would have a significant impact on the Companys financial condition. Conversely, a more robust
economic environment or the recovery of a previously provided for uncollectible receivable from an individual customer may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables. 
Landstar provides for the estimated costs of self-insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis. The amount recorded for the estimated
liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the applicable balance sheet date. The ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management. The Company
continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim. Historically, the Company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior years claims estimates.
During the 2015 and 2014 twenty-six-week periods, insurance and claims costs included $5,474,000 and $6,747,000 of net unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates, respectively. The unfavorable development of prior years
claims in the 2015 fiscal period primarily related to a single claim for which the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $4,500,000. It is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the
estimated claims reserve at June 27, 2015.  The Company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of
income taxes. If the Company were to be subject to an audit, it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes. Certain of these tax planning strategies result in a level of uncertainty
as to whether the related tax positions taken by the Company would result in a recognizable benefit. The Company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to such tax positions due to the corresponding level of uncertainty with respect to
the amount of income tax benefit that may ultimately be realized. Management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the uncertainty in certain income tax positions is appropriate. To date, the Company has not experienced an
examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the Companys past provisions for exposures related to the uncertainty of such income tax positions are not appropriate. 
Significant variances from managements estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables, the ultimate resolution of self-insured
claims and the provision for uncertainty in income tax positions could each be expected to positively or negatively affect Landstars earnings in a given quarter or year. However, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items,
given a range of reasonably likely outcomes, will not significantly affect the long-term financial condition of Landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION 
Management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of Landstar in the past
five years. However, inflation in excess of historic trends might have an adverse effect on the Companys results of operations in the future. 
SEASONALITY  Landstars operations are
subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Results of operations for the quarter ending in March are typically lower than for the quarters ending June, September and December. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of its financing activities, primarily its borrowings on its revolving credit
facility, and investing activities with respect to investments held by the insurance segment.  On June 29, 2012, Landstar entered
into a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement, which matures on June 29, 2017, provides $225,000,000 of borrowing capacity in
the form of a revolving credit facility, $75,000,000 of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees.  Depending upon
the specific type of borrowing, borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest based on either (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds effective rate, (c) the rate at the time offered to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the
Eurodollar market or (d) the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus a margin that is determined based on the level of the Companys Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of June 27, 2015 and during all of the second
quarter of 2015, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement maturity date is June 29, 2017. 
Long-term investments, all of which are available-for-sale and are carried at fair value, include primarily investment-grade bonds and U.S.
Treasury obligations having maturities of up to five years. Assuming that the long-term portion of investments remains at $57,782,000, the balance at June 27, 2015, a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would
not have a material impact on future earnings on an annualized basis. Short-term investments consist of short-term investment-grade instruments and the current maturities of investment-grade corporate bonds and U.S. Treasury obligations.
Accordingly, any future interest rate risk on these short-term investments would not be material to the Companys operating results. 
Assets and liabilities of the Companys Canadian operations are translated from their functional currency to U.S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense accounts are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Transactional gains and losses arising from receivable and payable balances, including intercompany balances, in the normal course of business that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operation are recorded in the
statements of income when they occur. The assets held at the Companys Canadian subsidiary at June 27, 2015 were, as translated to U.S. dollars, less than 1% of total consolidated assets. Accordingly, any translation gain or loss related
to the Canadian operation would not be material.  
Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out, under the supervision and with the
participation of the Companys management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 27, 2015 to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  There were no significant changes in the Companys internal control
over financial reporting during the Companys fiscal quarter ended June 27, 2015 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. 
  25 


Table of Contents
In designing and evaluating controls and procedures, Company management recognizes that any
disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the
cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitation in any control system, no evaluation or implementation of a control system can provide complete assurance that all control issues and all possible
instances of fraud have been or will be detected.  
PART II 
OTHER INFORMATION   


Item 1.
Legal Proceedings 
The Company is involved in certain claims and pending litigation arising
from the normal conduct of business. Many of these claims are covered in whole or in part by insurance. Based on knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, management believes that adequate provisions have been made
for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome, after provisions therefor, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company, but could have
a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year.   


Item 1A.
Risk Factors 
For a discussion identifying additional risk factors and other important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, see the discussions under Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2014,
and in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Dividends payable of $1.00 per share, or $44,794,000 in the aggregate, was included in current liabilities in
the consolidated balance sheet at December 27, 2014.  On June 29, 2012, Landstar entered into a credit agreement with a
syndicate of banks and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders on the Companys capital
stock in the event there is a default under the Credit Agreement. In addition, the Credit Agreement, under certain circumstances, limits the amount of such cash dividends and other distributions to stockholders to the extent that, after giving
effect to any payment made to effect such cash dividend or other distribution, the Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, would exceed 2.5 to 1 on a pro forma basis as of the end of the Companys most recently completed fiscal
quarter.

History[edit]
The company headquarters are in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] Landstar has been in business since 1988. Landstar currently offers scholarships and has a nonprofit "benevolence fund" to assist Landstar operators.
In January 2014, Landstar sold its National Logistics Management (NLM) subsidiary to XPO Logistics for $87m.[3] Using proprietary web-based software to provide management services for customers, and carriers NLM became the largest web-based expediter in North America.[4]
Business Model[edit]
Landstar includes nearly 10,000 owner operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The BCO's (Business Capacity Operators) are not forced dispatch like traditional trucking companies. Rather, they can choose their own loads. Landstar Agents find freight loads direct from shippers.[5]

History[edit]
The company headquarters are in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] Landstar has been in business since 1988. Landstar currently offers scholarships and has a nonprofit "benevolence fund" to assist Landstar operators.
In January 2014, Landstar sold its National Logistics Management (NLM) subsidiary to XPO Logistics for $87m.[3] Using proprietary web-based software to provide management services for customers, and carriers NLM became the largest web-based expediter in North America.[4]
Business Model[edit]
Landstar includes nearly 10,000 owner operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The BCO's (Business Capacity Operators) are not forced dispatch like traditional trucking companies. Rather, they can choose their own loads. Landstar Agents find freight loads direct from shippers.[5]

History[edit]
The company headquarters are in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] Landstar has been in business since 1988. Landstar currently offers scholarships and has a nonprofit "benevolence fund" to assist Landstar operators.
In January 2014, Landstar sold its National Logistics Management (NLM) subsidiary to XPO Logistics for $87m.[3] Using proprietary web-based software to provide management services for customers, and carriers NLM became the largest web-based expediter in North America.[4]
Business Model[edit]
Landstar includes nearly 10,000 owner operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The BCO's (Business Capacity Operators) are not forced dispatch like traditional trucking companies. Rather, they can choose their own loads. Landstar Agents find freight loads direct from shippers.[5]

History[edit]
The company headquarters are in Jacksonville, Florida.[2] Landstar has been in business since 1988. Landstar currently offers scholarships and has a nonprofit "benevolence fund" to assist Landstar operators.
In January 2014, Landstar sold its National Logistics Management (NLM) subsidiary to XPO Logistics for $87m.[3] Using proprietary web-based software to provide management services for customers, and carriers NLM became the largest web-based expediter in North America.[4]
Business Model[edit]
Landstar includes nearly 10,000 owner operators in the United States, Canada and Mexico. The BCO's (Business Capacity Operators) are not forced dispatch like traditional trucking companies. Rather, they can choose their own loads. Landstar Agents find freight loads direct from shippers.[5]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
