What We Do






Quantitative Research
We are quants.  Passion for quantitative analysis is what brought our team together. Blue Sky was founded on research and development of new ideas on products with practical application.


Our Research



ETF Sponsor
We launched a series of ETFs in January of 2017 focused on two areas:
Dynamic Beta ETF:
Designed to create smarter risk exposure relative to their benchmarks. Security selection and portfolio beta are optimized in order to maximize upside versus downside capture resulting in a more appealing asymmetric return profile for investors.
Risk Managed ETFs:
Designed to provide asset class exposure in order to manage downside risk. Asset class selection and cash/fixed income exposure are optimized in order to attempt to manage downside risk. 


Our ETFs




Index Provider
Our indices are designed to reflect innovative quantitative strategies for gaining exposure to new sources of alpha, and unique solutions for risk management. We currently create and maintain the QuantX Indices that our passive ETFs mirror. These indices are then maintained by Solactive, one of our partner index providers.


Our Indices




Separate Account Manager
We launched Blue Sky in 2013 to provide separate account solutions to institutions and advisors and their clients.  Our flagship Dynamic Asset Allocation Strategies broadly seek to enhance risk-adjusted returns in all market conditions by over-weighting risk assets in periods of market strength, and over-weighting defensive assets in periods of market weakness.


 





Investment PHILOSOPHY







“When events change, I change my mind. What do you do?”
— Paul Samuelson – Nobel Prize Winner and father of dynamic asset allocation

All investment strategies are based upon a set of assumptions or historical research including buy and hold. Economic regimes constantly change; interest rates, inflation and equity markets can move substantially up or down and significantly impact portfolio returns. Unlike endowments, investors do not have an infinite time horizon. For this reason we believe that a traditional strategic asset allocation approach based on modern portfolio theory is suboptimal. It makes more sense to adapt to changes in the economic environment. We favor a dynamic approach to asset allocation using market information to guide our investment decisions. Most importantly, we believe that a systematic, quantitative approach is necessary to avoid emotions and biases in decision-making.



We believe that an ongoing commitment to research is the foundation of our investment philosophy. It is the key to uncovering new and actionable information that can be used to further enhance existing models and to develop new strategies. 


 





The Snowflake - Simple Yet Elegantly Complex









“Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.” 
— Steve Jobs – former CEO of Apple
The snowflake is a wonder of nature, appearing so simple and yet it is deceptively complex. Its unique shape is determined by the specific path it follows when falling through the sky. No two are the same, and the number of possible different shapes is infinite. The symmetry of the snowflake has proven influential in the field of mathematics and fractal geometry.
Similar to the snowflake, we believe that solutions to complex investment challenges should be simple to understand and intuitive. They should be founded upon thoughtfully researched principles that are timeless and enduring.

Asset management




Effective asset management is crucial for any pension fund that wants to be able to fulfil its obligations in the long term. The point of departure for Blue Sky Group is the client's objectives and strategy. We have expertise with both sides of the balance sheet and are therefore able to link optimal investment results to integral risk management and up-to-date information. Blue Sky Group can advise you about the development and execution of your strategic investment policy, including the portfolio construction. The portfolios are managed by external asset managers who we select on the basis of a stringent selection process and continually monitor. Blue Sky Group has adequate risk management and control systems which are structurally embedded in our organisation. We regularly supply reports which are tailor-made to your wishes and circumstances. In that way we can ensure that you can actually assume your responsibility as required.
















Thanks to the scale at which we operate, you can participate flexibly in one or more of the investment funds which Blue Sky Group offers. 















Strategic goals as a basis
The primary focus during the development and execution of an investment policy is on making an optimal contribution to your strategic objectives. The policy has to lead to a positive investment result, outperformance and, above all, control of the coverage ratio. Blue Sky Group bases its work on the total balance sheet. The issue is then which risks the fund is willing and able to bear in the light of the goals to be achieved in the long term. 
We carry out extensive research in the form of an ALM study. This enables you to set the financial frameworks for the long-term investments and we can advise you about the portfolio construction. We also involve the agreements which the pension fund has made with the participants, the long and short-term risks which the pension fund is running and the most suitable investment options.
All this is incorporated into the investment plan which we draw up on your behalf. This investment plan also details the most important investment themes. The plan provides details on the strategic allocation, benchmarks and overlay strategies. The plan also deals with additional policy-oriented points of departure, such as securities lending, risk budget for active policy and collateral management.  Here too we focus a great deal of attention on mutual understanding and clarification so that you can take well-considered decisions.
















 



From investment plan to portfolio construction
The investment plan forms the basis for the compilation of a suitable investment portfolio. Together with you we check which choices best suit your strategic goals and ensure a proper balance between return and risk. The focus is then also, for example, on the scope, the optimal composition and the mutual balance between the matching portfolio and the return portfolio. We assess for each segment whether it is better to invest actively or passively. In addition we spread the investments so that you can benefit from the lengthy investment horizon.  
 




Critical selection of external asset managers
We select our external asset managers on the basis of their quality and background. We only collaborate with experienced teams that have a clear investment philosophy and have proven themselves to be successful. That is the basis for attaining the agreed return goals for which we select specialised external asset managers who manage the investment portfolios passively or actively. Thanks to the scale at which we operate, you can participate flexibly in one or more of the investment funds which Blue Sky Group offers. We invest in various regions, styles, market segments and sectors. 








Sound risk management
Every day we monitor the external asset managers and the total risk profile of our clients, at both balance sheet and portfolio level. Blue Sky Group has adequate risk management and control systems which are structurally embedded in our organisation. Examples are strategic risks, such as balance sheet risk, and operational risks in the event of overlays. We carry out an internal risk assessment every year. This involves us analysing specific risk areas, such as the operational organisation, the IT risk management framework and the continuity of the business operations.




Reports: customised clarity
We attune the reports to your wishes, for example as regards the frequency, the level of detailing and the graphic presentation. In the reports we will inform you, in any event, about:
the investment method,
the results achieved,
the risk management,
developments on the financial markets which may affect the investment portfolio,
the balance sheet and the development of the coverage ratio.
We will discuss the reports with you at least every quarter. During these discussions we assess the performance and the risks, and we discuss the desirability or necessity of adapting the portfolio or derivatives positions.




Asset manager code
Blue Sky Group is a member of DUFAS, the Dutch Fund and Asset Management Association. Blue Sky Group endorses the Asset Manager Code which DUFAS adopted in 2014. This code contains ten basic principles. The main focus is on putting client interests first, a sound administrative structure for asset managers and investment funds and a high degree of van transparency as regards returns and costs.
