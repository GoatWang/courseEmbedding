Karaboutis will lead Biogen's IT operations and drive its technology initiatives, the company said.
Those projects include leveraging advanced analytics to help in drug discovery, draw intelligence from clinical data and improve patient care through tools such as wearable and ingestible devices.

Before her promotion, Karaboutis was Dell's vice president of IT for the product groups, manufacturing, procurement and supply chain operations.
Karaboutis spent at total of 20 years at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors in various IT and business operations leadership positions. Dell has yet to name a replacement.

How Dell IT has changed

It is one thing being CEO of a company with best-in-class supply chain. But what happens when the business refocuses?
Adriana Karaboutis has been global CIO at Dell for the last eight months. She joined Dell two years ago having previously worked at General Motors and Ford. Computer Weekly interviewed Karaboutis at the Forrester CIO Summit in Paris, in June.

Karaboutis has been in IT for most of her 25 years in work. In her current role, she is involved in the transition of Dell from a PC supplier to a services-led organisation. She says, "In the past two-and-a-half years Dell has made over 20 acquisitions, where we have moved from a traditional computer company to an end-to-end solutions business."








In April, during its annual analyst event, CEO Michael Dell and the computer firm’s senior executive team presented Dell as a “solutions business.”
This shift has put a huge strain on the company's IT, and represents a lesson in how IT must adapt as the business evolves. In fact, from a non-IT industry perspective, the shift in focus at Dell could apply to any company moving to expand from a product-centric business to value-based services.

How Dell IT has changed
Dell once had what was considered the world's best supply chain system. Management consultancy McKinsey once pointed to Dell’s supply chain management software as a shining example of business transformation. 
Karaboutis says, "We had a wonderful set of systems that supported our ‘configure to order’ business [process]. We were able to fulfil exactly what our customer wanted, when they wanted it and to the specifications they ordered. Dell has been the top supply chain company in the world." But as Dell has now evolved to a services business, she said, "We are now challenged to build processes and systems that support solutions selling."
This has involved changes to Dell's ERP systems. When Dell only sold hardware, the products could be assigned an asset tag or SKU (stock taking unit).  So the IT systems could do a very good job of running the order processing, build and fulfilment processes for anything with an asset tag. 
"But when you turn into a company that is selling software as a service, services, subscription billing with digital entitlements and digital fulfilment, these are a whole new set of capabilities that don't have a SKU or an asset tag," Karaboutis says.
To support the changes, Dell has established a business architecture virtual team across business units to provide a blueprint of the changes that need to occur from an organisational, process and technology perspective. The company's vice chairman, Geoff Clarke, and CFO Brian Gladden sponsor the project. IT is an integral part of this team.
"It is no longer the case that the business defines and IT executes,” Karaboutis says. In fact, her thinking is very much in line with that of analyst firm Forrester,  which speaks about  “business technology”, rather than “business-IT alignment”.
According to Karaboutis, with consumerisation and the plethora of data, many companies are becoming a solutions company.
Listen to podcast:



Internships and reverse mentoring
Like many businesses Dell takes on interns each year. In IT, the interns are assigned a set of objectives they have to deliver during their internship.

However, unlike traditional intern programmes, Karaboutis says, "We set up such that the interns are actually mentoring the leadership team." This so-called reverse mentoring , as used in the car industry,  means that the interns provide insights to the IT management team that it would normally not consider.
For instance, she says, "They may provide insight on things we don't even think about, like some small nuances on usability on a device. The 'Generation Ys' have grown up with the technology. From an IT perspective our interns are a great source of knowledge."
She says the interns help her IT team understand how young people think. "The value system of young people is very interesting. They would rather have a great device and freedom to move around YouTube and Facebook, go out to social media sites and access company systems, than extra pay. They have been instrumental in helping us define our mobile strategy.” 
Examples of the ideas that the interns have brought to Dell have ranged from suggested improvements to the helpdesk to using social media to gather information during the working day: “They ask, why should I have to do 10 clicks to submit a helpdesk ticket?”
Use of social media is another area where interns are influencing the normal approach to IT at Dell. The company uses Chatter internally as its enterprise social media platform. From an IT perspective, Karaboutis says Chatter complements system monitoring tools.  “Chatter gives you pathological data, I can get system metrics [from system management tools] that show my systems are up 99.999% of the time, while on a Chatter site people are saying it is slow.”

Prior to her role in Dell, Karaboutis worked at General Motors and Ford. A self-confessed “Essex Girl”, for a brief period in her career, she was even stationed at Ford’s Dagenham plant.

Given her long career in IT, starting as an analyst/programmer to global CIO, Computer Weekly asked about the challenges of being a woman in IT.
She says, “It still is a tougher environment overall for women. Only 9% of CIOs overall are women.” The problem stems from the fact that girls and young women are not encouraged to go into technology and often they appear to be intimidated by maths and science, she says.
But she says 23% of Fortune 100 CIOs are women. “A lot of companies are trying to come to together to encourage girls and young women to enter the technology field and stay in technology. We are a company that hugely supports women in technology.”

Dell CIO Adriana "Andi" Karaboutis is channeling Steve Jobs these days, in a manner of speaking. "As a CIO, I've stopped asking people what they want," Karaboutis told an audience of her peers during an MIT Sloan CIO Symposium panel discussion. In Jobs' famous quote, the rationale for not asking customers what they want was that by the time a company builds the product, customers will want something new.
For Dell IT, anticipating what internal employees want next, rather than giving them what they ask for now, has led to a new way of working. Instead of asking business folks for requirements, Karaboutis insists her staff observe, observe, observe. Their job is to actually spend time with internal business people to see how they work, where they run into roadblocks, and how IT can help. "We stop asking and start thinking -- and [start] 'futuring,'" Karaboutis said, defining furturing by quoting another entrepreneur with a golden touch, Henry Ford: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."
In addition to being close observers, Karaboutis wants her IT team to imagine the future -- and, "surprise and delight" the business. That means surprising both internal customers and external customers. And it is happening. By working closely with the business, IT helped develop Dell's Quick Resource Locator application, which turns smartphones into QR code scanners and will also be useful to Dell's external customers.
Developing a workforce that observes and invents doesn't happen overnight, and, as she explained to SearchCIO's Nicole Laskowski in this post-MIT panel video interview, it's something Karaboutis works on every day.
I want to go back to the QR Code example just briefly. How did you make the connection that the external customer would be interested in the same product that you've developed for internal use?
Adriana "Andi" Karaboutis: We do a lot of 'day in the life' exercises. We ask, but then we just also observe how our customers are doing work. And we think, 'Okay, that shouldn't take that long.' Or, 'This process -- we've got a better way to do it. Why are they doing it that way?' We come back with a better solution our customers didn't know that they needed. And we do that internally for our Dell employees as well as externally for our customers.
During your panel discussion, I think you referred to that as 'futuring' -- or wondering what the world would look like if ….
Karaboutis: Exactly. Yes. Benchmarking is looking at what everybody else is doing. Futuring isn't trying to predict the future; futuring is trying to develop a, 'What if, you know, there was a world, where…' And you sort of shape that. That's what we call futuring.
Was that a difficult thing to institute with IT?
Karaboutis: We're still instituting, Nicole. So the answer to that would be yes, it is, because, again, traditional IT was a mindset of, 'Let's go to the business and find out what they need.' We asked them to prioritize. Then we asked them for a requirements document. What do you need, et cetera? We did away with the IT steering committee, as I said on stage, and we built the business architecture team.
Now we talk about how the input is the strategy of the company, where we want to go, and we talk about how to get there. And so we're prioritizing and doing tools of engagement, as they say in the industry, and also the applications needed for the capability of the company. But the mindset of, 'Don't keep asking, we have an opinion; we know technology better; we stay on top; put some ideas out there; imagine a world where…; do incubations and put them out there.' Those are the things that have turned into surprises and delights for our customers.
Who sits on the business architecture team?
Karaboutis: It's co-chaired by myself and another representative out of the vice chairman's office. And we have a representative from each of our four business units, our enterprise, our clients, service and software business units, as well as our functional areas -- finance, HR, legal, marketing, sales, et cetera. So you've got representation, but it's the entire company, per se, through that constituent team coming together and developing the blueprint to drive the strategy.
And who pushed for that business architecture group versus an IT steering committee?
Karaboutis: Michael Dell; our vice chairman, Jeff Clarke; our then CFO; and myself.

The steering committee should be providing guidance to ensure IT alignment with the business.  If a CIO only sees them as a roadblock or hassle, then chances are the CIO and possibly the steering committee don't understand their role.  Without integration of IT and Business strategy IT will always struggle in adding value and will generally be one step behind where they should be in terms of enabling the business to achieve competitive and strategic objectives.

Steering Committees are needed but they need more focus on what the roles and responsibilities are of the participants.  It should not be a dumping ground for requirements.
