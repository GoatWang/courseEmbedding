Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
 

At Lightstone, we believe investing in large-scale, commercial real estate shouldn’t be limited to large corporations, institutions, or high net worth individuals. Since 2005, Lightstone has offered investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate through its various public non-traded REIT offerings.
A real estate investment trust is a company that owns, and in many cases manages, income-producing real estate. Investors purchase shares within the REIT and receive a pro-rata share of income that is derived from the real estate. REITs offer distinct advantages for investors, including: portfolio diversification and income through a transparent and regulated operating structure.
Lightstone’s Non-Traded REIT offerings, include:

Lightstone Value Plus REIT, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, Inc. (closed to new investors)
Lightstone Value Plus REIT III, Inc.
Lightstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc.

The 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K was previously mailed to our stockholders on or about April 30, 2016.


	Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the exhibits thereto may be accessed online through the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) website at

	www.sec.gov

	. In addition, stockholders may request a copy of our 2015 Annual Report by writing or telephoning us at the following address: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, telephone (866) 792-8700.




	INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING


	What is the date of the annual meeting and where will it be held?


	Our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on December 1, 2016, at 9:15 a.m., Eastern Standard Time. The meeting will be held at 460 Park Avenue, 13

	th

	Floor, New York, New York, 10022.


	What will I be voting on at the meeting?


	At the meeting, you will be asked to:






	


	consider and vote upon the election of four directors to serve until our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualify; and








	


	conduct such other business as may properly come before the annual meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.




	The Board of Directors does not know of any matters that may be considered at the meeting other than the matters set forth in the items listed above.


	Who can vote at the meeting?


	The record date for the determination of holders of shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the 

	Common Stock

	), entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, is the close of business on September 30, 2016. Accordingly, any holder of shares of Common Stock on the record date is entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting. As of the record date, approximately 18.4 million shares of our Common Stock were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting.


	How many votes do I have?


	Each share of Common Stock has one vote on each matter considered at the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	How can I vote?


	You may vote in person at the meeting or by proxy. Stockholders may submit their votes by proxy by mail by completing, signing, dating and returning their proxy in the enclosed envelope. Stockholders also have the following two options for authorizing a proxy to vote their shares:






	


	via the Internet at

	www.proxy-direct.com/

	; or








	


	by telephone, by calling toll free (800) 337-3503.




	For those stockholders with Internet access, we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet, a convenient means of authorizing a proxy that also provides cost savings to us. In addition, when you authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone prior to the meeting date, your proxy authorization is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your vote by proxy to arrive late and, therefore, not be counted. For further instructions on authorizing a proxy to vote your shares, see your proxy card enclosed with this proxy statement. You may also vote
	your shares at the meeting. If you attend the meeting, you may submit your vote in person, and any proxy that you authorized by mail, Internet or telephone will be superseded by the vote that you cast at the meeting.


	How will proxies be voted?


	Shares represented by valid proxies will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the directions given. If the enclosed proxy card is signed and returned without any directions given, the shares will be voted FOR each of the four nominees for director named in this proxy statement for election as director.


	The Board of Directors does not intend to present, and has no information indicating that others will present, any business at the annual meeting other than as set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, if other matters requiring the vote of our stockholders come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the proxies held by them in their discretion.


	How can I change my vote or revoke a proxy?


	You have the unconditional right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to the voting thereof by (i) submitting a later-dated proxy either by telephone, via the Internet or in the mail to Computershare Fund Services (

	CFS

	), whom we have retained to aid in the solicitation of proxies, at the following address: Proxy Tabulator, P.O. Box 9043, Smithtown, New York 11787-9729, (ii) attending the meeting and voting in person or (iii) providing written notice to CFS. No written revocation of your proxy shall be effective, however, unless and until it is received at or prior to the meeting. Your attendance at the
	meeting without voting will not be sufficient to revoke a previous proxy authorization.


	What if I return my proxy but do not mark it to show how I am voting?


	If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying your choices, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.


	What are the boards recommendations?


	The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR each of the four nominees for director named in this proxy statement for election as director.


	What votes are required to elect directors?


	There is no cumulative voting in the election of our directors. Each director is elected by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all shares of Common Stock entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at the meeting. Any shares deemed present at the meeting but not voted (whether by abstention or broker non-vote) have the same impact as a vote against the directors. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker who holds shares for the beneficial owner is deemed present for purposes of establishing a quorum for the meeting but does not vote on a proposal because the broker does not have
	discretionary voting authority for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	What constitutes a quorum?


	The presence at the meeting, in person or represented by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast 50% of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of establishing a quorum.


	Will you incur expenses in soliciting proxies?


	We will bear all costs associated with soliciting proxies for the meeting. Solicitations may be made on behalf of the Board of Directors by mail, personal interview, telephone or other electronic means by our officers and other employees of Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, LLC (the 

	Advisor

	), who will receive no additional compensation. We will request banks, brokers, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other record holders to forward copies of this proxy statement to people on whose behalf they hold shares of Common Stock and to request authority for the exercise of proxies by the record holders on behalf of
	those people. In compliance with the regulations of the SEC, we will reimburse such persons for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares of our Common Stock.


	We have also retained CFS to aid in the solicitation of proxies. We will pay CFS a fee of approximately $33,000 in addition to reimbursement of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. As the date of the meeting approaches, certain stockholders may receive a telephone call from a representative of CFS if their votes have not yet been received. Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures described below. The Board of Directors believes that these procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that both the identity of the stockholder casting the vote and the voting instructions of the
	stockholder are accurately determined.


	In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the CFS representative is required to ask for each stockholders full name and address, or the zip code or employer identification number, and to confirm that the stockholder has received the proxy materials in the mail. If the stockholder is a corporation or other entity, the CFS representative is required to ask for the persons title and confirmation that the person is authorized to direct the voting of the shares. If the information solicited agrees with the information provided to CFS, then the CFS representative has the responsibility to explain the process,
	read the proposal listed on the proxy card and ask for the stockholders instructions on the proposal. Although the CFS representative is permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the stockholder how to vote, other than to read any recommendation set forth in this proxy statement. CFS will record the stockholders instructions on the card. Within 72 hours, the stockholder will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the stockholder to call CFS immediately if his or her instructions are not correctly reflected in the confirmation.


	What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?


	Some of your shares may be registered differently or held in a different account. You should authorize a proxy to vote the shares in each of your accounts by mail, by telephone or via the Internet. If you mail proxy cards, please sign, date and return each proxy card to ensure that all of your shares are voted. If you hold your shares in registered form and wish to combine your stockholder accounts in the future, you should contact Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, or call us at (866) 792-8700. Combining accounts reduces excess printing
	and mailing costs, resulting in cost savings to us that benefit you as a stockholder.


	What if I receive only one set of proxy materials although there are multiple stockholders at my address?


	The SEC has adopted a rule concerning the delivery of documents filed by us with the SEC, including proxy statements and annual reports. The rule allows us to, with the consent of affected stockholders, send a single set of any annual report, proxy statement, proxy statement combined with a prospectus or information statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they share the same last name or we reasonably believe they are members of the same family. This procedure is referred to as Householding. This rule benefits both you and us. It reduces the volume of duplicate information received at
	your household and helps us reduce expenses. Each stockholder subject to Householding will continue to receive a separate proxy card or voting instruction card.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	We will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of our annual report or proxy statement, as applicable, to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy was previously delivered. If you received a single set of disclosure documents for this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, you may direct requests for separate copies to Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, New Jersey 08701, or call us at (866) 792-8700. Likewise, if your household currently receives multiple copies of disclosure documents and you would like to
	receive one set, please contact us.


	Whom should I call for additional information about authorizing a proxy by mail, telephone or Internet to vote my shares?


	Please call CFS, our proxy solicitor, at 1-866-641-4227.


	How do I submit a stockholder proposal for next years annual meeting or proxy materials, and what is the deadline for submitting a proposal?


	In order for a stockholder proposal to be properly submitted for presentation at our 2017 Annual Meeting, pursuant to our current bylaws we must receive written notice of the proposal at our executive offices during the period beginning on May 1, 2017, and ending at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on June 1, 2017. If you wish to present a proposal for inclusion in the proxy material for next years annual meeting, we must receive written notice of your proposal at our executive offices no later than June 1, 2017. All proposals must contain the information specified in, and otherwise comply with, our bylaws. Proposals
	should be sent via registered, certified or express mail to: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, Attention: Joseph Teichman. For additional information, see the section in this proxy statement captioned Stockholder Proposals for the 2017 Annual Meeting.

	PROPOSAL ONE:

	 

	ELECTION OF DIRECTORS


	General


	The Board of Directors ultimately is responsible for directing the management of our business and affairs. We have no employees and have retained the Advisor to manage our day-to-day operations, including the acquisition of our properties. The Advisor is an affiliate of our Sponsor, The Lightstone Group (the 

	Sponsor

	). The Board of Directors, including our independent directors, is responsible for monitoring and supervising the Advisors conduct of our day-to-day operations.


	Our bylaws provide for a Board of Directors with no fewer than three and no more than fifteen directors, a majority of whom must be independent. An independent director is defined under our Charter and means a person who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with the Company, the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates by virtue of:






	


	ownership of an interest in the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than the Company;








	


	employment by the Company, the Sponsor, the Advisors or any of their affiliates;








	


	service as an officer or director of the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than as a director of the Company;








	


	performance of services, other than as a director of the Company;








	


	service as a director of the Company or as a director of more than three real estate investment trusts organized by the Sponsor or advised by the Advisor; or








	


	maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with the Sponsor, the Advisor or any of their affiliates.




	An independent director cannot be associated with us, the Sponsor or the Advisor as set forth above either directly or indirectly. An indirect association with the Sponsor or the Advisor includes circumstances in which a directors spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law or brother- or sister-in-law, is or has been associated with us, the Sponsor, the Advisor, or any of their affiliates.


	A business or professional relationship is considered material if the aggregate gross revenue derived by the director from the Advisor or the Sponsor and their affiliates exceeds five percent of either the directors annual gross income during either of the last two years or the directors net worth on a fair market value basis.


	We currently have four directors, three of whom are independent. Directors are elected annually by our stockholders, and there is no limit on the number of times a director may be elected to office. Each director serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders or (if longer) until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies.


	During 2015, the Board of Directors held ten meetings including our annual stockholders meeting held on December 3, 2015. The entire Board of Directors was present at all of the meetings. The Board of Directors expects each director to attend annual meetings of stockholders when possible. We anticipate that all directors and nominees will attend our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.


	Nominees for the Board of Directors


	The Board of Directors has proposed the following nominees for election as directors, each to serve until our 2017 Annual Meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies: Messrs. David W. Lichtenstein, Edwin J. Glickman, George R. Whittemore and Dov Gertzulin. Each nominee currently serves as a director.


	The proxy holder named on the enclosed proxy card intends to vote FOR the election of each of the four nominees for director. If you do not wish your shares to be voted for particular nominees, please identify the




	5



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	exceptions in the designated space provided on the proxy card or, if you are authorizing a proxy to vote your shares by telephone or the Internet, follow the instructions provided when you authorize a proxy.


	We know of no reason why any nominee will be unable to serve if elected. If, at the time of the meeting, one or more of the nominees should become unable to serve, shares represented by proxies will be voted for the remaining nominees and for any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board of Directors. No proxy will be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees described in this proxy statement.


	The principal occupation and certain other information about the nominees are set forth below.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS





	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE


	The only standing committee of the Board of Directors is the audit committee (the 

	Audit Committee

	). The Audit Committee consists of three members composed entirely of our independent directors. The Board of Directors has determined that each of our independent directors is independent within the meaning of the applicable (i) provisions set forth in the Charter and (ii) requirements set forth in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 

	Exchange Act

	), and the applicable SEC rules.


	Interested parties may communicate matters they wish to raise with the directors by writing to our Secretary at: Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, Attention: Joseph Teichman. Mr. Teichman will deliver all appropriate communications to the Board of Directors no later than the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors.


	Audit Committee


	The Board of Directors established an Audit Committee in December 2008. A copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is available on our website at

	www.lightstonecapitalmarkets.com

	or in print to any stockholder who requests it c/o Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, NJ 08701. Our Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Edwin J. Glickman, George R. Whittemore and Dov Gertzulin. Mr. Glickman is the chairman of our audit committee.


	The Audit Committee, in performing its duties, monitors:






	


	our financial reporting process;








	


	the integrity of our financial statements;








	


	compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;








	


	the independence and qualifications of our independent and internal auditors, as applicable; and








	


	the performance of our independent and internal auditors, as applicable.




	Each member of our Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of the applicable requirements set forth in or promulgated under the Exchange Act and within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Glickman and Mr. Whittemore are qualified as audit committee financial experts within the meaning of the applicable rules promulgated by the SEC. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, no member of the Audit Committee may serve as a member of the audit committee of more than two other public companies.


	During 2015, the Audit Committee held five meetings. Each of the Audit Committee members attended all of the meetings held by the Audit Committee either in person or by telephone.


	The Audit Committees report on our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 is discussed below under the heading Audit Committee Report.


	Nominating the Board of Directors


	The Board of Directors does not have a standing nominating committee for the purpose of nominating individuals to serve as directors. All members of our Board of Directors participate in the consideration of director nominees. The primary functions of the members of the Board of Directors relating to the consideration of director nominees is to identify individuals qualified to serve on the Board of Directors. We have not adopted a specific policy regarding the consideration of director nominees recommended to us by stockholders.


	In determining the composition of the Board of Directors, our goals are to assemble a board that, as a whole, possesses the appropriate balance of professional and real estate industry knowledge, financial expertise and high-level management experience to bring a diverse set of skills and experiences to the board as a whole to oversee our business. The Board of Directors believes that diversity is an important attribute of the members of our Board of Directors and that the members should represent an array of backgrounds. To that end, our Board of Directors includes directors who complement and strengthen the skills of other
	members



	9



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	and who also exhibit integrity, collegiality, sound business judgment and other qualities that we view as critical to effective functioning of the board. The brief biographies in Proposal One include information, as of the date of this proxy, regarding the specific and particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each director or nominee that led the board to believe that the director should serve on the board.


	The Board of Directors annually reviews the appropriate experience, skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of our business. This review includes, in the context of the perceived needs of the board at that time, issues of knowledge, experience, judgment and skills relating to the understanding of the real estate industry, accounting or financial expertise. The Board of Directors gives consideration to the members of the Board of Directors having a diverse mix of background and skills. This review also includes the candidates ability to attend regular board meetings and to devote a sufficient
	amount of time and effort in preparation for such meetings.


	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics


	The Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the 

	Code of Ethics

	), which is applicable to the directors, officers and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Code of Ethics covers topics including, but not limited to, conflicts of interest, confidentiality of information, full and fair disclosure, reporting of violations and compliance with laws and regulations. The Code of Ethics is available, free of charge, on our website at

	www.lightstonecapitalmarkets.com

	. You may also obtain a copy of the Code of Ethics by writing to: Lightstone Value Plus
	Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., 1985 Cedar Bridge Avenue, Suite 1, Lakewood, New Jersey 08701, Attention: Joseph Teichman. A waiver of the Code of Ethics for our Chief Executive Officer may be made only by the Board of Directors and will be promptly disclosed to the extent required by law. A waiver of the Code of Ethics for all other directors, officers and employees may be made only by our Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel, and shall be discussed with the Board of Directors as appropriate.


	Board Leadership Structure


	As noted above, our Board of Directors currently is comprised of three independent directors and one affiliated director. Mr. Lichtenstein has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since 2008 and serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Glickman, one of the independent directors, serves as the presiding director at any executive sessions of the independent directors, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The Board of Directors believes that this provides an effective leadership model for the Company.


	We recognize that different board leadership structures may be appropriate for companies in different situations, and that no one structure is suitable for all companies. We believe our current board leadership structure is optimal for us because it demonstrates to our investors and other stakeholders that the Company is under strong leadership, coordinated closely between Mr. Lichtenstein, who has over 20 years of real estate industry experience, and Mr. Glickman, who has served various public and private entities as a key executive and officer over the past 20 years. In our judgment, the Company, like many U.S. companies,
	has been well-served by this leadership structure.


	Board Role in Risk Oversight


	Our Board of Directors is actively involved in overseeing our risk management through our Audit Committee. Under its charter, our Audit Committee is responsible for discussing guidelines and policies governing the process by which our senior management and our relevant departments assess and manage our exposure to risk, as well as our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.


	Director Independence


	Our charter and bylaws provide for a Board of Directors with no fewer than three and no more than fifteen directors, a majority of whom must be independent. An independent director is defined under our Charter and means a person who is not, and within the last two years has not been, directly or indirectly associated with the Company, our Sponsor or our Advisor or any of their affiliates by virtue of:






	


	ownership of an interest in our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than the Company;





	10



	 



	 




	TABLE OF CONTENTS







	


	employment by the Company, our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates;








	


	service as an officer of our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than as a director of the Company;








	


	performance of services, other than as a director of the Company;








	


	service as a director of more than three real estate investment trusts organized or controlled by our Sponsor or advised by our Advisor; or








	


	maintenance of a material business or professional relationship with our Sponsor, our Advisor or any of their affiliates.




	An independent director cannot be associated with us, our Sponsor or our Advisor as set forth above either directly or indirectly. An indirect association with our Sponsor or our Advisor includes circumstances in which a directors spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law or brother- or sister-in-law, is or has been associated with us, our Sponsor, our Advisor, or any of their affiliates.


	A business or professional relationship is considered material if the aggregate gross revenue derived by the director from our Advisor or our Sponsor and their affiliates exceeds five percent of either the directors annual gross income during either of the last two years or the directors net worth on a fair market value basis.


	The Board of Directors has considered the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director in accordance with the elements of independence set forth in the listing standards of the NYSE. Based upon information solicited from each nominee, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that George R. Whittemore, Edwin J. Glickman and Dov Gertzulin have no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) and are independent within the meaning of the NYSEs director independence
	standards and Audit Committee independence standards, as currently in effect.

	DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION


	Compensation of Our Directors


	We have no standing compensation committee. Our entire Board of Directors determines matters relating to director and officer compensation. Our Board of Directors designs our director compensation with the goals of attracting and retaining highly qualified individuals to serve as independent directors and to fairly compensate them for their time and efforts. Because of our unique attributes as a REIT, service as an independent director on our Board of Directors requires broad expertise in the fields of real estate and real estate investment.


	Effective as of August 1, 2015, we pay our independent directors an annual fee of $40,000 and are responsible for reimbursement of their out-of-pocket expenses, as incurred. Pursuant to our employee and director incentive share plan (discussed below), in lieu of receiving his or her annual fee in cash, an independent director is entitled to receive the annual fee in the form of shares of our Common Stock or a combination of shares of our Common Stock and cash.





	Compensation of Our Executive Officers


	We currently have no employees. Our Advisor performs our day-to-day management functions. Our executive officers are all employees of the Advisor. Our executive officers do not receive compensation from us for services rendered to us. Our executive officers are all employees of our Advisor and are compensated by our Advisor. As a result, our Board of Directors has determined that it is not necessary to establish a compensation committee. In addition, we do not have, and the Board of Directors has not considered, a compensation policy or program for our executive officers, and we have not included a Compensation
	Discussion and Analysis in this proxy statement. See Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions below for a discussion of the fees paid to and services provided by our Dealer Manager, Advisor and Property Manager.





	Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation


	The Board of Directors in its entirety performs the duties typically delegated to a compensation committee. There are no interlocks or insider participation as to compensation decisions required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations.

	EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION


	Employee and Director Incentive Restricted Share Plan


	Our employee and director incentive restricted share plan:






	


	furnishes incentives to individuals chosen to receive restricted shares because they are considered capable of improving our operations and increasing profits;








	


	encourages selected persons to accept or continue employment with our Advisor and its affiliates; and








	


	increases the interest of our employees, officers and directors in our welfare through their participation in the growth in the value of shares of our Common Stock.




	Our employee and director incentive restricted share plan provides us with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares of our Common Stock to our directors, officers and full-time employees (in the event we ever have employees), full-time employees of our Advisor and its affiliates, full-time employees of entities that provide services to us, directors of the advisor or of entities that provide services to us, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to us. The total number of shares of our Common Stock reserved for issuance under this plan
	is equal to 0.5% of our outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis at any time, not to exceed 255,000 shares.


	Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to shares of Common Stock from us under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time or upon attainment of pre-established performance objectives. Such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipients employment or other relationship with us. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash dividends prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have
	lapsed. Any dividends payable in shares of our Common Stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares.


	The guidance under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code provides that there is no deferral of compensation merely because the value of property (received in connection with the performance of services) is not includible in income by reason of the property being substantially nonvested (as defined in Section 83 of the Internal Revenue Code). Accordingly, it is intended that the restricted share grants will not be considered nonqualified deferral compensation.


	We have not yet granted any awards of restricted shares.


	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance


	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires each director, officer and individual beneficially owning more than 10% of our Common Stock to file initial statements of beneficial ownership (Form 3) and statements of changes in beneficial ownership (Forms 4 and 5) of our Common Stock with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all such forms they file. Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us during and with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, or written representations
	that no additional forms were required, we believe that all of our officers and directors and persons that beneficially own more than 10% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock complied with these filing requirements in 2015.

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	David Lichtenstein serves as the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer and our President. Our Advisor, Beacon Property Management, LLC, Paragon Retail Property Management LLC (

	Paragon

	), which previously operated under the name Prime Retail Property Management, LLC (collectively, our 

	Property Manager

	) are majority owned and controlled subsidiaries of our Sponsor, The Lightstone Group, which is majority owned by Mr. Lichtenstein. On February 17, 2009, we entered into agreements with our Advisor and Property Manager to pay certain fees, as described below, in
	exchange for services performed by these and other affiliated entities. As the indirect owner of those entities, Mr. Lichtenstein benefits from fees and other compensation that they receive pursuant to these agreements.


	Effective September 27, 2012, Orchard Securities, LLC (Orchard Securities) became the Dealer Manager of the Companys Follow-On Offering. Orchard Securities also opened a branch office that does business as Lightstone Capital Markets and focuses primarily on distributing interests in programs sponsored by our Sponsor.


	Property Manager


	We pay our Property Manager a monthly management fee of up to 5% of the gross revenues from our residential, lodging and retail properties. In addition, for the management and leasing of our office and industrial properties, we pay to our Property Manager property management and leasing fees of up to 4.5% of gross revenues from our office and industrial properties. We may pay our Property Manager a separate fee for the one-time initial rent-up or leasing-up of newly constructed office and industrial properties in an amount not to exceed the fee customarily charged in arms length transactions by others rendering similar
	services in the same geographic area for similar properties as determined by a survey of brokers and agents in such area.


	Notwithstanding the foregoing, our property managers are entitled to receive higher fees in the event our property managers demonstrate to the satisfaction of a majority of the directors (including a majority of the independent directors) that a higher competitive fee is justified for the services rendered. Our Property Manager will also be paid a monthly fee for any extra services equal to no more than that which would be payable to an unrelated party providing the services. The actual amounts of these fees are dependent upon results of operations and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time.


	We have not incurred any fees to the Property Manager for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.


	Dealer Manager


	During our initial public offering, we paid the Dealer Manager selling commissions of up to 7% of gross offering proceeds, before reallowance of commissions earned by participating broker-dealers. The Dealer Manager expects to reallow 100% of commissions earned for those transactions that involve participating broker-dealers. We also pay to our Dealer Manager a dealer manager fee of up to 3% of gross offering proceeds, or approximately $9,000,000, if the maximum offering is sold, before reallowance to participating broker-dealers. Our Dealer Manager, in its sole discretion, may reallow a portion of its dealer manager fee of up
	to 3% of the gross offering proceeds to be paid to such participating broker-dealers. Total fees paid to our Dealer Manager were $8.9 million in 2014. No fees were paid to our Dealer Manager in 2015.


	Advisor


	We pay our Advisor an acquisition fee equal to 0.95% of the gross contractual purchase price (including any mortgage assumed) of each property purchased and reimburse our Advisor for expenses that it incurs in connection with the purchase of a property. We anticipate that acquisition expenses will be 0.45% of a propertys purchase price, and acquisition fees and expenses are capped at 5% of the gross contract purchase price of a property. However, $11.3 million may be paid as an acquisition fee and for the reimbursement of acquisition expenses if the maximum offering was sold, assuming aggregate long-term permanent
	leverage of approximately 75%. The Advisor is also paid an advisor asset management fee of 0.95% of our average invested assets and we reimburse some expenses of the Advisor. Total fees paid to the Advisor for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $2.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively.

	TABLE OF CONTENTS



	Commencing with the quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Advisor has elected to waive or reduce its quarterly asset management fee to the extent our non-GAAP measure modified funds from operations available, or MFFO, as defined by the Investment Program Association, or IPA, for the preceding twelve months period ending on the last day of the current quarter is less than the distributions declared with respect to the same twelve month period. As a result, asset management fees of $0.8 million were waived by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2014. No asset management fees were waived in 2015.


	Sponsor


	The Sponsor has agreed to purchase subordinated profits interests in the Companys operating partnership semiannually at a price of $100,000 per $1,000,000 in subscriptions until the maximum offering is achieved. The Sponsor may elect to purchase subordinated profits interests with cash or contributions of interests in real property. The proceeds received from the cash sale of subordinated profits interests will be used to offset amounts paid by the Company for the dealer manager fees, selling commissions and other offering costs.


	As the sole member of our Sponsor, which wholly owns Lightstone SLP II, LLC, Mr. Lichtenstein is the indirect, beneficial owner of such subordinated profits interests and will thus receive an indirect benefit from any distributions made in respect thereof.


	These subordinated profits interests will entitle Lightstone SLP II, LLC to a portion of any regular and liquidation distributions that we make to stockholders, but only after stockholders have received a stated preferred return. Although the actual amounts are dependent upon results of operations and, therefore, cannot be determined at the present time, distributions to Lightstone SLP II, LLC, as holder of the subordinated profits interests, could be substantial.


	Acquisitions and Investments in Entities Affiliated with Sponsor



	Brownmill LLC



	During 2010, 2011 and 2012, our Sponsor contributed to our operating partnership an approximate aggregate 48.6% equity interest (34.4%, 5.6% and 8.6% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively) in Brownmill LLC (Brownmill) in order to fulfill its semi-annual commitment to purchase Subordinated Profits Interests with cash or contributed property. In exchange, the Company issued an aggregate of 48 units (33, 6 and 9 in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively) of Subordinated Profits Interests, at $100,000 per unit (at an aggregate total value of $4.8 million, of which $3.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.9 million were in 2010,
	2011 and 2012, respectively), to Lightstone SLP II LLC. Our 48.6% aggregate interest in Brownmill is a non-managing interest. An affiliate of our Sponsor is the majority owner and manager of Brownmill. Affiliates of our Sponsor own the remaining 51.4% interest in Brownmill. Profit and cash distributions are allocated in accordance with each investors ownership percentage. We account for our on investment in Brownmill in accordance with the equity method of accounting.



	Hotel Acquisitions



	On January 19, 2015, the Companys board of directors provided approval for the Company to form a joint venture (the Joint Venture) with Lightstone I and for the Joint Venture to acquire Lightstone Is membership interest in up to 11 limited service hotels (the LVP REIT Hotels). The Companys Advisor elected to waive the acquisition fee associated with this transaction.


	On January 29, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to form the Joint Venture with Lightstone I whereby the Company and Lightstone I have 97.5% and 2.5% membership interests in the Joint Venture, respectively. The Company is the managing member. Each member may receive distributions and make future capital contributions based upon its respective ownership percentage, as required.


	On January 29, 2015, the Company, through the Joint Venture, completed the acquisition of 100% membership interest in a portfolio of five limited service hotels (the Hotel I Portfolio) for approximately $64.6 million, excluding transaction costs. The five limited service hotels included in the Hotel I Portfolio are as follows:

In connection with the acquisition of the Hotel II Portfolio, the Joint Venture, through subsidiaries, assumed approximately $15.1 million of debt and paid approximately $12.9 million from cash contributed by the Joint Venture members based upon their respective ownership percentages (the Company $12.6 million and Lightstone I $0.3 million.)

	Other Related Party Transactions


	From time to time, the Company purchases title insurance from an agent in which our Sponsor owns a 50% limited partnership interest. Because this title insurance agent receives significant fees for providing title insurance, our Advisor may face a conflict of interest when considering the terms of purchasing title insurance from this agent. However, prior to the purchase by the Company of any title insurance, an independent title consultant with more than 25 years of experience in the title insurance industry reviews the transaction, and performs market research and competitive analysis on our behalf. This process results in
	terms similar to those that would be negotiated at an arms-length basis. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company has approximately $44,000 in fees associated with this title insurance agent. No fees associated with this title insurance agent were paid in 2015.

	Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons


	Our Charter generally requires that any transactions between us and our Sponsor, our Advisor, our directors, or their affiliates must be approved by a majority of our directors (including a majority of Independent Directors) not otherwise interested in the transaction. In addition, our Board of Directors has adopted a policy relating to the review, approval and ratification of transactions with related persons. This policy applies to any transaction, the amount of which exceeds $120,000, between us and any person who is a director, executive officer or the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities.
	Any such related person transaction is subject to approval by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will decide whether or not to approve a related party transaction and will generally approve only those transactions that do not create a conflict of interest. The Board of Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) has approved the transactions disclosed in this section titled Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.

	INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS REPORT


	To the Stockholders of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc.:



	We have reviewed the Companys policies and determined that they are in the best interest of the Companys stockholders. Set forth below is a discussion of the basis for that determination.



	General



	The Companys primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk. The Company intends to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties.




	The Company intends to acquire residential and commercial properties as well as mortgage type securities. The Companys acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. The Company expects that its commercial holdings will consist of retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), lodging (primarily extended stay hotels), industrial and office properties and that the Companys residential properties will be principally comprised of Class B multi-family complexes.




	The following is descriptive of the Companys investment objectives and policies:







	



	Reflecting a flexible operating style, the Companys portfolio is likely to be diverse and include properties of different types (such as retail, office, industrial and residential properties); both passive and active investments; and joint venture transactions. The portfolio is likely to be determined largely by the purchase opportunities that the market offers, whether on an upward or downward trend. This is in contrast to those funds that are more likely to hold investments of a single type, usually as outlined in their charters.









	



	The Company may invest in properties that are not sold through conventional marketing and auction processes. The Companys investments may be at a dollar cost level lower than levels that attract those funds that hold investments of a single type.









	



	The Company may be more likely to make investments that are in need of rehabilitation, redirection, remarketing and/or additional capital investment.









	



	The Company may place major emphasis on a bargain element in its purchases, and often on the individual circumstances and motivations of the sellers. The Company will search for bargains that become available due to circumstances that occur when real estate cannot support the mortgages securing the property.









	



	The Company intends to pursue returns in excess of the returns targeted by real estate investors who target a single type of property investment.









	



	The Company may diversify its portfolio by investing up to 20% of its net assets in collateralized debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured, directly or indirectly, by the same types of properties which it may acquire.





	Financing Policies



	The Company intends to utilize leverage to acquire its properties. The number of different properties the Company will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to the Company, the Company may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time. There is no limitation on the amount the Company may invest in any single property or on the amount the Company can borrow for the
	purchase of any property.




	The Company intends to limit its aggregate long-term permanent borrowings to 75% of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to the Companys stockholders. The Company may also incur short-term indebtedness, having a maturity of two years or less. By operating on a leveraged basis, the Company will have more funds available for investment in properties. This will allow the Company to make more

	TABLE OF CONTENTS




	investments than would otherwise be possible, resulting in a more diversified portfolio. Although the Companys liability for the repayment of indebtedness is expected to be limited to the value of the property securing the liability and the rents or profits derived therefrom, the Companys use of leveraging increases the risk of default on the mortgage payments and a resulting foreclosure of a particular property. To the extent that the Company does not obtain mortgage loans on the Companys properties, the Companys ability to acquire additional properties will be restricted. The Company will endeavor
	to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available.



	Policy on Sale or Disposition of Properties



	The Companys board of directors will determine whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of after considering the relevant factors, including performance or projected performance of the property and market conditions, with a view toward achieving its principal investment objectives.




	The Company currently intends to hold its properties for a minimum of seven to ten years prior to selling them. After seven to ten years, the Companys board of directors may decide to liquidate the Company, list its shares on a national stock exchange, sell its properties individually or merge or otherwise consolidate the Company with a publicly-traded REIT. Alternatively, the Company may merge with, or otherwise be acquired by, the Sponsor or its affiliates. The Company may, however, sell properties prior to such time and if so, may invest the proceeds from any sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of its
	properties into additional properties. Alternatively, the Company may use these proceeds to fund maintenance or repair of existing properties or to increase reserves for such purposes. The Company may choose to reinvest the proceeds from the sale, financing and refinancing of its properties to increase its real estate assets and its net income. Notwithstanding this policy, the board of directors, in its discretion, may distribute all or part of the proceeds from the sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of all or any of the Companys properties to the Companys stockholders. In determining whether to distribute these proceeds to stockholders, the board of directors will consider, among other factors, the desirability of properties available for purchase, real estate market conditions, the likelihood of the listing of the Companys shares on a national securities exchange and compliance with the applicable requirements under federal income tax laws.




	When the Company sells a property, it intends to obtain an all-cash sale price. However, the Company may take a purchase money obligation secured by a mortgage on the property as partial payment, and there are no limitations or restrictions on the Companys ability to take such purchase money obligations. The terms of payment to the Company will be affected by custom in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then prevailing economic conditions. If the Company receives notes and other property instead of cash from sales, these proceeds, other than any interest payable on these proceeds, will not be
	available for distributions until and to the extent the notes or other property are actually paid, sold, refinanced or otherwise disposed. Therefore, the distribution of the proceeds of a sale to the stockholders may be delayed until that time. In these cases, the Company will receive payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. and Subsidiaries and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms "we," "our" and "us" refer to Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LP and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which we collectively refer to as the "Operating Partnership". Dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except per share data and where indicated in millions.  Forward-Looking Statements  Certain information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains, and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), contain or will contain, forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, including, among others, statements regarding our possible or assumed future results of our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives, are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "seeks," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Such statements are based on assumptions and expectations which may not be realized and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated. Future events and actual results, financial and otherwise, may differ from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and other factors that might cause differences, some of which could be material, include, but are not limited to, economic and market conditions, competition, tenant or joint venture partner(s) bankruptcies, our lack of operating history, the availability of cash flows from operations to pay distributions, changes in governmental, tax, real estate and zoning laws and regulations, failure to increase tenant occupancy and operating income, rejection of leases by tenants in bankruptcy, financing and development risks, construction and lease-up delays, cost overruns, the level and volatility of interest rates, the rate of revenue increases versus expense increases, the financial stability of various tenants and industries, the failure of the Company to make additional investments in real estate properties, the failure to upgrade our tenant mix, restrictions in current financing arrangements, the failure to fully recover tenant obligations for common area maintenance, insurance, taxes and other property expenses, the failure of the Company to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), the failure to refinance debt at favorable terms and conditions, an increase in impairment charges, loss of key personnel, failure to achieve earnings/funds from operations targets or estimates, conflicts of interest with the Advisor and the Sponsor and their affiliates, failure of joint venture relationships, significant costs related to environmental issues as well as other risks listed from time to time in this Form 10-Q, our Form 10-K, our Registration Statements on Form S-11, as the same may be amended and supplemented from time to time, and in the Company's other reports filed with the SEC.  We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time unless required by law.  Overview  Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the "Lightstone REIT II") and Lightstone Value Plus REIT II, LP, (the "Operating Partnership") and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the ''Company'' and the use of ''we,'' ''our,'' ''us'' or similar pronouns refers to the Lightstone REIT II, its Operating Partnership or the Company as required by the context in which such pronoun is used.  Lightstone REIT II intends to continue to acquire and operate commercial, residential and hospitality properties, principally in North America. Principally through the Operating Partnership, our future acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties. We expect that our commercial holdings will consist of retail (primarily multi-tenanted shopping centers), lodging, industrial and office properties and that our residential properties will be located either in or near major metropolitan areas.  The primary source of capital required to fund our future purchases of real estate and/or real estate related investments will principally come from the remaining uninvested proceeds from our public offering of shares of our common stock and from any indebtedness that we may incur either in connection with the acquisition of any real estate and real estate related investments or thereafter.  The Company's registration statement on Form S-11, pursuant to which it offered to sell a maximum of 51,000,000 shares of its common stock (exclusive of 6,500,000 shares which were available pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP"), and 255,000 shares which were reserved for issuance under its Employee and Director Incentive Restricted Share Plan), at a price of $10.00 per share (subject to certain volume discounts), was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933 on February 17, 2009, and on April 24, 2009 the Company commenced its initial public offering of common stock (the "Offering"). The Offering terminated on August 15, 2012.  The Company filed a registration statement on Form S-11 (the "Follow-On Offering"), pursuant to which it was offering to sell a maximum of 30,000,000 shares of its common stock (exclusive of 2,500,000 shares available pursuant to its DRIP) and 255,000 shares reserved for issuance under its Employee and Director Incentive Restricted Share Plan), at a price of $10.00 per share (subject to certain volume discounts). The Follow-On Offering was declared effective by SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 on September 27, 2012. The Follow-On Offering terminated on September 27, 2014.  Our DRIP Registration Statement on Form S-3D was filed and became effective under the Securities Act of 1933 on September 26, 2014. On January 19, 2015, the Board of Directors suspended the Company's DRIP effective April 15, 2015. For so long as the DRIP remains suspended, all future distributions will be in the form of cash.  We do not have employees. We entered into an advisory agreement, dated February 17, 2009, with Lightstone Value Plus REIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which we refer to as the "Advisor," pursuant to which the Advisor supervises and manages our day-to-day operations and selects our real estate and real estate related investments, subject to oversight by our board of directors. We pay the Advisor fees for services related to the investment and management of our assets, and we will reimburse the Advisor for certain expenses incurred on our behalf.  To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we engage in certain activities through a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). As such, we are subject to U.S. federal and state income and franchise taxes from these activities.  Current Environment  Our operating results as well as our investment opportunities are impacted by the health of the North American economies. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as availability of credit, financial markets volatility, and recession.  Our business may be affected by market and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. and global economies.

The annualized base rent disclosed in the table above includes all concessions, abatements and reimbursements of rent to tenants.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  There were no material changes during the three months ended June 30, 2015 to our critical accounting policies as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Results of Operations  The Company's primary financial measure for evaluating its properties is net operating income ("NOI"). NOI represents revenues less property operating expenses, real estate taxes and general and administrative expenses. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Company's properties.  For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 vs. June 30, 2014  For the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company's consolidated results of operations included the operating results from (i) the TownePlace Suites - Metairie, (ii) the SpringHill Suites - Peabody, (iii) the Fairfield Inn - East Rutherford, (iv) the TownePlace Suites - Fayetteville and the TownePlace Suites  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Company's consolidated results of operations included the operating results from (i) the TownePlace Suites - Metairie, (ii) the SpringHill Suites - Peabody, (iii) the Fairfield Inn - East Rutherford, (iv) the TownePlace Suites - Fayetteville and the TownePlace Suites  2015 Consolidated  Rental revenue  Rental revenue increased by $11.9 million to $18.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6.4 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels described above as well as higher revenue at several of our hotels which underwent brand-required property improvement plans during 2014.  Property operating expenses  Property operating expenses increased by $7.5 million to $11.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels noted above.  Real estate taxes  Real estate taxes increased by $0.5 million to $0.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels described above.  General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million to $1.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2014.

Depreciation and amortization  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.2 million to $2.1 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.9 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels described above.  Interest and dividend income  Interest and dividend income increased by $0.2 million to $0.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the interest income from our notes receivable from affiliate.  Earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities  Our loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities during the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $41 compared to $22 for the same period in 2014. Our earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities are attributable to our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated affiliated entities, which we account for under the equity method of accounting.  Interest expense  Interest expense was $1.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.3 million for the same period in 2014. Interest expense during both periods primarily consisted of interest related to our mortgage indebtedness and increased during 2015 due to the financing of the acquisition of the hotels described above.  Noncontrolling interests  The income or loss allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) the interest in our Operating Partnership held by our Sponsor and (ii) membership interests held by others in the Joint Venture and the interests held by minority owners of certain of our hotels.  For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 vs. June 30, 2014  For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company's consolidated results of operations included the operating results from (i) the TownePlace Suites - Metairie, (ii) the SpringHill Suites - Peabody, (iii) the Fairfield Inn - East Rutherford, (iv) the TownePlace Suites - Fayetteville and the TownePlace Suites  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company's consolidated results of operations included the operating results from (i) the TownePlace Suites - Metairie, (ii) the SpringHill Suites - Peabody, (iii) the Fairfield Inn - East Rutherford, (iv) the TownePlace Suites - Fayetteville and the TownePlace Suites  2015 Consolidated  Rental revenue  Rental revenue increased by $23.4 million to $33.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $9.7 million for the same period in 2014.

Property operating expenses  Property operating expenses increased by $14.4 million to $20.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6.1 million for the same period in 2014.

General and administrative expenses  General and administrative expenses increased by $1.7 million to $2.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels described above partially offset by our Sponsor's waiver of asset management fees in the first half of 2014 (see Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information).  Depreciation and amortization  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.4 million to $3.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the hotels described above.  Interest and dividend income  Interest and dividend income increased by $0.2 million to $1.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the interest income from our notes receivable from affiliate.  Other income, net  Other income, net increased by $0.2 million to $0.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to an expense of $35 for the same period in 2014. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of an unconsolidated investment carried at cost.  Earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities  Our loss from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities during the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $85 compared to $58 for the same period in 2014. Our earnings from investments in unconsolidated affiliated entities are attributable to our ownership interests in certain unconsolidated affiliated entities, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  Interest expense  Interest expense was $2.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2014. Interest expense during both periods primarily consisted of interest related to our mortgage indebtedness and increased during 2015 due to the financing of the acquisition of the hotels described above.  Noncontrolling interests  The income or loss allocated to noncontrolling interests relates to (i) the interest in our Operating Partnership held by our Sponsor and (ii) membership interests held by others in the Joint Venture and the interests held by minority owners of certain of our hotels.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  Overview:  For the six months ended June 30, 2015, our primary sources of funds were (i) $59.3 million of proceeds from mortgage financings and (ii) $1.7 million of cash contributions from noncontrolling interests. The primary source of capital required to fund our future purchases of real estate and/or real estate related investments will principally come from the remaining uninvested proceeds related to our public offering of shares of our common stock and from any indebtedness that we may incur either in connection with the acquisition of any real estate and real estate related investments or thereafter.  We have and intend to continue to utilize leverage either in connection with acquiring our properties or subsequent to their acquisition. The number of different properties we will acquire will be affected by numerous factors, including, the amount of funds available to us. When interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to us or within a timeframe that is acceptable to us, we may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time.  Our future sources of funds will primarily consist of (i) cash flows from our operations, (ii) proceeds from our borrowings, (iii) the repayment of revolving promissory notes (the "Notes Receivable from Affiliate") from Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. ("Lightstone III") and (iv) the release of funds held in restricted escrows. We currently believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from other than these sources within the next twelve months.  We currently have mortgage indebtedness totaling $115.5 million and a margin loan of $6.3 million. We have and intend to continue to limit our aggregate . . .

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
