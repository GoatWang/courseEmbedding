Linda Walker asked a question
I have dealt with Copart Auto Auction for years, always buying Clean Titles, Insurance cars either hail, or theft recovery..
Last week I bought a 2015 Chevrolet Sonic ( Farmeres Insurance) Clean Title (Theft Recovery)  It had a Oklahoma Clean Title referencing (Theft Recovery) in small letters in the corner of the title..When I titled it in Missouri, my title came back with Prior Salvage stamped on my title..Copart says I will have to fight with MO Dept of Rev..They say Farmers did not salvage out the car...Is this false advertising, or is MO Dept of Rev at fault?  
Please help?

 Educational Background



 


University of Oklahoma

                  Attracting top students from across the nation and more than 100 countries around the world, OU provides a major university experience in a private college atmosphere. OU is number one in the nation in the number of National Merit Scholars enrolled among public universities and is in the top ten of public universities in the nation in the graduation of Rhodes Scholars. The OU Honors College is one of the largest honors programs among public universities in the United States, matching the University’s best and brightest students with faculty in classrooms of 19 or fewer students. OU is one of the few public universities in the nation to cap the class size of first-year English composition courses at no more than 19. OU offers students the opportunity to study abroad in over 100 cities and 50 countries, including our signature program in Arezzo, Italy. The number of endowed faculty professorships and chaired positions has increased from less than 100 15 years ago to more than 560 today. This enables OU to keep and attract faculty researchers of national and international stature. 

 
For four of the last six years the OU Debate team has won the National Debate Championship. Other students from across campus have worked in teams to also win top awards in the National Petroleum Engineering Competition, the National Kennedy Center Competition in Drama, and the entrepreneurship program consistently ranks in the top five nationally.

 
OU has emerged as a pacesetter for public higher education in the United States and is ranked by The Princeton Review among the top 10 public universities in the nation in terms of academic excellence and cost for students. OU has more than doubled the amount of private scholarships in five years and raised its scholarship goal to $250 million. In addition, OU’s private endowment has increased more than five-fold since 1994, growing from $204 million to more than $1.8 billion. 

 
There is a true sense of family on the OU campus. Serving as a model for other public universities, OU established the Faculty-In-Residence program which places faculty members and their families in each of our residence halls to foster faculty and student interaction and encourage intergenerational friendships. Further, a different professor adopts each floor of the residence halls as well as each fraternity and sorority, allowing students and faculty to build relationships outside of the classroom. 

 
OU’s Fred Jones Museum of Art ranks in the top 5 university art museums in the United States. It received the Weitzenhoffer Collection, the largest gift of French Impressionist art ever given to a public university in the US. The Sam Noble Museum of Natural History is the largest university based museum of its kind in the world. OU’s Bizzell Memorial Library features one of the three largest history of science collections in the world, and is the only place in the United States where you can hold a book with Galileo's handwriting in your own hands.
