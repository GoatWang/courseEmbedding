CONE Midstream To Acquire Remaining 25% Additional Interest In Anchor Systems






GlobeNewswire



Nov 16, 2016 6:00 AM EST













 




























































 CANONSBURG, Pa., Nov. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:CNNX) (the "Partnership") today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an additional 25% ownership interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP, commonly referred to as the "Anchor Systems".  The transaction, which is expected to close before the end of the fourth quarter, is for a total purchase consideration of $248 million, comprised of $140 million in cash and issuance of approximately 5.2 million common limited partnership units to our Sponsors.  The cash portion of the purchase consideration will be funded through borrowings under the Partnership's $250 million revolving credit facility (1), which had $41 million drawn as of September 30, 2016.  The Partnership currently owns a 75% interest in the Anchor Systems, and acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest will increase the Partnership's ownership share of the Anchor Systems to 100% (2).  The interest is being acquired from CONE Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by subsidiaries of our Sponsors, CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CNX) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NBL). John T. Lewis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive officer of CONE Midstream GP LLC, said, "We are pleased to announce our first dropdown transaction.  This acquisition demonstrates our commitment to grow CNNX over the long term, the supportive nature of our relationship with our Sponsors, and our Sponsors' confidence in the continued future growth of CONE. "We project acquisition of the remaining 25% ownership interest in the Anchor Systems will be immediately accretive to our unitholders," continued Mr. Lewis.  "The financial impact of the acquisition is not included in our current EBITDA or DCF guidance and, depending on the timing of transaction closing, will be additive to those projected results.  The anticipated increase in distributable cash flow is expected to increase our future cash distribution coverage and enhance our ability to continue to grow our quarterly cash distributions over time.  Using a combination of debt and equity financing for this transaction keeps our balance sheet strong and leaves additional debt capacity for financing growth through new organic projects and third party opportunities.  We continue to view our very robust distribution coverage and low leverage as important positive attributes that set CONE Midstream apart from others in the industry."

CONE GATHERING LLC SELLS
ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN PIPELINE AND COMPRESSION SYSTEMS TO CONE
MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP

HOUSTON AND PITTSBURGH
(November 16, 2016) – Noble
Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL ) and CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:
CNX ) (the “Sponsors”) announced today that CONE
Gathering LLC, which is jointly owned by the Sponsors, has entered
into a definitive agreement to contribute its remaining 25%
ownership interest in CONE Midstream DevCo I LP (the “Anchor
Systems”) to CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: CNNX )
for a total valuation of $248 million. Upon closing, each
Sponsor will receive $70 million in cash and approximately 2.6
million limited partnership units of CNNX.

The Anchor Systems include over 125
miles of pipelines and 650 million cubic feet per day of natural
gas compression capacity, which gather and transport production
from the Sponsors’ Marcellus natural gas assets. The
Anchor Systems represent a substantial majority of CNNX’s
revenues and cash flows.

The transaction represents the
initial dropdown of assets from the Sponsors following CNNX’s
IPO in late 2014. As part of the transaction, the Conflicts
Committee of the Board of Directors of CNNX consulted with an
independent valuation expert who issued a fairness opinion to
CNNX.

Following closing of the
transaction, which is anticipated by the end of 2016, CNNX will own
100% of the Anchor Systems. CONE Gathering LLC continues to
own 95% interests in each of the CONE Midstream DevCo II LP (the
“Growth Systems”) and CONE Midstream DevCo III LP (the
“Additional Systems”), with CNNX owning the remaining
5% in each. NBL and CNX will each hold approximately 34.2% of
the common and subordinated limited partnership units of CNNX,
combined.


About CONSOL Energy

CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) is a
Pittsburgh-based producer of natural gas and coal. The company is
one of the largest independent natural gas exploration, development
and production companies, with operations centered in the major
