Publisher's Description▼▲
This book is written in line with apostolic orthodoxy of Scripture. It gives clear theological thought why only Jesus Christ qualifies as our Passover Lamb, showing how the sacrificial death of Christ negates the effect of the Fall of Adam and Eve. The book reviews the sacrifices of Old Testament patriarchs, priests, prophets and kings. It narrates in detail the origin and events of the Jewish Passover, which also foreshadows the New Testament Passover instituted by Christ. In this book you will understand clearly why other sacrifices by mankind are not enough for sin atonement. The book brings to light why believers should share in the elements of the covenant at the Holy Communion Table with reverence and hearts of gratitude to God for the finished work of Christ on the cross. Christ Our Passover Lamb is a must for anyone who wants to know more why grace and truth came by Jesus Christ, giving you an insight into the mystery of His sacrifice hidden in the mind of God before the world began. This book will certainly bless and inspire you to share in the marriage supper of the Lamb with other saints in His coming Kingdom.
