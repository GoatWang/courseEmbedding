Its Energy Dynamics Fund was down 1.9 percent over the same time period, while its flagship $12 billion fund, the Developed Markets Fund was down 7.9 percent. Lansdowne's European Equity Fund was down 11.9 percent and its Developed Markets Strategic Investment Fund was down 8.2 percent.  Landsdowne's long-only funds were also down, with the European Long Only Fund losing 4.6 percent and the Developed Markets Long Only Funds down 5.6 percent. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment. Last year, all Landsdowne's funds were in positive territory, with the flagship Developed Markets Fund up 16.9 percent, the European Equity Fund up 28.2 percent, the Energy Dynamics Fund returning 14.8 percent and the Global Financials Fund 1.8 percent, according to performance statistics seen by Reuters.
