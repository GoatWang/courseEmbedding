 Patxi’s Pizza gets boost from private equity investment 



                                                posted in: Investment 

 

San Francisco, California
Patxi’s Pizza gets boost from private equity investment. Exec says deal will help chain compete with fast-casual brands.

The Patxi’s Pizza chain is ramping up growth and testing new ovens that will help the full-service, deep-dish concept compete with the growing crop of fast-casual pizza players.
The San Francisco-based Patxi’s — pronounced, “pah-cheese” — closed on a deal in February that gave private-equity firm KarpReilly LLC a controlling interest.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Bill Freeman, Patxi’s chief executive, said the growth capital will help support the 12-unit chain’s planned expansion.
The chain plans to open four more units in 2014 and another five to eight units in 2015. The goal is to reach 70-plus units within five years, Freeman said. All units will be company owned, and the chain has no plans to franchise.
Freeman, a former telecommunications entrepreneur, founded Patxi’s in 2004 with friend and pizza chef Francisco “Patxi” Azpiroz. Their aim was to create a warm and inviting neighborhood pizza joint offering Chicago-style deep-dish pies with quality ingredients.
More recently, Patxi’s has been perfecting a thin-crust addition to the menu. The chain is testing and likely to roll out new electric 800-degree ovens, made specifically for thin-crust pies, that allow the chef to dial in the ideal cooking temperature for the top and bottom of the pizza.
Thin-crust pizzas will bake in about 2.5 minutes in the new ovens versus roughly 10 minutes in the chain’s existing ovens designed for the original signature deep dish. That means guests will be able to order a custom pizza that can be served at a speed that would be more conducive to lunch. It also means that Patxi’s will be able to compete more directly with rapidly growing fast-casual pizza players like MOD Pizza, Blaze Fast Fire’d Pizza and PizzaRev.
“We can bake a pizza just as quickly as they can,” noted Freeman.
Unlike the fast-casual pizza chains, however, Patxi’s does about half of its business in dine-out and delivery orders. Patxi’s also has a full bar with about 20 beers on tap.
The average check is about $35, and average unit volumes top $2.5 million in restaurants that are typically between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet, said Freeman. The chain has recorded same-store sales increases of 15 percent or more over the past five years.
“Overall, the quality of our food is what differentiates us,” he said. “But people also see us as a great value. You feel like you had a $70 experience for $30.”
Freeman said the partnership with KarpReilly is a good fit for Patxi’s. KarpReilly has a long history of investment in the restaurant space, including chains such as Café Rio, Burger Lounge, Café Zupas, Habit Burger Grill, Miller’s Ale House, Marie Callender’s, Z Tejas Southwestern Grill, Mimi’s Café, Elephant Bar, the Sprinkles cupcake concept, and Hooters.
As a result of the deal, Russ Bendel, Habit Burger’s chief executive and an industry veteran, has joined Patxi’s board of directors, Freeman said.

LifeAID Announces Investment from KarpReilly

Press Release Jul. 20, 2016 at 9:28 am









        More 











Santa Cruz, Calif., July 19, 2016 – LifeAID Beverage Company has secured an investment from private-equity firm KarpReilly, LLC (Dollar Tree, Sprinkles, The Habit Burger, Kevita, Zola…) to fund its continuing path of growth.

With their capital investment and imitable expertise, we now have greater resources to continue on our roadmap. We are building our brand to serve consumers with functional products that fit their lifestyle. There is a momentous shift happening in the beverage market. Consumers are waking up to what they are putting in their body, demanding alternatives to traditional sports drinks, energy drinks and sodas. LifeAID is the answer.”
“We were impressed with what Orion, Aaron and the entire team has done in such a short time with the resources they had available.” says KarpReilly co-founder Allan Karp, who will be joining the LifeAID board. “LifeAID is full of tremendous promise and is a great addition to our beverage portfolio. The writing is on the wall… functional beverages represent an evolution, we are betting on the best suited team to lead that change.”

News>Emerging Chains Eureka! receives investment from KarpReilly


    Small-box casual-dining chain plots further expansion  

Lisa Jennings | May 11, 2015









Eureka! Restaurant Group LLC has received an investment from private-equity firm KarpReilly LLC to help fund growth, the company said Monday.
Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, and co-CEO Justin Nedelman declined to characterize KarpReilly’s stake in the Hawthorne, Calif.-based casual-dining chain.
Nedelman said the funding will help support the 14-unit concept’s growth plan of adding four to six units per year and the continued building of infrastructure.

KarpReilly invests in LifeAID


July 21, 2016
By Iris Dorbian






LifeAID Beverage Company, a maker of healthy and nutritional products, has raised an undisclosed amount of funding. The investor was KarpReilly LLC.
PRESS RELEASE
SANTA CRUZ, Calif., July 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — LifeAID Beverage Company has secured an investment from private-equity firm KarpReilly, LLC (Dollar Tree, Sprinkles, The Habit Burger, Kevita, Zola…) to fund its continuing path of growth. The total amount of the transaction remains undisclosed, although represents a significant minority position according to company reps.
LifeAID’s line of “better-for-you” products includes FitAID, FocusAID, PartyAID, TravelAID, GolferAID, and the FitAID Fuel Pouch.
LifeAID co-founders Orion Melehan and Dr. Aaron Hinde considered other PE firms before selecting KarpReilly as the ideal partner.
“The team at KarpReilly understands current consumer trends and passionately supports the functionality and nutritional value of our products. Additionally they were impressed with our go-to-market successes in non-traditional channels such as golf courses and CrossFit® gyms,” stated company president Dr. Hinde.
CEO Melehan added, “KarpReilly has a long-view approach and an impressive track record of scaling consumer brands. With their capital investment and imitable expertise, we now have greater resources to continue on our roadmap. We are building our brand to serve consumers with functional products that fit their lifestyle. There is a momentous shift happening in the beverage market. Consumers are waking up to what they are putting in their body, demanding alternatives to traditional sports drinks, energy drinks and sodas. LifeAID is the answer.” 





“We were impressed with what Orion, Aaron and the entire team has done in such a short time with the resources they had available,” says KarpReilly co-founder Allan Karp, who will be joining the LifeAID board. “LifeAID is full of tremendous promise and is a great addition to our beverage portfolio. The writing is on the wall… functional beverages represent an evolution, we are betting on the best suited team to lead that change.”
The proceeds from this raise will expand the LifeAID sales/marketing teams, supporting LifeAID’s growing footprint in conventional retailers through a DSD network. The brand is currently sold in The Vitamin Shoppe, H.E.B, and Whole Foods, with authorizations at multiple Safeway/Albertsons divisions. The natural channel will continue to be serviced by UNFI.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
