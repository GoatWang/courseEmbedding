NEW YORK, Dec. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Broadfin Capital, LLC (together with its affiliates, "Broadfin" or "we") is the beneficial owner of approximately 17.3%, on an as-converted basis, of the outstanding common and preferred stock of Cardica, Inc. (Nasdaq:   CRDC) ("Cardica" or the "Company").
Over the past couple of months, Broadfin led a campaign to improve the Board of Directors of Cardica (the "Board") by electing its three extremely-qualified, independent directors, Gregory D. Casciaro, R. Michael Kleine and Samuel E. Navarro to the Board. 
We are happy that based on preliminary results overwhelmingly the shareholders of the Company voted on Broadfin's gold proxy card, following the recommendations of both leading proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass Lewis & Co., LLC ("Glass Lewis").  By voting on our proxy card, the shareholders of Cardica elected Messrs. Casciaro, Kleine and Navarro with an overwhelming mandate.  
Kevin Kotler, Managing Partner of Broadfin stated: "There should be no doubt that this important vote clearly mandated the Board to make the changes necessary at Cardica to ensure the maximum chance for shareholder value creation. We are pleased we were able to serve as a catalyst for meaningful improvement of the composition of the Board.  In addition to the election of our three director candidates, the Board added another two new directors during the course of our campaign, resulting in a significantly refreshed and strengthened Board."
"Now that Cardica's shareholders have spoken resoundingly in supporting and demanding this Board change, we believe that the message to the entire Cardica Board is clear -- to immediately enact real and positive changes for the benefit of all stockholders. We are excited to have a revitalized Board positioned to maximize the competitive advantages of our Company's valuable technology at this critical stage in the Cardica's lifecycle," concluded Mr. Kotler.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
