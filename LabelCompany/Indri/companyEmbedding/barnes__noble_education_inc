Barnes & Noble Education earnings miss expectations, but sales beat
Barnes & Noble Education Inc. , a contract operator of bookstores for educational institutions, reported fourth quarter net income of $227,000, breaking even on earnings per share, after a loss of $2.8 million, or 6 cents per share, for the same period last year. The FactSet consensus was for 14 cents per share. Sales totaled $342.8 million, up from $294.8 million last year and ahead of the $311.0 million FactSet consensus. Same-store sales increased 1.4%. The FactSet consensus was for a 2.8% decline. The company completed the acquisition of MBS Textbook Exchange in February and says it will now report in two segments, one for Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, or BNC, and one for MBS. There are 712 MBS stores. The company sees flat fiscal-year 2018 BNC sales and expects same-store sales to decline in the low- to mid-single digit percentage point range. Consolidated sales are expected to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion before "intercompany eliminations." Barnes & Noble Education shares are unchanged in Wednesday premarket trading, and down 12.5% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8.3% for 2017 to date.

Barnes & Noble Education earnings miss expectations, but sales beat
Barnes & Noble Education Inc. , a contract operator of bookstores for educational institutions, reported fourth quarter net income of $227,000, breaking even on earnings per share, after a loss of $2.8 million, or 6 cents per share, for the same period last year. The FactSet consensus was for 14 cents per share. Sales totaled $342.8 million, up from $294.8 million last year and ahead of the $311.0 million FactSet consensus. Same-store sales increased 1.4%. The FactSet consensus was for a 2.8% decline. The company completed the acquisition of MBS Textbook Exchange in February and says it will now report in two segments, one for Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, or BNC, and one for MBS. There are 712 MBS stores. The company sees flat fiscal-year 2018 BNC sales and expects same-store sales to decline in the low- to mid-single digit percentage point range. Consolidated sales are expected to be in the range of $2.25 billion to $2.35 billion before "intercompany eliminations." Barnes & Noble Education shares are unchanged in Wednesday premarket trading, and down 12.5% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8.3% for 2017 to date.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Vendor and Product Compliance Requirements | B&N INC








































Vendor and Product Compliance Requirements





Product quality and safety has always been a priority for Barnes & Noble, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Barnes & Noble” or “B&N”) and, as new and complex safety standards emerge, we count on our suppliers and manufacturers to provide products that meet or exceed all applicable safety requirements.
Many of the products produced and sold by Barnes & Noble are regulated by federal, state and local laws and other industry guidelines and standards. Regulations and standards change over time and as such, Vendors must stay apprised of products they supply. Barnes & Noble requires all suppliers to stand fully behind their products. We depend on you to maintain knowledge of and comply with all safety standards for your products.
To that extent, we have developed a Vendor and Product Compliance program to ensure that we continue to provide high quality, safe products to our customers. All costs associated with the removal of Vendor’s products from Barnes & Noble stores or distribution centers in violation of these requirements or any other product compliance remediation, will be at the cost of Vendor. Barnes & Noble reserves the right to assess doing business with any supplier who does not comply with these requirements.

 Vendor Compliance Certification (VCC)


In connection with the Barnes & Noble Compliance Program, all new Vendors who supply or manufacturer product for Barnes & Noble will be required to complete and sign our Vendor Compliance Certification form as part of the new Vendor on-boarding package. Existing Vendors are also required to have submitted a Vendor Compliance Certification form.

Children’s Products


The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), along with other directives and amendments, enacted new requirements related to lead paint, lead content, phthalates and tracking labels for products designed or intended primarily for children 12 years old or younger. (For more details on the Consumer Product Safety Commission, visit www.cpsc.gov/en.)
For all Children’s Products (which are defined by the CPSIA as products intended primarily for children 12 years old or younger), Vendor shall ensure that:

All children’s products will comply with all applicable safety testing requirements including, but not limited to, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) requirements for toy safety and CPSIA requirements for lead content, lead paint and phthalate requirements.
All children’s products will contain all requisite labeling and safety warnings, including, but not limited to, requisite CPSIA tracking information, which will be permanently affixed to the product.
 




Toxic Chemical Laws and Regulations


All products produced for and/or supplied to Barnes & Noble must comply with federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations regarding toxicity in products.  These laws are often known as “Green Chemistry Laws,” and typically pertain to children’s products. Click here for a listing of websites about these laws which you may find helpful.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive list, and all Barnes & Noble suppliers and manufacturers are expected to remain abreast of existing and newly adopted safety standards and legal obligations applicable to their products. 
Some of these laws require manufacturers and certain retailers, to disclose the presence of certain listed chemicals above pre-defined limits in their products.  Some jurisdictions outright prohibit the inclusion of listed chemicals in children’s products sold there.  For jurisdictions where a sales ban is required for the presence of certain chemicals, Vendors are required to meet those conditions and limit or eliminate the presence of those chemicals in their products as required by law.  For jurisdictions where sales of the product obligates the manufacturer or retailer to disclose or report certain information regarding such products (e.g., State of Washington), Vendors are responsible for completing the reporting required by Barnes & Noble and paying any and all associated fees.  Vendors of in-scope products may be required to make a reasonable, good-faith effort to provide declarations about the content of product supplied in the form requested by Barnes & Noble. 
In addition, there are laws prohibiting or limiting the use of chlorinated flame retardants that contain TCEP and TDCPP (TRIS) in certain states (e.g., Vermont, New York and Maryland) which affect various product scopes including toys and childcare articles.
Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, California Health & Safety Code §§ 25249.5 et seq. (Prop 65), listed chemicals are known to the state of California to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm.  These regulations are not limited to children’s products, and apply to all products sold in the State of California.  
Barnes & Noble expects all Vendors to be familiar with these laws, to proactively test their products (contact Compliance@bn.com for approved testing labs) and advise Barnes & Noble immediately if any product supplied contains any toxic chemicals. 




Electronics Products


For all Electronics Products, Vendor shall ensure that:

If required, Vendor has registered its products as covered electronic devices (each a CED) in all states that have enacted e-Cycling laws and will renew and maintain such registrations so long as Vendor supplies such CEDs to B&N for resale.
Vendor will provide to B&N adequate quantities of any materials or information required by law for retailers to distribute or share with consumers in connection with a sale of Vendor’s CEDs in any and all appropriate forms of media, including, but not limited to, Internet website links, notices or inserts affixed to or included with the product, and printed posters, flyers or brochures, as required.
If Vendor’s product is defined as a CED by the Public Resources Code of California Section 42463, Vendor will notify B&N in writing, so long as B&N will be carrying its product by April 1 of each year, and Vendor shall also submit a copy of such notification letter to the California State Board of Equalization. Such notification shall include the brand and type of CED and applicable fee category.
Immediate notification will be provided to B&N if Vendor’s CED registration status changes in any state.
 




Conflict Minerals


Barnes & Noble supports responsible sourcing practices, which includes compliance with the Conflict Minerals provision (Section 1502) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank). Vendors who manufacture B&N proprietary product are required to design and implement reasonable processes to ensure transparency related to the content and materials comprising all products supplied to Barnes & Noble, which may include gold, tantalum, tin, and tungsten and the ores from which they are derived. These Vendors are required to assist Barnes & Noble with its conflict minerals compliance by making a reasonable, good-faith effort to answer any questions and to provide all declarations in the form requested by Barnes & Noble. Upon request, these Vendors are required to communicate, to the best of their knowledge, the country of origin and content of the product(s) supplied to Barnes & Noble and to determine whether these products contain “conflict minerals” as defined by Dodd-Frank.
Barnes & Noble has established an emailbox to facilitate communication with interested parties. Any questions or concerns relating to Barnes & Noble’s Conflict Minerals efforts should be directed to this emailbox: conflictminerals@bn.com. In addition, please refer to FAQs on Conflict Minerals located within the Product Compliance Frequently Asked Questions.

Why Autoliv, Maxim Integrated Products, and Barnes & Noble Education Slumped Today
These stocks weighed on the market. Find out why.











                Dan Caplinger
            

                (TMFGalagan)



            
            Jul 21, 2017 at 4:53PM
            
            





Wall Street suffered a mild drop on Friday, although losses were relatively small. Major benchmarks were generally down less than 0.2% as investors coasted into the weekend on a quiet note. Larger moves downward in the currency and energy markets caused some nervousness among market participants, but a relatively balanced slate of earnings reports from U.S. companies kept stocks from moving too far in one direction. Shares of some companies, however, suffered fairly large declines on Friday, and Autoliv (NYSE:ALV), Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM), and Barnes & Noble Education (NYSE:BNED) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly.
Autoliv gets unbuckled
Shares of Autoliv dropped 8% after the Swedish maker of automotive safety systems reported tepid results for the second quarter of 2017. The company said that organic sales were up just 0.2%, falling below the company's guidance for 2% growth, and guidance for the third quarter also reflected sluggish vehicle production volumes in North America and China. CEO Jan Carlson was still pleased about the company's execution in the passive safety market, and Autoliv is excited about new strategic agreements with technology providers to move forward with self-driving technologies and active-safety electronics. Yet coming after a very strong performance in the first quarter, investors had hoped that Autoliv would do a better job of sustaining momentum.

Maxim disappoints on a poor outlook
Maxim Integrated Products stock was down 6% in the wake of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter financial report. The semiconductor chipmaker said that adjusted earnings rose more than expected, and it announced a 9% dividend increase, pushing Maxim's yield above the 3% mark. Yet revenue didn't measure up to the consensus forecast among those following the stock, and Maxim's guidance for the current quarter suffered from a projected downturn in demand from its smartphone business. Maxim's strong reputation as a dividend stock is rare for a technology company, but the chipmaker will need to get its fundamental business to grow faster in order to reassure investors of its long-term upward trajectory.





Barnes & Noble Education gets a new CEO
Finally, Barnes & Noble Education lost 5%, giving up modest gains from yesterday's session. The college bookstore specialist said early Thursday that Michael Huseby will replace outgoing CEO Max Roberts, who intends to retire in September. Huseby intends to keep moving forward with B&N Education's growth strategy by "executing on our mission to improve academic outcomes with our comprehensive offering of relevant and affordable products, high-touch services, and innovative learning platforms." Yet with Huseby having served previously as CEO of B&N Education's former parent company, some shareholders apparently thought twice about the new chief executive's ability to come up with the groundbreaking solutions that might be necessary to sustain the college bookstore company's competitive position in a tough industry.
