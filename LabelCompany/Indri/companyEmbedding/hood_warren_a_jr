 WARREN A. HOOD, SR. & WARREN A. HOOD, JR.
      

Polly Dement


From: Mississippi Entrepreneurs


In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:
Warren A. Hood, Sr.’s contribution to economic development and civic life in Mississippi can’t be fully appreciated without a return to Copiah County, circa 1940. After boyhood days in the Depression that began at 3:00 a.m. milking cows, attending the agricultural high school and freshman classes at Hinds Community College and working for $1.50 warren a. hood, sr. warren a. hood, jr. 19 a day in his cousin’s sawmill operation, the 23-year-old Hood bought his cousin’s peckerwood sawmill for $900. “You just roll a peckerwood sawmill out into the woods and cut timber,” explained James W. “Jimmy” Hood, the younger of the late Warren Hood, Sr.’s sons. “He didn’t raise capital. When he went to a bank in Hazlehurst to borrow the $300 down payment on the mill, the bank president said, ‘We’re not loaning money today.’ A friend lent him the $300, and another sold him his first tract of land on credit.” During World War II Hood operated his sawmill at full tilt, supplying lumber for military installations and products like ammunition boxes. By the war’s end he had started a lumber company in nearby Claiborne County, married Elsie Meadows and welcomed the first of their four children. Riding high on post-war pent-up demand for new homes, Hood moved his headquarters to Jackson in 1948 and by the end of the 1960’s “my father had eight sawmills in his portfolio, all in Mississippi except for one about 50 feet over the Alabama line,” recalled Warren A. Hood, Jr. While Warren, Sr., was building Hood Manufacturing Company, the holding company for his sawmill operations, into “the largest producer of Southern yellow pine east of the Mississippi River,” he also became part of “an amazing group of entrepreneurs,” said Warren, Jr. “Their generation worked not only to do well for themselves but for the benefit of the state.” Citing creation of Mississippi Industries , Inc., in 1960 as the epitome of Hood’s beneficent entrepreneurship stage, Jimmy said, “Dad formed a publicly-traded venture company with former Governor Hugh White to buy failing businesses throughout the state. Their strategy was to approach leading citizens in the community and say, ‘Y’all put up half the capital; we’ll put up half and bring this business back to life.’ He created advisory boards in towns, and nearly every lawyer and banker in the state was a shareholder. That’s how he got so well-connected politically.” The portfolio grew to include plants to manufacture Old Diz Charcoal, pressurized tanks, roofing, bricks, paper bags and truck bodies. In 1969 Hood combined Mississippi Industries and Hood Manufacturing into one company, Hood Industries, Inc. Revenues that year were over $26 million with net profits topping $1.5 million. In 1970 Hood Industries merged with Masonite ] [Two Generations Of Hood Industrial Complexes 20 Warren A. Hood, Sr., Warren A. Hood, Jr. Corporation. The Wall Street Journal reported, “Masonite said it will issue approximately 560,000 shares of its common stock for the Hood business . . . worth about $19.2 million.” The name Hood Industries disappeared with the Masonite acquisition, but was picked up in 1984 by Warren, Jr., for the wood products manufacturing and distribution subsidiary of Hood Companies, Inc., the Hattiesburg-headquartered holding company he founded in 1978. “Of my 60 or so plants only two have some connection to my father,” reflected Warren, Jr. “On his recommendation my first acquisition (1978) was Southern Bag Corporation in Yazoo City, which became the basis of Hood Packaging Corporation, one of my four operating companies. In 1982 I bought a roofing plant from Masonite, also once my father’s, that’s the foundation of Atlas Roofing Corporation.” The fourth and newest operational division is Hood Container Corporation. Self-described as “a quiet, behind-thescenes introvert,” Warren, Jr., is characteristically low-profile about his business, which he describes as “much like a private equity firm, but it’s my money, not a bunch of other people’s.” It’s his brother Jimmy who’s quick to say, “Warren has built an exceptional business , outside of what my dad did.” Agreeing that “my company’s more than 100-fold of my father’s in terms of size and sales,” Warren , Jr., asserts, “But he came a lot further. His path was more difficult, coming from literally having nothing. People in the state admired where he came from and what he accomplished.” Warren Hood, Sr...
