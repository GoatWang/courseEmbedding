So cute and so much fun. This toy is also educational in my opinion as it teaches children a little bit about caring for a child. Baby Alive can speak in two languages English and Spanish, plus her mouth moves when she talks.....really cute! She can say 30+ phrases. The doll has a non-removable bracelet in which you squeeze her wrist to make her talk....so easy and convenient. She comes with reusable doll food and children can even make the food by using the included molds and roller. Baby Alive comes with two diapers...and yes, when fed, Baby Alive will make use of the diaper. Ha! Additionally, she even comes with her own plate and container of juice with straw(no liquid, only for pretend) and when the straw is inserted in her mouth, it looks as if she is really drinking. Her eyes are do not move. She has a pretty pink dress on with pink bloomers underneath. Baby Alive does require 3 double AA alkaline batteries (Demo Batteries are included). This doll is for ages 3+ years of age. (This toy is by 'Hasbro' and additional accessories may be purchased separately subject to availability)

I have the Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll (Blonde). She comes with 3 AA demo batteries, 2 diapers, 2 small packages of a soft putty-like dough in green and orange, a plastic tool to use as a rolling pin, and 3 cookie cutter type utensils to cut out her play food in shapes like carrots and apple slices, a pretend juice box with pretend straw, and the cute outfit she is wearing. There is a 'built in' pink bracelet on her left wrist. If you squeeze the bracelet, she says cute things like asking her new mommy if it's snack time.
Sara his the harder body style doll. She has joints at the shoulder and hips to move arms and legs slightly. Her mouth moves when she speaks, and also moves when she 'chews' her food or sips her juice. When fed her reusable putty food, it goes in her mouth and drops thru a passage from her throat to her diaper to be 're-used' . Her eyes do not close when you lay her down for a 'nap', as little girls do, but, they are pretty eyes. You can hear the mechanical sounds when she talks, but, the cuteness factor over rides it. The suggested age is 3 years and up. I noticed on Walmart.com that other food shape tools and putty colors are available for purchase at this time. All in all, nice interactive doll for the little girl in your life.

My daughter's birthday is coming up and I decided to let my daughter open this today as soon as it arrived. My first thoughts were how cute the doll is and how much fun she will have with the doll. This doll is made to "eat" the doll food and then "eliminate it" into the diapers provided. Her mouth moves while talking. This doll comes with ten accessories, a plate, pretend juice box, rolling pin, two diapers, two one ounce containers of reusable doll food, three shaping tools, and instructions on how to clean the pretend food out of the doll. She knows thirty or more phrases and can speak English or Spanish. You can press the bracelet on the dolls wrist to make her talk. She can tell you when she is hungry, when she wants you to make snacks, her diaper is full, and when she is sleepy. One thing I think should be fixed is the amount of pressure you have to use to squeeze the wrist bracelet in order for it to talk. A small child might have trouble getting the doll to talk if they can't squeeze the bracelet with enough force. The box says it is for children ages 18 months and up. I think this will make a wonderful Christmas present or birthday gift for any little girl. They can have so much fun with this. It requires 3 AA batteries which is included.

I'm doing a review of the Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde. I love this doll. I wish I had this when I was young. It really acts like a live baby. She tells you when she is hungry. She tells you when it is time to play and says I love you. She says thirty different phrases. They are also loud enough to hear but not too loud. You can set her to speak in Spanish or English. I think that is cool that they do that too. She comes with two diapers and one pair of clothes. She comes with three different shaped plastic tools. I think they are used to feed her with or just for play. I'm not sure. One is a green apple, one is an orange carrot and the other one is pink but I'm not sure what it is suppose to be. She comes with two containers of food. The play food must be put back into the container to keep it soft. One is orange. I guess to represent carrots. The other one is green. Maybe it is to represent peas. I don't know for sure. It is just what I think. It is like play dough. It is softer and cooler feeling than clay. That is the only way to explain it. She comes with a roller to roll the food out into small shapes. When you feed her the food she acts like she is eating it. Her mouth moves. Also if you stick your finger in her mouth she says a sound to mean no. I can't spell out the sound. She also comes with a yellow plate and a pretend juice box. You can put it in her mouth and she looks like she is drinking it. Her mouth moves when she is talking but is not moving per syllable. It just moves. Okay now to talk about the food. When you feed her the food it goes into the back of her throat or it comes out goes to into her diaper. There is a straight hole going through her from her throat to her bottom and it just falls out. Some of the food also can stay in her throat. If it does there is a compartment that you can unscrew in the back of her neck to open it. You can get the food out that way. Like I said this is a really cool doll. Any girl would love this doll. My granddaughter certainly does. I recommend this doll to every girl.

My two year old has had this Baby Sara for a little over a week and she loves it so much. She's so amused that she eats and drinks. She takes her baby with her everywhere she goes. Even to Daycare it's a must.

I thinks Sara is the cutest with her big eyes, slightly big head she's just so adorable and I love the fact she speaks English and Spanish since my children are Hispanic that's a plus for me also she’s bigger than any baby alive I’ve seen in stores.. Sara does quite a bit: she talks (so many phrases), responds, eats. The bottle is solid plastic, no liquid, and is pretend. So lo liquids - no mess - no need for new diapers. My next step is to get my baby girl a stroller for her favorite doll.

Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara doll, comes with an outfit, two diapers for changing, 2 1-ounce containers of her own food, 3 shaping tools, a roller, plate, and juice box. The food is similar to play-doh, and the baby will need changing after she eats, just like a real infant. Unlike a real infant, however, Sara will tell her caretaker that she's hungry for a snack or needs to be changed.
The only thing I really don't are for is that her mouth stays open.

Highly Recommend this doll!!!!!

My daughter loves this doll. She has a Baby Alive doll that I bought her a couple years ago but she's been asking for one that actually goes potty so when she saw the doll she was thrilled. As a parent I love that the doll speaks English and Spanish... I'm Puerto Rican but my daughter doesn't know much Spanish so this is a good start, the doll is so easy to understand so that's awesome. I love that the doll includes 10 accessories.... my daughter has fun making her baby food....it comes with 2 small containers of reusable food in the colors green and orange,It feels a lot like play-doh so it's easy to work with and use the shape cutter to make the fruits and vegetables to feed the baby. A fake juice box is also included. You turn her on by pushing her wrist and she say's a lot of things... 30+ phrases, I haven't heard them all because my daughter usually takes off with the doll and that's fine because i'm sure i'd get annoyed from hearing her. The doll also includes 2 changes of diapers that can be used over and over since the doll doesn't wet. The only thing I didn't like is that the food would sometimes stick in her mouth and also sometimes when changing the diaper the play-doh falls out onto the carpet but that's something that can be resolved quick... I just have my daughter lay the doll on a small blanket when she changes her.
This doll is cute and will keep your kids occupied for hours, it was a hit with my nieces as well and I love that there are 3 different dolls ...A blond , a brunette and an African American doll so I will be buying them one and they can all have a different one.

The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde is really cute. She has big blue green eyes, blonde hair, and a cute citrus print dress. So even just as a plain baby doll she is appealing. My 4 year old daughter loves to play mama, because she sees me with her little brothers. This doll gives her the chance to really feed and change her "baby", just like mama. The doll comes with two jars of "food" which is play dough. The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde can tell her when she is hungry, so my daughter can "make" her food and feed her. The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde also can tell my daughter when she needs to be changed (ew, but my daughter loves it), and the doll can tell her when she is sleepy. So my daughter gets to play mama in 3 ways. The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde can also be given pretend juice. It comes with diapers, but I can already see that I'll need to buy more. I'm not sure if they sell them separately, but if not a preemie diaper may fit (and be just a teeny bit big). Cleaning the play dough out is not my favorite job, but it's not horrible. It's worth it Bc my little girl loves to feed her so much. Overall I think that this is a neat doll, and is recommend it to a little girl (or boy) who is interested in parenting role play.

I just received the Blond Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara doll in the mail and my six year old daughter loves her! She has been playing with her ever since we opened the box. This doll comes with 2 diapers, a juice box, one shirt, a pair of shorts, 2 “Baby Alive Solid Doll Food” containers, 3 cookie cutters in different food shapes, a rolling pin (which I forgot to put in the pictures I posted) and a plate. You can make food pieces out of the “Baby Alive Solid Doll Food,” which is pretty much a type of play dough, and you feed them to the baby. Once you put the food in her mouth she eats it, after a couple of pieces, the food is in her diaper and she is ready to be changed. One of the biggest problems with this doll I have is the fact that she doesn’t sit upright by herself very well. My daughter kept trying to sit the doll up but the doll kept falling over, my daughter eventually had to sit her up in a baby stroller she already had. The second problem I have with this doll is that the diaper seems a little small for the doll. I laid the doll down and had to maneuver the diaper a bit to make sure it stayed on, my six-year-old daughter kept having trouble putting it on. I wish the diaper straps were made of Velcro or something else other than tape, I can see the straps not lasting after many opens and closes. This doll has a lot of different phrases she says when you push her bracelet. There two different languages that the doll can speak in, English and Spanish. Bottom line… cute doll but could use a few fixes to make it better.

I was given this Sara doll to review, and I am so happy! I knew this would be perfect for my 7 year old granddaughter. Her mommy is expecting twins in November, so I thought this would be a perfect surprise for her.
Sara's skin feels soft to the touch. She is well structured and I can tell will be a toy that will last and be passed down to the twins. The Sara doll is dressed in a very well-made cute flowered dress.Her legs and arms can be posed and swivel where connected to the body.
There is a switch at the base of her head that turns her off/on. Sara speaks both English or Spanish. Sara tells you when she is sleepy, hungry, thirsty, and when she needs to be changed. Sara speaks 30 plus phrases. Her voice is so 'girlie' cute
A small negative is that her eyes are painted on, so they do not open and close.
The only negative I have to say about this doll is her hair. Up front she has cute pony tails and all looks cute and full. In the back though, was a different story. The hair was so sparse. You can see the the lack of hair and wider spacing. But, being a resourceful grandparent, I took the loose hair from the front, and put in a ponytail in back. Instant fix!
My granddaughter was so thrilled when she received this! Her eyes were the size of saucers, just like the doll Sara's. She pressed out the dough (food) and started making the food shapes. Then when Sara was hungry, she fed her with the spoon. The 'food' goes down her throat and then she needs to be changed because she 'pooped'. The 'food 'is reusable.How much fun my granddaughter had feeding and changing the baby. When Sara is thirsty, you can feed her with her bottle. I think a good feature is that the bottle is solid plastic. this means no liquid,no mess which means no need to purchase new diapers every time she wets.
All and All this is a wonderful gift for your little girl 3 and up. My granddaughter tells me she is practicing change diapers and feeding her baby so she can help her mommy when the twins come. How cute is that. She has only had this doll for a few days, but her mom tells me she doesn't go anywhere without it!
This is a wonderful purchase for little girls.I also appreciated that the accessories, more diapers, food, etc are available online if you need them.
The play food is Wheat based, so if there is allergy problem with Gluten, there are plenty of recipes to make the food on the web

I got the baby alive doll for free to try, and leave my own personal opinions on. This doll is more of a pain than it is fun. First of all you feed the doll playdough. I am a mom to a 4 and 3 yr old and playdoh is annoying. Its hit or miss if the doll actually eats the playdoh or if it gets stuck then you have to fight trying to get it out. The diapers are cheap and the tabs lost their stickyness after the first couple days. I went to replace the diapers and theyre expensive to replace. I am also not sure how I feel about what the doll is teaching kids by feeding it then getting it out of the diaper after she "poops" it out then to feed it to her again. I feel like it would send the wrong message to kids. overall i would not reccomend this doll just for the facts of the playdoh and the diapers and the message it sends kids.

This is Blonde Baby Sara, Super Snacks Snackin', from the Baby Alive collection of somewhat lifelike dolls, designed for little girls to take care of their own little babies. This doll is rather large, has painted eyes and its mouth is open because it's designed to be fed as well as talk. The talking is a very cool feature because she will speak in English or Spanish. Included with the doll is her outfit of course, two containers of doll food, which resembles play doh, 1oz each and they are reusable. Also included is two diapers, shaping tools, a roller plate and a juice box as well as instructions. Baby Sara eats but does not drink. Also there is replacement items available. I'd check online and at the store if you are wanting or needing any.

Our little two year old niece absolutely loves her but there are some parental drawbacks. Sometimes the food gets caught and is kind of hard to get out of her mouth and food or poo from the diaper can get on the floor and it can get messy. Other than that, this doll is so much fun for her. She loves to feed her and even though the Sara's eyes do not close, she loves to put her to bed and sing to her, Very cute. There are some things I'm not too crazy about but there are positives too that override my thoughts. I would recommend but also be aware there may be some aggravation for the parents....

Well, it's a cute baby. My daughters are 5, 8,10. They want a baby sister. I told them I can't be feeding and changing diapers anymore. They said they would do it! So, I got them this doll to see how well they would do. The package says it is suitable for toddlers. It's really not. Hear is why. First of all, the "clay food" has to be flattened and cut for feeding. Some kids can do it, my 5 year old had trouble with it because she either squashed it too thin or not thin enough. Also, the diapers are the "old school" diapers with the sticky tab. Remember those? If you did it wrong, you had to get the tape out. Same thing here. I did show them how the sticky part had to stay on the clear plastic and be closed up during "changings" but it still lost the stickiness pretty fast. Not nice to have a sagging diaper. Also, the pants are way too tight. We had trouble removing the pants without the diaper, and putting them on with the diaper was a very big hassle, even for me. My girls all love the baby, even with the issues, but don't play with her that much because it gets boring. The doll recognizes when you try feeding her and she doesn't want any. The doll can recognize the difference between juice and food. Aside from that, the phrases are on a repeating loop. It will say she is hungry and will jump to the next phrase while they are still trying to cut the food up. Or she wont wait for them to finish changing the diaper before she's asking for more food. It's a loop and my girls think it gets boring. Finally, they all had an issue with the doll eating her own poop. Yeah. You feed the food, it just falls straight onto the diaper through a large cavity that runs from the throat to the diaper. When you change the diaper, you are suppose to get the poop and put it back on the food cup. Explain that to a toddler. My girls are older, and after a few hours of "ewe", they got used to it. I would recommend this doll, but not to children who have yet to master potty training.

I have been a fan of Baby Alive since I was young and I am glad I can now share her with my own daughter. The Super Snack Snackin’ Sara doll is very cute and it is actually bigger than I thought it looked online, which is great. This doll is the perfect gift for that little girl in your life that likes to play mommy! My daughter is still a little young to fully enjoy all the features of the doll like changing her diaper but she does like playing with the doll itself. She also likes the fact that it talks and it tells when it’s hungry and when it’s ready for naptime. I think I have given my niece a different Baby Alive doll as a gift for the past three Christmases and she loves them. This one would definitely make a great gift for this Christmas! The doll eats and comes with reusable “food” and cookie cutter type things to cut out the “food” into different food shapes. Then the “food” comes out in the diaper and it can then be stored in the little containers to be reused. She also comes with a little juice box. Great doll, we love it!

This doll is a “no” for me. The concept or idea is AMAZING! I love the thought of feeding the baby and this then combines the fun of Play-Doh type material (like clay) with doll play! And the juice box is cute, too. The details put on the doll (see my photo of Sara Dolly’s little bracelet on her wrist) are modern and cute (not entirely sure about her mouth shape, but the food “fits”).

However, the “food” for Sara Dolly (the Play-Doh) can’t be used by the age listed for the doll. The age listed is eighteen months and up, I would never, ever trust an eighteen month old child with Play-Doh anywhere but right at the table with my help and assistance (my carpets, my child’s hair, etc.). I am also really concerned that the clay or Play-Doh will get “gummed up” in the Sara Dolly’s belly (I am guessing it will dry out and still “come out”; but too much might just clog everything up). Further, the diapers are expensive but very cheap material. If this doll is something you REALLY want to try, teach your child about cloth diapers! Eco friendly- yay!!

The doll is an overall “no” for me.

So this doll it pretty neat. It will provide hours and hours of fun for any child. Not only is it a toy any girl will love, but it is also a great learning device for young children learning to potty train, or any older child learning the responsibilities of taking care of a baby. You feed it the food it comes with and it swallows it. Then it shows up in the diaper and then the doll tells you it needs changed. That gives the child a very real simulation of what happens when you feed a baby and what needs to be done to clean it up. It comes with two diapers to reuse over and over. This doll has many things it says and also speaks Spanish. It comes with a juice box, two diapers, a roller for the dough, 3 food cutters and a plate to serve the food on. You squeeze the bracelet to make her talk. I recommend this to any parent looking for a fun educational toy for their children.

The Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin' Sara Doll, Blonde, is just about the cutest toy doll I have ever seen! When my 6 year old daughter held her for the first time, she was ecstatic with joy! She promptly named her doll, Lucinda, and said, "I'm a mommy!"
My 8 year old son is quite enthralled with the doll as well. He asked his sister to show him how to feed and change the diapers, and then he declared, "I'm a good daddy!" A toy that can help my son develop good character traits such as caring for others, empathy, and responsibility is a toy I can get behind!
The food is similar to play-dough consistency. It goes right down the doll's mouth, chute, and out the bottom. It will fill the diaper, and the doll will tell you she needs to be changed--so darling! Her mouth actually opens and closes with motorized action, and a pretend juice box can be held up to her like a bottle when she is not feeding.
The diapers are rather poorly made. I will probably go buy some real diapers if I can find preemie sized ones to replace the two that come with the doll. A little diaper bag to hold all of the doll's items would also have been a nice addition to the set. I gave my daughter a little plastic bag with a zipper closure to hold all of the items so she can take her baby anywhere and everywhere!
This doll is far superior to my old Baby Alive from 40 years ago! This doll actually talks to her 'mommy' and is very well-behaved, or so says my daughter! There is even a switch on the doll that allows it to speak in Spanish!

My 3 ½ year old daughter loves little Baby Alive, Super Snacks Snackin’ Sara. The doll is pretty solid and big but that doesn’t stop my daughter from carrying her around the house and giving her lots of hugs. The doll says quite a few things and my daughter is thrilled to have a baby doll that speaks to her and tells her what she needs. Little Baby Alive tells my daughter that she is thirsty and my daughter is ready with her juice. When the baby says she is hungry you can feed her the reusable food (think play doh). She actually can ‘eat’ it and then needs a diaper changing (play doh falls out below). The diaper and pants are a little hard to put on for a 3 ½ year old but she is catching on. The only thing that really is difficult is even though the doll is posable, she doesn’t sit up on her own. Since my daughter plays mostly on the ground with her, I showed her how to prop the doll up against the wall or against her kitchen set. If you have a play stroller or high chair it would work great with this doll. My daughter loves playing mommy with this doll and I believe this would be a great Christmas gift idea for a 3 to 6 year old!

This doll is so cute. It's a great size and comes with a few accessories. I'm just concerned that the food may get stuck as the doll is 'eating' it. I guess time will tell. My daughter loves it and thinks it is like having a real baby that she gets to tend to. Feed, change diapers, repeat. It keeps her occupied while I cook dinner so I'm happy!

Baby Alive Super Snacks Snackin’ Sara Blonde is really cute. It is rated for 3+ years of age and I think it is appropriate as taking care of this doll requires a little responsibility. The doll comes with “doll food” that resembles play-doh as well as tools to make the food into all kind of healthy snack choices. Since the doll also expels the food included are two reusable diapers. The only think I am not a big fan of is the fact that the doll’s mouth stay open in default position. Because of the food’s consistency it is important to teach your child where they can prepare it as well as a proper place to change the diapers. I suggest a designated blanket/changing station in an area without carpets. Children have a tendency to drop things and play-doh has tendency to ruin carpets so I recommend separating the two. The doll talks if you squeeze her wrist but you do have to use some pressure and it is possible that not all 3 year-olds would be able to push it hard enough. The doll will ask for a snack and to be changed. I think it is a great tool to use when you are preparing a child for a pet and trying to teach him or her about responsibilities of feeding and cleaning after one.

Got this doll as part of the spark reviewer program to review and it is adorable. Didn't realize how big the doll actually was until receiving her in the mail. My daughter and niece will love these doll. Definitely worth the money and definitely a nice doll from Baby Alive, our favorite brands of baby dolls.
