Could you use a Personal Loan?




Sometimes you just need some extra money. Maybe your credit card interest rates are through the roof, you need to make a major purchase or something unexpected happens. That’s when a personal loan can really help. Use your loan to consolidate debts, cover medical bills, or make some home improvements, or even improve your credit.
Personal Loan Rates as low as 5.99% APR! 
Whatever your reasons, if you need some more money right now – from $1,000 up to $35,000 - LendingTree can help steer you in the right direction.
Improve Your Credit!
A personal loan can help you build or improve your credit by adding another line of credit to your credit report. Your lender will report your monthly payments to the three credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. To improve your credit, make sure you make all of your payments on time and never miss a payment. With consistent, on-time payments, you'll start to see your credit score improve over time.
View free offers now 




What is a personal loan?
A personal loan, also called a signature loan, is an unsecured loan, which means you can borrow money with no collateral based on your credit. From consolidating debt to financing a purchase to improving your credit, people choose personal loans because interest rates are usually lower than credit cards, which can save you thousands of dollars.

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

                    I was looking for a personal loan and ended up on the Lending Tree website. After entering my information, I received quite a few offers. When I made my choice and followed the instructions, I had my loan approved the next day and my money within a week. I recommend Lending Tree. Give it a try. There is no obligation if you decide you don't want a loan.

I borrowed a small loan to pay off a loan with almost 300% interest! I went from a $300/mo. payment to a $168/mo. payment. The transaction was as easy as 1-2-3. Money was in my checking account within 48 hours! Now I can clean up my credit. Thank you Lending Tree!

Unbelievable experience

I cannot imagine a simpler process to get access to funds. After a 10 day (or so) process, I had cash in my account and refinanced debt that has been building over the course of 6 years. I finally feel like I will be able to be debt free when the loan is paid off. 10/10 would do again.

I recently closed a personal loan that reduced my interest rate significantly and the experience was so positive I used LendingTree for re-financing my home as well. Great service

After trying many different routes to consolidating credit card debt, I finally turned to Lending Tree. Only wish I had done it sooner. The entire process was easy and straightforward and within a short period of time, the entire amount I requested was in my bank account. This is such a relief for me since I was able to pay off four different credit cards and now pay a much smaller amount each month. Thanks, Lending Tree!

5 Things To Know About Personal Loans
Sometimes, personal expenses simply outweigh your income and savings. You may have taken a vacation that cost much more than you anticipated, you need to pay for a few college classes to be more competitive for a promotion, or you may be a teacher who is forced to spend hundreds of dollars of money on classroom supplies at the beginning of the year. There are plenty of different situations where unexpected or needed expenses may arise and exceed the current amount of money in your bank account.
Personal loans can fill the financial gap. These loans can be used for just about anything and you can receive anywhere between $1,000 to $50,000 in a matter of a couple days. While a loan that provides quick cash may be tempting, here are four things you need to know first about how to get a personal loan.
Will you qualify
Most likely, yes. Anyone with decent credit can be approved for a personal loan quickly. If you don't qualify on your first attempt at getting a personal loan, take steps to improve your credit, such as paying bills on time and monitoring your credit report to check for any errors or faults with your financial spending.
What you can use it for
Personal loans can be used for anything unless the lender sets guidelines on how it may be spent. However, that doesn't mean a personal loan should be used for anything.
The best way to use a personal loan is to integrate it into your overall financial plan. If you are anticipating big expenses, such as a house renovation or a college tuition payment, getting a personal loan could benefit you in the long run because you are investing in something of long-term value. A college education could help you or your child get a higher-paying job. Fixing up your house could significantly increase its value.
Getting a personal loan also can help you pay off debts. Credit cards balances, for example, are high-interest loans as long as you carry a balance. A personal debt consolidation loan will pay off a credit card and other high-interest debts, leaving you with one, more affordable payment.
What you shouldn't use it for
Be cautious about getting a personal loan to pay for expenses that won't benefit you financially in the long-term. A lavish dream wedding, for example, may be fun for a few hours but will leave you with years of debt. A clothing shopping spree may give you a great wardrobe, but you may be paying off the personal loan years after the clothes are out of style. When you're spending part of your monthly budget on a personal loan payment, you're also robbing yourself of the opportunity to save money or invest in your retirement.
They come with interest rates and fees
Because personal loans generally are unsecured, borrowers don't have to make a security deposit or provide collateral. This increases the lender's risk, which translates into higher interest rates than secured loans. A borrower's credit score will also come into play, so a high score may help you qualify for a low interest rate.
While getting a personal loan sometimes can be done without fees, some lenders do charge origination or other fees for borrowing. Be wary of these vendors, and be sure to check around for the best rates.
Getting the Best Rate
Once you've decided to apply for a personal loan, do your homework and shop among lenders for the best rates and lowest fees. Make sure the terms are favorable and consider a short-term loan, as you'll pay less in interest fees than a long-term loan for the same amount.

Debt consolidation can make life easier




Do you feel like your life is on hold because you’re trapped by all your debt payments? If so, you’re not alone. Consolidating your debt could be the answer you’re looking for. It can help lower your monthly payments and get you out of debt faster so you can be in the driver’s seat of your own finances. With so many ways to consolidate, there’s bound to be a solution for your unique situation.
What is debt consolidation?
Debt consolidation is the process of combining your debts into one loan with a lower interest rate. Instead of having multiple debt payments each month, you’ll only have one. This simplifies your bill-paying process each month plus reduces the total amount you owe to your creditors.

Is debt consolidation right for you?




            Balance Transfer            



            Cash-out Refinancing            



            Home Equity Loans            



            Personal Loans            



            Student Loan Consolidation            














Pros of balance transfers

The interest rate can be very low. Average introductory rate for balance transfer cards is about 2.5 percent.
Only one account to keep track of.
Application and approval is quick and painless.
Upfront fees are low.





Cons of balance transfers

You may not qualify for the advertised intro rate if your credit scores are not excellent.
There is typically a balance transfer fee.
The interest rate can spike if you’re 60 days late on your payment. That rate could be much higher than the rates of the accounts you paid off.
The introductory rate is good for a limited time, then increases.
















Pros of Cash-out Refinancing

Because the loan is secured by your home, the interest rate is much lower than that of debt like credit card balances.
The interest may be tax deductible (check with a tax pro).
You can lower your monthly payment significantly, because home mortgages can have much longer terms. Stretching out your credit card debt with a ten-to thirty-year loan really lowers drops your payment.
You can get a better rate than that of your old mortgage





Cons of Cash-out Refinancing

The loan is secured by your home, so if you can’t make the payment, you could end up in foreclosure.
Credit card debt can be discharged in a bankruptcy because it’s unsecured. Once that debt is secured by a home, you can’t discharge it with Chapter 7 filing.
Credit card debt can be discharged in a bankruptcy because it’s unsecured. Once that debt is secured by a home, you can’t discharge it with a Chapter 7 filing.
Cash-out refinances take time. There’s an application, an appraisal, a title search, etc.
Cash-out refinancing has higher upfront costs than any other strategy. It’s a good solution only if the new loan has better terms than the mortgage it replaces.
Stretching out your repayment can increase your total interest expense, even if the interest rate is lower. This can be prevented by making extra principal payments to lower your balance.
















Pros of Home Equity Loans

Because the loan is secured by your property, the interest rate is lower.
The interest is most likely tax deductible.
Replacing multiple accounts with variable rates, like credit cards, with a single fixed rate loan makes managing debt easier.
Home equity loans have much lower costs than cash-out refinances and can be processed much more quickly.
Stretching out your debt repayment over more years can substantially lower your payment.





Cons of Home Equity Loans

If you’re unable to make the payment, you could end up in foreclosure.
Debt moved from unsecured accounts to a mortgage (which is what home equity debt is) can no longer be discharged in bankruptcy. If your finances are shaky, a mortgage is probably not your safest choice.
Stretching out your debt over a longer timeframe may increase the total interest cost, even if the interest rate is lower. This can be avoided by accelerating your repayment with extra principal payments.
















Pros of Personal Loans

Personal loans almost always have fixed interest rates, making budgeting easier.
Application and processing are very fast. You can often get a personal loan in one day.
Personal loan fees are much lower than those of home equity loans or cash-out refinances.
Terms range from one to five years, so you become debt-free faster.
Personal loans can be discharged in a bankruptcy.





Cons of Personal Loans

Personal loans are unsecured, so their interest rates are higher than those of home equity loans or cash-out refinances.
Because terms are shorter, payments are higher.
If your credit isn’t very good, you may not be able to get a lower rate than you’re currently paying on your credit cards.
















Pros of Student Loan Consolidation

Borrowers can lock in a lower interest rate.
Make just one student loan payment each month rather than multiple.
Pay less in interest overall, assuming a lower rate and lower term.
More flexible terms means borrowers can extend their terms for a smaller monthly payment.
Lock in a low, fixed interest rate.





Cons of Student Loan Consolidation

Students who consolidate may no longer qualify for federal loan forgiveness programs.
The term may be longer, making the total amount in interest paid higher.
Borrowers with poor credit could get a worse interest rate than they have now.
Switching from a fixed to a variable rate could mean you pay more down the line if interest rates go up.

Loan Type:
Home Purchase
Home Refinance








Home Price:
?

Home Price (Purchase)
When you get a mortgage to purchase a home, the lender uses the lower of the agreed-upon purchase price or the property's appraised value to determine your maximum loan amount. The loan amount divided by the property home price equals your loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. That ratio is one of the major factors that lenders use to set your mortgage rate. If your LTV exceeds 80 percent, you'll probably be required to pay mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment. If the property appraises for less than the agreed-on purchase price, you are not usually required to complete the purchase.

Home Value:
?

Home Value (Refinance)
This is your estimate of the current value of your property. When you refinance, your home is almost always evaluated by a licensed appraiser. The refinance loan amount divided by the property's appraised value equals your loan-to-value ratio (LTV), and that number is one of the major factors that determine your mortgage rate. To get an accurate refinance rate quote, your home value estimate must be reasonably accurate. 





Down Payment:
?

Down Payment
The down payment is the amount you pay upfront when you finance property. Your purchase price minus your down payment equals your mortgage amount. The higher your down payment, the more likely you are to be approved for a home loan. If your down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price, you'll probably be required to pay for mortgage insurance, which increases your monthly payment.

Mortgage Balance:




Home Type:
Single Family
Town House
Condo
Multifamily
Co-op



Credit Score:
?

Credit Score
Your credit score is a number designed to measure your credit-worthiness. It's based on a formula that combines many factors, including your payment history, amount of credit used and number of accounts. This number is used by lenders to calculate the probability that you'll default on your mortgage. Most lenders won't approve mortgages to applicants with credit scores lower than 620. Your credit score is one of the most important factors that determines your mortgage rate - applicants with higher scores are offered better mortgage rates.

Mortgage Rate Lock Recommendation
July 25, 2017 - Lock
Today's Outlook
Judging from early market trends, it is looking as if mortgage rates might rise today, perhaps appreciably. However, those trends frequently change speed or direction during the day. So a shallower rise, a holding steady or even a fall all remain possible. Our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic, political, and geopolitical news that might affect the American and global economies, including market skittishness as a two-day meeting of the Federal Reserve committee that determines many interest rates begins today. While few expect a rate-hike announcement tomorrow, investors pay close attention to these events. In addition, the U.S. Treasury will be auctioning notes and bills in two auctions today, and D.C. politics are less than calm. If we were currently buying a home, we would lock our rate now, especially if we had to lock anyway in the next couple of weeks. Read on to discover why you might prefer to float.
Average rates for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages held steady yesterday, remaining at a low for July. However, they remain noticeably higher than at some times earlier in the year, and a little above the levels seen toward the end of June. Rates could fall further but there is no guarantee of that. What happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming days. Absent other factors, good news tends to push mortgage rates up, while bad news usually pulls them down.
Many experts would urge you to lock now, particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks. Others might suggest you continue to float, providing you have time to ride out the coming near-inevitable ups and downs. They perceive June's and early July's rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli (to do with government bond markets in Europe) rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying U.S. economy. But neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility. So, either way, you are taking a chance. Only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable.

 Mortgage Rates Look Likely to Fall or Hold Steady Today


What Does it Mean to "Lock" Your Mortgage?
"Locking" your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan. Once your loan is locked, that's the rate and price you get, regardless of what happens in the financial markets. If rates go up, you're protected but if rates go down, you won't benefit either -- you close your loan at the rate you've locked and you can’t change it. Locks have expiration dates ranging from 30 to 60 days or more, and the longer your lock period, the more it costs. If you don't close your loan on time, you could end up paying a higher interest rate.
When Should You Lock?
You can lock in your loan at any time during the process. Until you lock your interest rate, you are said to be "floating" your mortgage. The only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance.
The decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice. That’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know.






Mortgage Types

			The type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for. See below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for.

Conventional Mortgage

	A conventional mortgage is one that is not insured by a government agency, such as HUD/FHA. It's typically a fixed-rate 30-year loan and the buyer must put down at least 20 percent of the purchase price of the home to qualify. Conventional mortgages typically come with excellent mortgage rates because of the down payment and stringent credit score requirements.

FHA Mortgage

	FHA mortgages are perfect for buyers with less than 20 percent down, a less-than-ideal credit score or first-time home buyers. Since these loans are backed and insured by the federal government, lenders are able to offer low, competitive rates to buyers. You can view current, up-to-date rates from our top-rated FHA lenders to see what type of rate you'd be eligible for.

VA Mortgage

	VA mortgages are reserved for veterans, active-duty personnel, Reservist/National Guard members, and their eligible surviving spouses. VA loans are incredibly attractive to those that qualify because of their no down payment requirement, no mortgage insurance premiums, low closing costs and low, negotiable interest rates.

Mortgage Process

			LendingTree makes getting a mortgage easy! Below are the steps to take to make your mortgage process as seamless as possible:


Determine how much house you can afford
View your credit score and improve it, if need be
Figure out which type of loan is right for you
Determine your down payment amount
Shop different lenders on LendingTree to guarantee you get the best rate possible

How Much House Can I Afford?

			Use our Home Affordability Calculator to see how much house you can afford. Simply plug in your gross annual income, down payment amount, monthly debts and credit score. Our calculator will give you a range of conservative home prices up to aggressive ones.




Mortgage Rates by State




            Mortgage rates can vary a lot between lenders on any given day. So, if you only get one mortgage quote, you won't have any idea if there's a better deal out there. That's why the best way to get a mortgage rate it to request quotes from multiple lenders and compare interest rates, loan terms and closing costs. It puts you on in charge and keeps the banks competing to get you the best rate possible. Remember, even .1 percent can amount to thousands of dollars over the course of a loan. Make sure you shop around!

LendingTree Acquires MagnifyMoney To Continue Diversification - LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ:TREE) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»LendingTree Acquires MagnifyMoney To Continue DiversificationJun.21.17 | About: LendingTree, Inc. (TREE) Donovan Jones IPOs, tech, alternative investments, CEO VentureDeal.comVentureDealSummaryLendingTree has acquired financial comparison site MagnifyMoney for up to $39.5 million in cash and contingent consideration.The deal represents a continuation of TREE's diversification strategy away from just being a consumer finance marketplace.Investors view the strategy as a positive, and are pushing up the stock in response.



 Quick Take Online loan marketplace LendingTree (TREE) has acquired financial services comparison site MagnifyMoney for $39.5 million in upfront and contingent consideration. MagnifyMoney has created an information resource for consumers to compare various financial products and become more educated in the process. With the deal, LendingTree is continuing its diversification strategy away from being a pure lending marketplace, and investors like the approach so far. Target Company New York-based MagnifyMoney was founded in 2014 to provide consumers with a resource to make side-by-side comparisons of credit- and banking-based products and generate product suggestions via its recommendation engine. Company founders were Nick Clements and Brian Karimzad. Clements had previously been a managing director at Barclaycard UK Consumer. Karimzad had been a VP at Goldman Sachs (GS) before co-founding the firm. Below is a brief demo video about MagnifyMoney’s service:  (Source: MagnifyMoney) MagnifyMoney makes the majority of its revenues from affiliate referrals from some of the products that it reviews.
 Management takes pains to state that it has complete editorial control over its reviews and does not receive payment from reviewed services to appear in their product recommendations. The site also provides educational guides, various calculators, and other financial product categories such as credit monitoring and financial budgeting. Acquisition Terms and Rationale LendingTree is paying up to $39.5 million, comprised of $29.5 million in upfront cash and $10 million in the form of restricted stock unit [RSUs] awards based on achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones. In addition, the two founders were awarded 19,234 RSUs each, for a total of $6.96 million in current value. As of LendingTree’s March 31, 2017, 10-Q, the company had $109.5 million in cash, equivalents, and restricted cash; it had total liabilities of $108.8 million, so appears to have ample resources to acquire MagnifyMoney without adverse financial effect. The deal represents the second acquisition of financial comparison sites in recent months by LendingTree, having acquired CompareCards (Iron Horse Holdings) in November 2016 for up to $130 million in cash. LendingTree is continuing to diversify its approach, away from acting as a consumer loans marketplace and toward creating a consumer financial information media brand. As LendingTree CEO Doug Lebda stated in the deal announcement,    The acquisition of MagnifyMoney is a continuation of LendingTree's disciplined acquisition strategy and accelerates our product and marketing channel diversification efforts. The MagnifyMoney team has built a successful content platform by generating organic search traffic through unbiased editorial content, a technique that complements LendingTree's core business and value proposition while engaging more consumers. The successful integration we've achieved with the CompareCards acquisition gives us increased confidence in further expanding our portfolio with the addition of MagnifyMoney and its seasoned team.  In a rising interest rate environment, marketplace lenders and operator have felt the pinch as rates for their financing capabilities have increased.
 Additionally, their vaunted ability to more accurately assess creditworthiness has come under some question. So, LendingTree’s diversification efforts continue, and appear to be well received by stock market investors. Responding to the announcement, TREE was up 3.84% as investors are betting the diversification strategy will succeed. Since management has successfully integrated CompareCards, look for more of the same with MagnifyMoney, and potentially for more acquisitions in the space. I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

CHARLOTTE, N.C., June 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ:    TREE) announced today that its subsidiary, LendingTree, LLC has acquired the company that operates MagnifyMoney.com, a leading consumer-facing media property that offers unbiased editorial content, expert commentary, tools and resources to help consumers compare financial products and make informed financial decisions. 








"The acquisition of MagnifyMoney is a continuation of LendingTree's disciplined acquisition strategy and accelerates our product and marketing channel diversification efforts," said Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree. "The MagnifyMoney team has built a successful content platform by generating organic search traffic through unbiased editorial content, a technique that complements LendingTree's core business and value proposition while engaging more consumers. The successful integration we've achieved with the CompareCards acquisition gives us increased confidence in further expanding our portfolio with the addition of MagnifyMoney and its seasoned team." 
"We are incredibly excited to join LendingTree," said Nick Clements, co-founder of MagnifyMoney and former managing director at Barclaycard UK. "Given LendingTree's emphasis on consumer empowerment and transparency, we feel confident that this is the right platform for MagnifyMoney and its editorial team to engage more consumers on a broader set of financial products." 
The acquisition purchase has a possible total consideration of $39.5 million, which consists of $29.5 million in cash at closing, and contingent consideration payments of up to $10 million. The contingent consideration shall be payable in the form of restricted stock unit awards; two of such restricted stock unit awards are described in further detail below under the heading "Inducement Awards".
Inducement Awards: In connection with the acquisition of MagnifyMoney, on June 20, 2017, the company granted restricted stock unit awards to two key employees of MagnifyMoney under its 2017 Inducement Grant Plan as a material inducement to entering into employment with the company. Nick Clements received 19,234 restricted stock units and Brian Karimzad received 19,234 restricted stock units. These restricted stock units will vest, if at all, on the basis of performance conditions related to the performance of the company's combined editorial content business following the acquisition. The awards provide for accelerated vesting in the event of certain events. The awards were approved in accordance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5635(c)(4), which requires a public announcement of these awards. 
About MagnifyMoney:MagnifyMoney was launched in 2014 by Nick Clements and Brian Karimzad. Nick has nearly 15 years of experience working at top banking institutions, including Citigroup and Barclaycard, where he ran the UK consumer credit card business. Brian has also worked in banking and consumer marketing for 15 years.  MagnifyMoney.com offers consumers a powerful resource with its personalized, side-by-side comparisons of banking and credit-based products in a free, unbiased and easy-to-navigate interface. With its proprietary Magnify Transparency Score, banking and credit card products are graded based on simplicity and fee structure, making it simple for consumers to quickly evaluate which products have the least amount of fine print and most consumer-friendly terms. MagnifyMoney is headquartered in New York, NY.

Press Release



LendingTree Acquires CompareCards 



By Megan Greuling
November 16, 2016










LendingTree expands online presence in credit cards with a leading credit card comparison shopping platform  

                CHARLOTTE, N.C., (November 16, 2016) -  LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE) announced today that it has acquired Iron Horse Holdings, LLC, which does business under the name CompareCards.  CompareCards is a leading online source for side-by-side credit card comparison, comprehensive credit education and credit health management. CompareCards provides consumers with one centralized location for pertinent credit card information needed to find the best card for their needs.
 
"CompareCards has an established reputation as a leader in the online credit card comparison industry with solid issuer relationships and un-matched expertise in credit card search engine marketing,” said Doug Lebda, founder and CEO of LendingTree. “We continue to execute on our strategy, leveraging LendingTree’s brand and industry-leading position to further diversify and expand in other financial service categories. We strongly believe that Compare Cards’ technology platform, established issuer relationships and expert industry knowledge will accelerate our growth and further expand our presence in the online credit card comparison shopping industry.”

"We are very pleased to join the LendingTree team and excited about our future together," said Chris Mettler, Founder and President of CompareCards. “We are confident that our core competencies, particularly as it relates to consumers with prime credit, will enhance LendingTree’s ability to capture meaningful market share in the credit card vertical.”

The equity purchase has a possible total consideration of $130 million, which consists of $85 million in cash at closing (to be adjusted for working capital and transaction expenses), and contingent consideration payments of up to $22.5 million in each of 2017 and 2018, subject to achieving specified growth targets.

Key Financial Metrics
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, CompareCards delivered:
-       Revenue:  $54.1 million
-       EBITDA:  $11.3 million

“We are particularly excited about the accelerating profitability of CompareCards in 2016, driven by sustainable technology and breakthrough marketing performance,” said Gabe Dalporto, Chief Financial Officer of LendingTree. “We’ve been extremely disciplined in our M&A methodology, focusing on identifying strategic and affordable acquisitions opportunities. This acquisition continues our diversification strategy, and giving effect to the acquisition as if it occurred at the beginning of the year, results in pro forma non-mortgage revenue of 51 percent of total for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We believe that CompareCards’ consistent, high-quality traffic, talented team and highly-regarded reputation will be complementary to our business, and we’re confident that this transaction will be significantly and immediately accretive to LendingTree. We will provide updated 2017 guidance at our Investor Day on December 13th.”

LendingTree will host a conference call to discuss the transaction and answer analysts’ questions on November 17, 2016 at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (ET). Those interested in accessing the toll-free call may dial (877) 606-1416. Callers outside the United States and Canada may dial (707) 287-9313. A live audiocast will be available to the public and can be accessed via LendingTree’s investor relations website at http://investors.lendingtree.com.

Vista Point Advisors, a San Francisco based boutique investment bank, acted as the exclusive financial advisor to CompareCards.

LendingTree, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TREE): What Are The Technicals Saying About This Dividend Darling?









LendingTree, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TREE) currently has a 10 year dividend growth rate of 0.00%. This number is calculated using the geometric average which provides the typical value of dividend growth over the specified period using the product of their values. The geometric average is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. Solid dividend growth may be one sign of a healthy stock. Investors may be watching different time periods to assess dividend growth rates.
LendingTree, Inc. shares currently have an 8-year dividend growth rate of 0.00%, a 5 year of 0.00%, and a 3 year of 0.00%.
Free Cash Flow or FCF, may be used to gauge the true profitability of a company. FCF measures the amount of cash a company generates after accounting for capital expenditures, and it may be a useful indicator for assessing financial performance. LendingTree, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TREE)‘s FCF growth is presently at 25.037518. 
This is calculated by subtracting FCF from the previous year from FCF this year, divided by FCF from last year. The company has an FCF score of 18.081571. 
The FCF score is an indicator that is derived by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. In general, a higher FCF score value would signal high free cash flow growth. 
The current FCF quality score is 2.073372. The free quality score assists with estimating free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this number, a lower ratio is typically preferred.
 Looking a bit further, the company has an FCF yield of 0.010986, and a 5-year average FCF yield of 0.012047. The first is simply FCF divided by enterprise value, and the second is the five year average FCF divided by the current enterprise value.
SMA CrossTechnical traders and investors may be looking at the simple moving average 50/200 cross on shares of LendingTree, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TREE). At the time of writing, the SMA 50/200 Cross value is 1.37963.
 If the value is greater than one, the 50 day moving average is above the 200 day moving average, which may signal positive stock price momentum. A value less than one would indicate that the 50 day moving average is below the 200 day, which may indicate negative share price momentum.
RangeInvestors often keep track of key stock price levels when doing equity research. Two standard levels are the 52-week high and 52-week low. Shares tend to come under increased scrutiny when approaching either of the two marks. After a recent check, the current stock price divided by the 52-week high for shares of LendingTree, Inc. (NasdaqGS:TREE), gives us a value of 0.954.

LendingTree is an online lending exchange that connects consumers with multiple lenders, banks, and credit partners who compete for business. LendingTree is not a direct supplier of loans; it is instead a broker. Since being founded in 1998 LendingTree has facilitated more than 32 million loan requests[citation needed]. It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
LendingTree also provides financing tools, comparative loan searches and borrowing information.[2]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
After graduating from Bucknell University, Doug Lebda went to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Pittsburgh as an auditor and consultant. When he decided to purchase his first home and obtain a mortgage, he found the process of visiting multiple banks and combing through mortgage offers frustrating, time consuming, and exhausting. Lebda realized that if the process was that difficult for someone with his financial acumen, then there must be a massive market of others with the same desire for a better way. With this idea, Doug founded CreditSource USA in 1996 with Jamey Bennett, whom he knew from Bucknell and had previous experience founding BookWire. The new company was later rebranded as LendingTree and by 1998, LendingTree launched nationally online with its headquarters in Charlotte, NC.[3]
Growth[edit]
LendingTree went through a successful IPO on February 15, 2000. Bennett would leave LendingTree after the IPO.
In May 2003, LendingTree, LLC was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, former owner of Ticketmaster, Home Shopping Network and current owner of Match.com. In 2004, LendingTree acquired HomeLoanCenter.com and formed LendingTree Loans.[citation needed]
After 5 years, LendingTree spun off from IAC to join newly established Tree.com, Inc. Tree.com is now the parent company of several brands and businesses in the financial services and real estate industries including LendingTree.com; GetSmart.com; DegreeTree.com; LendingTreeAutos.com; and DoneRight.com.[4]
In 2015 LendingTree disassembled the Tree.com umbrella to focus on its core brand, LendingTree which now incorporates Business Loans, Personal Loans, Debt Consolidation, Free Credit Scores, and Student Loans along with its core mortgage products Home Loans, Mortgage Refinance, and Home Equity.[5]

LendingTree is an online lending exchange that connects consumers with multiple lenders, banks, and credit partners who compete for business. LendingTree is not a direct supplier of loans; it is instead a broker. Since being founded in 1998 LendingTree has facilitated more than 32 million loan requests[citation needed]. It is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.
LendingTree also provides financing tools, comparative loan searches and borrowing information.[2]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
After graduating from Bucknell University, Doug Lebda went to work for PricewaterhouseCoopers in Pittsburgh as an auditor and consultant. When he decided to purchase his first home and obtain a mortgage, he found the process of visiting multiple banks and combing through mortgage offers frustrating, time consuming, and exhausting. Lebda realized that if the process was that difficult for someone with his financial acumen, then there must be a massive market of others with the same desire for a better way. With this idea, Doug founded CreditSource USA in 1996 with Jamey Bennett, whom he knew from Bucknell and had previous experience founding BookWire. The new company was later rebranded as LendingTree and by 1998, LendingTree launched nationally online with its headquarters in Charlotte, NC.[3]
Growth[edit]
LendingTree went through a successful IPO on February 15, 2000. Bennett would leave LendingTree after the IPO.
In May 2003, LendingTree, LLC was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, former owner of Ticketmaster, Home Shopping Network and current owner of Match.com. In 2004, LendingTree acquired HomeLoanCenter.com and formed LendingTree Loans.[citation needed]
After 5 years, LendingTree spun off from IAC to join newly established Tree.com, Inc. Tree.com is now the parent company of several brands and businesses in the financial services and real estate industries including LendingTree.com; GetSmart.com; DegreeTree.com; LendingTreeAutos.com; and DoneRight.com.[4]
In 2015 LendingTree disassembled the Tree.com umbrella to focus on its core brand, LendingTree which now incorporates Business Loans, Personal Loans, Debt Consolidation, Free Credit Scores, and Student Loans along with its core mortgage products Home Loans, Mortgage Refinance, and Home Equity.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
