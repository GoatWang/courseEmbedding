David Cordani






President and CEO, Cigna Corporation
David Cordani became President and CEO of Cigna in 2009 and has spearheaded its transformation into a leading global health service company, doubling the size of the company in five years. He is a prominent voice addressing key health challenges, such as the empowering of individuals to manage their own health, innovating new health delivery models focused on patients’ health improvements, and partnering with physicians to focus on wellness, and improving clinical quality.
With operations and capabilities in more than 30 countries, Cordani leads Cigna's more than 39,000 employees in improving the health, well-being and sense of security of more than 90 million customer relationships. 
Under Cordani's leadership, Cigna has:

Delivered nearly 15% compounded annual growth for both revenue and adjusted income from operations (2009-2013).
Successfully integrated a series of significant global acquisitions, including the $3.8 billion purchase of HealthSpring (now Cigna-HealthSpring), which gave Cigna one million new customer relationships in the growing seniors segment.
Expanded the company's operations in China and South Korea, while launching joint ventures in Turkey and India, giving Cigna strategic footholds in these high-growth markets. 

Prior to joining Cigna, Cordani was with Coopers & Lybrand. He actively works with March of Dimes, The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the Achilles International Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans and is a charter board member of ChildObesity180. Cordani was named to the General Mills Board of Directors in 2014 and to the U.S.-India Business Council Board of Directors in 2015.
Cordani is an accomplished triathlete, having competed in more than 125 triathlons. He earned his bachelor's degree from Texas A&M, and an MBA from the University of Hartford.

All statistics are based on Cigna internal data.

Was this review helpful?




I wear average 8.5, ordered this is in 39, fit was spot on. I ordered the blush suede which is a soft, light pinkish sand. It is comfortable and fairly easy to walk in. Feels secure. My toes seem to get caught on some of the woven details, but not too much. Cordani is a quality shoe, and I paid full price, have not worn them yet, and they are $75 off now, I wonder if Zappos makes adjustments and in what time frame?

Wow. I love Cordani and I love this shoe. Very stable and gives good height to my 5'5" frame. Not a cushy bottom at all, but still very comfortable and very high quality. The relatively high price tag pays off in a well-made shoe and a brand that can be trusted. I love this kicky style and continue to love Cordani for providing stylish, supportive shoes that are particularly good for foot conditions, in my case a bone spur that I had removed. I need support for my toe and these shoes provide them! Love it!

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
