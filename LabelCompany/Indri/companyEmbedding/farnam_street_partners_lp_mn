[Farnam Street Partners L.P. Letterhead]                                        

March 13, 2006                                                                  

Board of Directors                                                              
OI Corporation                                                                  
P.O. Box 9010                                                                   
151 Graham Road                                                                 
College Station, Texas 77842-9010                                               

Gentleman,                                                                      

As a significant shareholder of OI Corporation, we believe OI Corporation's     
board of directors has failed at capital allocation and disappointingly, given  
the Company's most recent press release, we do not believe this is likely to    
change anytime soon. Last week OI Corporation filed an 8-K indicating three of  
the five board members would be retiring: one by December 31, 2006; one by May, 
2007; and one by the 2008 annual meeting. At this point the majority of the     
board members have announced retirement from the board but still serve as board 
members. We believe the retiring board members should be replaced as soon as    
possible.                                                                       

We believe board members who have significant ownership positions in the company
are the best board members for shareholders. To quote Warren Buffett from his   
2002 letter to shareholders: "To find new directors, we will look through our   
shareholders list for people who directly, or in their family, have had large   
Berkshire holdings -- in the millions of dollars -- for a long time. Individuals
making that cut should automatically meet two of our tests, namely that they be 
interested in Berkshire and shareholder-oriented."                              

Farnam Street Partners is the second largest shareholder OI Corporation. Our    
initial 13-D filing on December 9, 2002 expressed our opinion that the board of 
directors' should authorize and implement a share repurchase program to address 
the Company's overcapitalized balance sheet and create shareholder value.       

During the period 2002 through nine months of 2005 OI Corporation generated $9.2
million from operating activities. During this period the Company did not pay   
out any dividends or make any significant acquisitions and only made a minimal  
share repurchase of $143,105 in 2003. It did make one investment of $1,000,000  
in Intelligent Ion, Inc which was subsequently acquired and written down by     
$767,000.                                                                       

OI Corporation's September 30, 2005 balance sheet states cash and current       
investments totaled $11.4 million or approximately 36% of the market value of OI
Corporation at that time.                                                       

Farnam Street Partners invests in companies that generate strong cash flows and 
OI Corporation accomplishes this. Ultimately, however companies have to reinvest
the cash flows or return them to the shareholders. OI Corporation has failed at 
this during the 2002 through September, 2005 period.                            

Last week we were disappointed to learn the majority of the board, the          
individuals making the capital allocation decisions for the shareholders, have  
announced their retirements although they will continue charting the strategic  
course of OI Corporation. We believe this sends a clear message that the Board  
is and will be in a state of future discontinuity given the stated retirement   
schedules of three out of its five members. The outcome of this discontinuity   
will most likely mean that the use of the disproportionate cash position held by
the company won't and cannot be prudently agreed upon until the new Board is    
assembled. We believe the new board should be put in place as soon as possible. 

We believe shareholders of OI Corporation will be better served by board members
that have a significant ownership stake and have nominated Ray Cabillot and     
Peter Haeg to the board. Farnam Street Partners currently owns 252,880 shares or
8.9% of OI Corporation.                                                         

Sincerely,                                                                      

Farnam Street Partners                                                          

Ray Cabillot                        Peter Haeg

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
