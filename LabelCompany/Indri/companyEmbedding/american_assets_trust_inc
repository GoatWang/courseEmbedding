CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY










				Environmental Sustainability


				Social Responsibility










		American Assets Trust, Inc. is a dedicated steward of our community and our environment. Together with our community partners, we have developed and incorporated into our business practices innovative programs to promote environmental sustainability and social responsibility.


 

 




		Environmental Sustainability


			Protecting the earth’s natural resources is a top priority for American Assets Trust, Inc. In operating and developing our properties, we use proven conservation methods to reduce carbon emissions, repair environmental damage, and preserve natural resources for this and future generations. We have implemented internal sustainability guidelines developed by experts in the ﬁeld of sustainability.

			In addition to implementing environmentally friendly changes, in conjunction with Pacific Gas & Electric and Silicon Valley Environment Committee, members of our team presented Energy Conservation Programs and Water Conservation Programs, respectively, to other companies in the commercial real estate community and committee members.  Using the knowledge we have gained through the years in operating and developing our properties, we presented adopted systems and processes that are viable for commercial real estate.  We hope that in sharing our knowledge, our neighbors will adopt changes that have an overall positive impact on the environment.

			Below are just some of our specific accomplishments aimed toward sustainability:



					Portfolio Wide



							Portfolio-wide LED retrofitting project at many of our office and retail properties.   The high-efficiency and extended-lifespan LED lights are controlled using smart control systems, including Building Automation System and telematics controls.  The controls automatically adjust the lighting needs according to natural sunrise and sunset schedules instead of manual timers.



							Installation of electric vehicle charging stations at many of our properties with additional units slated to be installed.



							Installation of ultra-water efficient fixtures and appliances.



							Adaptive and environmentally sensitive landscaping, including drought-tolerant plants.



							E-Waste programs, including annual free Earth Day E-Waste drive for tenants and employees.





					First & Main – LEED Platinum Certified, the highest LEED certification rating.






						City Center Bellevue



								LEED Gold-EBOM Certified.



								Implemented a construction waste diversion program.  Construction waste as a result of tenant improvement projects must be recycled or diverted, to the extent possible, away from the landfill.



								Installed rain water collection tank for exterior landscaping.







						Landmark – The 5th building in San Francisco to implement the Waste-to-Energy program.  The Waste-to-Energy program processes dirty HVAC filters by diverting them away from the landfill and transferring them to an off-site combustion chamber facility.  The filters are then burned at high temperatures resulting in a residual product of less than 10% of its original volume.  The heat generated from the combustion chambers heats water in steel tubes that form the walls of the combustion chamber to create steam.  The steam powers the turbine that continuously generates electricity which, in turn, is fed back into the grid.  For every 2,000 lbs. of waste, 520 kWh of electricity is generated, powering homes and businesses in Northern California. 





						Embassy Suites at Waikiki Beach Walk – Variable Frequency Drive Motor HVAC system.





						Lloyd District Portfolio:



								Easy access to multiple public transportation rails.  Including on-site terminals for the Portland Streetcar and the Max Light Rail System with a direct route to Portland International Airport and other destinations throughout Portland.  The Lloyd properties are also situated at the main city access for bicycles commuting from North and East Portland.



								Hassalo on Eighth



										On track for LEED Platinum Certification for Homes and New Development upon completion of the project



										Nation’s largest and first multi-family National Organic Recycling Machine (or NORM) treating 100% of the grey and black water created by each of the three residential buildings, and the Lloyd 700 Office building, amounting to approximately 47,000 gallons of wastewater diverted from the municipal sewer system daily.  NORM doesn't generate any waste of its own: bio-solids are used for fertilizer off-site, and fats, oils and greases are used for fuel off-site as well.  NORM is expected to reduce water usage for the four buildings by 50%, or approximately 7,300,000 gallons, of water per year.



										Eco-Roofs to assist in storm water mitigation.



										Bike Hub with over 1,000 bike stalls, plus lockers and shower facilities.



										Food composting program for residence and office tenants.









						California Portfolio



								Transitioning from traditional irrigation systems to eco-friendly reclaimed irrigation systems to maintain our award winning landscaping while reducing water consumption.  Properties where established municipal lines collect and treat gray water will use the reclaimed water to irrigate our landscaping, resulting in a reduction of our fresh potable water needs.



								Implemented one of the largest and most comprehensive recycling programs in San Diego for our entire Southern California portfolio.  Our Northern California property, Del Monte Center, implemented a comprehensive glass bottles, cans and cardboard boxes recycling program.







						Torrey Reserve Campus:



								Variable Frequency Drives on all Cooling Tower HVAC systems.



								Storm Water Pollution Prevention Program.



								GENEA – HVAC control system with an on-demand use option.   This eliminates the necessity of cooling empty buildings.



								Energy Star Certified.



								Parking canopy and rooftop photovoltaic systems (solar energy) generating up to 500 kWh, reducing the overall electrical consumption needs of the campus.



								Phase III and IV of the development recycled an estimated 75% of the construction waste or approximately 90,000 SF of waste.





				In addition, sustainability is a major focus of our active development project:


			Torrey Point Development: The Torrey Point development, formerly known as Sorrento Pointe, has finally commenced after 17 years of entitlement efforts!    The project is situated in one of San Diego’s premier locations with panoramic views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach and Reserve and the Pacific Ocean.  With that, our design team incorporated green elements to blend with the surrounding habitat and wetlands, all the while taking advantage of the breathtaking views.   We are committed to obtaining U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the buildings, including the addition of electric vehicle charging stations. 

			We are proud of our accomplishments thus far and will continue our efforts to develop and retrofit sustainable properties.

American Assets Trust, Inc. Announces Issuance of $100 Million of 3.78% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series F, Due July 19, 2024
BY GlobeNewswire— 4:15 PM ET 07/19/2017


SAN DIEGO, July  19, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Assets Trust, Inc. (AAT) (the “Company”) and American Assets Trust, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) announced today the closing of a privately placed debt offering of $100,000,000 of seven-year senior guaranteed notes (the “Series F Notes”) by the Operating Partnership.  The Series F Notes are unsecured, will pay a fixed interest rate of 3.78% and are due on July 19, 2024.
Prior to closing, the Operating Partnership entered into a treasury lock contract to reduce the interest rate variability exposure of the projected interest cash outflows under the then-prospective private placement of the Series F Notes described above.  As a result, net of the settlement of the treasury lock contract, the fixed interest rate in accordance with GAAP for the Series F Notes is approximately 3.85% per annum, through maturity. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the private placement of the Series F Notes to repay outstanding amounts on its credit facility and for other general corporate purposes. About American Assets Trust (AAT), Inc.                                                    American Assets Trust, Inc. (AAT) is a full service, vertically integrated and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, headquartered in San Diego, California.  The Company has over 50 years of acquiring, improving, developing and managing premier retail, office and residential properties throughout the United States in some of the nation’s most dynamic, high-barrier-to-entry markets primarily in Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. The Company's retail portfolio comprises approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet, and its office portfolio comprises approximately 2.7 million square feet.  In addition, the Company owns one mixed-use property (including approximately 97,000 rentable square feet of retail space and a 369-room all-suite hotel) and over 2,112 multifamily units.  In 2011, the Company was formed to succeed to the real estate business of American Assets, Inc., a privately held corporation founded in 1967 and, as such, has significant experience, long-standing relationships and extensive knowledge of its core markets, submarkets and asset classes.  For additional information, please visit www.americanassetstrust.com. Forward Looking Statements    This press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does American Assets Inc carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
American Assets Inc currently holds license 961121, 736845 (General Building Contractor), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring American Assets Inc



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring American Assets Inc



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
American Assets Inc has a $15,000 bond with International Fidelity Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring American Assets Inc



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
