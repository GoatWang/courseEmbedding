Culture of Service
We seek to distinguish our firm through a culture of superior
				    personal service. Gould clients quickly come to appreciate the courtesy,
				    responsiveness and attention they receive from Gould staff. We exist
				    to serve our clients, and make every effort to do so with a genuine personal
			    touch.
Whether it’s orchestrating an IRA rollover from a former employer, working
				  with a client’s CPA at tax time, or navigating an intricate estate planning
				  matter, Gould is there when clients need help managing their financial
				  lives. 
At a fundamental level, service is about attitude. We strive to display
			    a can-do attitude at all times.
