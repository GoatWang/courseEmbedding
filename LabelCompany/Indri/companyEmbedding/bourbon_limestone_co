    WORLD’S HIGHEST RATED BOURBON.


                        Elegant. Smooth. Refined. That’s what extra aging will do to bourbon. And now Jim Beam Black® is officially the #1 rated bourbon in the world after winning the Bourbon Trophy, the highest awarded accolade in the bourbon category at the 2016 International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC).

What do you love about Jim Beam?













    Extra-aged to perfection.

Our premium 86-proof, extra-aged bourbon ages years longer in white oak barrels than original Jim Beam®. It’s those extra years of aging that give Jim Beam Black® its full-bodied flavor with smooth caramel and warm oak notes.

Is Kentucky Limestone Water Indispensible for Bourbon?















Is Kentucky Limestone Water Indispensible for Bourbon?

Food and Dining
November 27, 2013


Water is an essential ingredient in bourbon. And many local distillers have long said the commonwealth’s unique limestone water distinguishes Kentucky bourbon from competitors. But how important is it really?
To legally be called bourbon, the spirit has to be made of mostly corn. It has to be aged in new charred-oak barrels. And it has to be made in the United States. There’s no rule that dictates what type of water is used, but many local distillers say no matter what the law says, bourbon isn’t bourbon unless it’s made with limestone water.
It’s a stipulation that goes back to the early days of bourbon. University of Kentucky geology professor Alan Fryar says it was easy access to limestone water that played an integral role in launching the bourbon industry here centuries ago.
“I found intimately connected with the emergence of bourbon-making in this part of the country that limestone water was what we had in the late 1700s when people started making bourbon in this area,” he says.
The allegiance to limestone water isn’t just superstition. It has a high pH, which promotes fermentation. The limestone adds minerals, like calcium. It filters out impurities, most importantly iron, which gives liquor a bad taste.
Kentucky’s limestone water was perfect for those early distillers who developed bourbon, and it explains why the industry is centered here. But is it still a necessity for modern distillers?
At the Maker’s Mark Distillery in Loretto, there’s a spring of limestone water running through the property. It once turned the distillery’s grist mill and provided the water for bourbon.
Today, Maker’s Mark draws its water from a lake on its bucolic Marion County campus. It’s part of the brand’s ties to its home. As Master Distiller Greg Davis begins telling me about all of the company’s wildlife management practices on the property, a large buck appears on the hill, almost like it’s staged.
“Oh, he’s just giving us the flag,” Davis whispers, pointing to the buck’s white tail. “He kind of came back this way. He’s right at the roof tip of that warehouse.”
Maker’s Mark owns nearly 700 acres around the lake, in an effort to protect the water from agricultural runoff. They actively manage the wildlife habitat around the lake—and Davis says the company is committed to maintaining the water’s integrity.
“You know, it’s not about taking raw water and then trying to treat it or trying to do something with it,” he says. “That’s what Mother Nature is for. And she’s already filtering it and doing all the work through the limestone for us, let’s help her by helping what we have here.”
But other distillers don’t have access to a perfect water source, or they produce too much bourbon to rely on a lake or spring.
Louisville-made Old Forester uses city water to make its bourbon. Brown-Forman master distiller Chris Morris says the company used to use alluvial limestone water that ran beneath the city, but it’s been contaminated for years. Now, the water from the Louisville Water Company is treated with a process called reverse osmosis before it ends up in a bottle of Old Forester.
Morris says for his bourbon, limestone water isn’t necessary.
“Well limestone water is wonderful to have if you can use it, if you have it,” he says. “But it is not essential.”
Gable Erenzo agrees. He’s a distiller at Tuthilltown Spirits, which makes liquor—including bourbon—in New York’s Hudson River Valley. There’s actually some limestone in that region, too. But Erenzo says the water is only one small part of a bourbon’s flavor profile. Think of the concept of terroir, often used with wine: this idea that geography, geology and climate all come together to create a unique product.
“So I think the three main things that will create a specific regional flavor profile for whiskey or for bourbon in general would be the water, the grain and the yeast,” Erenzo says.
And bourbon brands have adjusted to create their own special flavors—whether that’s dependent on limestone water or not.
Alan Fryar of UK says even if special Kentucky water isn’t exactly essential to bourbon production anymore, the myth adds to the overall effect.
“I think that’s where the concept of terroir comes in, where it’s not just physical factors, but it’s also what the consumer perceives as the place, the origin of the spirit that gives it value,” he says.
“So it’s branding?” I ask.
“Yeah, basically.”
Greg Davis of Maker’s Mark says for his company, using limestone water is about more than branding—it’s a key ingredient. But that doesn’t mean other distillers don’t successfully create bourbon by placing less emphasis on the water.
“It’s just not going to be steeped in the history of what is traditional bourbon,” he says.

Timeline - Limestone Branch Distillery





































 













Select Page


  
 
 











 
 
 
 
 
 



The ancestors of brothers Steve and Paul Beam were distillers for five generations before Prohibition interrupted.
 
 
 


			Steve Beam
		 
 

“I always felt like it was an unfinished chapter for my family,” says Steve, of the 200 years of family story that preceded him.
So he and brother Paul reopened the book, and started making history again…with Limestone Branch Distillery.
Using recipes – some of them plucked from their grandfather Guy’s notebook – and family knowledge gleaned from the previous generations of master distillers that came before them, Steve and Paul now distill their own first-class products.
And always, clues about who they are and where they came from are buried in the names and tastes of their products. And they are where they are – near Lebanon, KY – for a reason.

A legend is born. Their story begins. Born in 1770, Jacob Beam was a farmer who began producing whiskey in the style that became known as bourbon. Jacob Beam sold his first barrels of corn whiskey around 1795. His whiskey was called Old Jake Beam, and the distillery was located not too far from where Limestone Branch is located today.
		 
 
 
 



Their T. J. Pottinger moonshine is named for Thomas Jefferson “Jeff” Pottinger, the grandson of Captain Samuel Pottinger Sr., who established the first pioneer outpost in 1781 in nearby southern Nelson County.
The small fort was called Pottinger’s Station, and Captain Sam built his home not far from Pottinger Station and called it Walnut Hill, where family lore says Captain Sam had a frontier distillery atop a nearby cave, says Steve.
The early Kentucky Pottinger family flourished, and it was T. J. who moved the Pottinger distillery operations to nearby Gethsemane Station, primarily to get closer to the Louisville & Nashville Railroad tracks for shipping purposes.
T. J. operated at Gethsemane as T. J. Pottinger and Company. In 1872 it was being operated by Francis Head and Orene Parker.
 
 

			Early 1900’s – M.C. Beam and Company
		 
 
 
 



1900 – Minor Case Beam becomes sole proprietor of the distillery
In 1883, Minor Case (M.C.) Beam, Steve and Paul’s great-grandfather, bought Parker out, and the distillery operated as Head and Beam. Seventeen years later in 1900, Francis Head sold his interests to Minor Case Beam and the distillery name was changed to M.C. Beam and Company. It produced the T. J. Pottinger and Old Trump brands.

So that’s why Limestone Branch Distillery’s moonshine bears the “T. J. Pottinger” wording, and Limestone Branch Distillery’s “Revenge” is made in the memory of Steve and Paul’s great-grandfather, Minor Case, known as M. C.
 
 
 


			1934 – First barrel Fairfield Distillery, Guy Beam Master Distiller
		 
 

M. C. Beam (1857-1934) brought his son Guy S. Beam – Steve and Paul’s grandfather – into the business and trained him well.
Thus begins begins the 5th Generation of family distillers.
Guy Beam became a well-known master distiller and worked at several distilleries, including Old Trump, Yellowstone, Frankfort Distillery, Fairfield Distillery, and Schenely. But Prohibition had made a legal distilling living impossible – Guy went to Canada and distilled there for the Wathen family during the Prohibition years.
For Steve and Paul, even their father Jimmy, the son of Guy, kept colorful ties to the distilling business. Jimmy, known for his baseball talents, played in the then-well-known Bourbon League as well as worked for the Loretto and Athertonville distilleries.
		 
 
 
 



Over on their mother’s side, Steve and Paul are descendants of John Baptiste Dant and his son, Joseph Washington (J.W.) Dant.
 
 
 
 



1836-1902 Joseph Washington Dant begins distilling in a hollowed out log
 
 
 
 



John Baptiste Dant had arrived in frontier Kentucky and had settled at Pottinger Station, old Sam’s frontier fort. By 1836, his son Joseph Washington Dant, Steve and Paul’s great-great grandfather on their mother’s side, had his own distillery in Marion County, KY. As the distillery prospered it, operations we taken over by J.W.’s son W.W. Dant.
J. W. Dant had located early operations in Dant’s Station because of the construction of the L & N tracks. Steve and Paul’s mother Dottie, descended from the J. W. Dant lineage, worked in the family distillery during high school. 
But remember…Prohibition, in essence, disrupted everything.

Jimmy and Toddy Beam Play in Old Bourbon League for Athertonville Distillery


 






				In 2010, I made the commitment to do it, put my side of the family back in the distilling business. It was something I always wanted to do. I began researching and apprenticing, and formed Limestone Branch Distillers, Inc. in October 2010.
				Steve Beam
Limestone Branch Distillery
 
 
 
 
 



Paul, who had developed a number of business opportunities in Louisville, joined in and the dream was underway, with critical financial backing from other immediate family members.
Now…the distillery was truly a family affair.
They decided Lebanon would be the perfect location because it’s just a stone’s throw away from the now-long-gone distilleries of the family’s past. And, local grain and limestone water, both so essential for the unique and personal recipes, is readily available.
The groundbreaking with a silver shovel was on May 26, 2011, and the ribbon cutting on Feb. 17, 2012. Under the guidance of their father, the brothers reconstructed a small distillery reminiscent of an era gone by. Inside is a 150-gallon hand-hammered copper potstill that’s used to produce small one-barrel batches of the finest spirits possible.
Visiting the place offers an experience as unique as the products.

White Heirloom Corn

50%


Cane Sugar

50%


 
 

Steve says it was the craft industry development in Kentucky that really made the development of Limestone Branch Distillery possible.
And up until 2014 almost all the Limestone Branch products were Sugar*Shine, a distilled spirit made from a mash of 50 percent white heirloom corn and 50 percent cane sugar. While their Bourbon matures almost all the Limestone Branch products used unaged Sugar*Shine, a distilled spirit made from a mash of 50 percent white heirloom corn and 50 percent cane sugar as their base.
		 
 
 


But in September 2014 they came onboard with their first uniquely aged product, Precinct No. 6.
 
 
 


Introducing Precinct No. 6
The Beam family’s way of romancing the expression of oak
Precinct No. 6 – that’s the old Marion County, KY geographical designation that was given to the area where many of the old family-related distilleries were located. Check the label: That’s an enhanced copy of an actual, historic Marion County map in the background.
So…even though Limestone Branch Distillery is the latest chapter in Steve and Paul’s family story, it’s part of the yet-to-be completed book about the ongoing family dynamic.
And Steve and Paul and the Limestone Branch Distillery family are now making history with new chapters to that book with each and every new day.

This is no gimmick, once you pour your favorite bourbon over a frozen ice ball of limestone water you will immediately last the clarity of the bourbon.  No iron, no fluorides, just the sweet scents of the bourbon. 
This Limestone water is drawn from the same network of ancient underground springs that percolate water through limestone rocks used in the making of bourbon. This natural process creates a velvety-smooth taste with absolutely no iron which reactions with bourbon mash. This item is offered in a package of four (4) One Liter plastic bottles. (33 ounces per bottle).  This limestone water package is a perfect gift for a bourbon lover, gift for a whiskey lover, or simply a great home bar accessory.

For the true Bourbon Lover. Ever hear of "Bourbon & Branch", well here is the "Branch" that perfectly compliments the Bourbon. Kentucky's Limestone filtered spring water brings out the flavor nuances of your favorite bourbon with the perfect bourbon mixing water. Unlike tap water or other bottled waters, limestone water brings out the flavor profile of a bourbon rather than altering the profile as most waters do. This is no gimmick, once you pour your favorite bourbon over a frozen ice ball of limestone water you will immediately last the clarity of the bourbon.  No iron, no fluorides, just the sweet scents of the bourbon. 
This Limestone water is drawn from the same network of ancient underground springs that percolate water through limestone rocks used in the making of bourbon. This natural process creates a velvety-smooth taste with absolutely no iron which reactions with bourbon mash. This item is offered in a package of four (4) One Liter plastic bottles. (33 ounces per bottle).  This limestone water package is a perfect gift for a bourbon lover, gift for a whiskey lover, or simply a great home bar accessory. 
Purchase a Whiskey Ball or Large Cube Tray and freeze the limestone water for an amazing whiskey drinking experience. 

Sold in Packages of (4) One Litre Plastic Limestone Mixing Water.

Handcrafted in Kentucky

Bourbon vs. Whiskey









































    WORLD’S HIGHEST RATED BOURBON.


                        Elegant. Smooth. Refined. That’s what extra aging will do to bourbon. And now Jim Beam Black® is officially the #1 rated bourbon in the world after winning the Bourbon Trophy, the highest awarded accolade in the bourbon category at the 2016 International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC).

    Reviews







What do you love about Jim Beam?













    Extra-aged to perfection.

Our premium 86-proof, extra-aged bourbon ages years longer in white oak barrels than original Jim Beam®. It’s those extra years of aging that give Jim Beam Black® its full-bodied flavor with smooth caramel and warm oak notes.

    Refreshingly Crisp.


                        Premium bourbon meets the juicy refreshment of apple in Jim Beam® Apple. Enjoy straight, on the rocks or with club soda and a lemon wedge.

What do you love about Jim Beam?













    For those who like it smooth.

Surprisingly smooth and deliciously different. Juicy but not overpowering, it retains a rich bourbon core. Perfect for whiskey fans, it’s sure to tempt those looking for a cocktail that’s refreshing and new.
