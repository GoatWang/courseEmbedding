Angela Bontempo Announces Intent to Retire

Monday, December 3, 2012


C. Angela Bontempo, president and CEO of Saint Vincent Health System, has officially announced her intent to retire, effective December 31, 2010.  Her retirement was formally accepted at the Saint Vincent Board of Trustees meeting on Tuesday, November 30.   
The announcement came as no surprise to the Sisters of St. Joseph or the Saint Vincent Board of Trustees, as Bontempo had indicated in early 2009 she intended to retire by the end of 2010.  At that time, the board initiated its succession planning process.    
According to Tim Shuttleworth, chairman of the Health System Board of Trustees, the board has been engaged for nearly two years in a search and recruitment process to find the right person to succeed Bontempo within her timeframe.   
"When Angela accepted the position at Saint Vincent in 2001, she was very clear.  She would bring to Erie her absolute best -- including vast and varied experiences in Catholic healthcare -- for about 10 years.  And after that, she would be looking forward to retirement," said Shuttleworth.   
When recruited in 2001, Bontempo became the first lay person to serve as president and CEO of Saint Vincent -- Erie's first hospital and one of western Pennsylvania's only remaining Catholic hospitals.    "Angela was the right person at the right time.  Her experience as a Daughter of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul and her success as a healthcare administrator across the country made her the right fit for a Catholic health system in transition," Shuttleworth explained.  “Angela has led this Health System in an extraordinary way during what could be considered 'the most challenging of times -- economically and for the healthcare industry overall.  There's no doubt that Saint Vincent and the region have benefited from her vast experience."   
During her nine years as president and CEO, Saint Vincent expanded facilities and services, including the opening of the Sister Margaret Ann Hardner Building, expansion and renovation of the NICU and Women’s Center.  She also guided the opening of the Saint Vincent Imaging Center, Endoscopy Center, Urgent Care West and Children's Healthcare West -- all at Yorktown Centre -- and the start of another expansion project on the Saint Vincent campus that will enhance surgical and emergency services as well as provide state-of-the-art energy for the hospital.    
Under her watch, Saint Vincent also saw extraordinary growth of its medical staff, with the recruitment of more than 340 physicians in multiple specialties committed to serving Erie and the surrounding region.  Bontempo also stepped in as CEO of Westfield Memorial Hospital during a three-year battle with the state of New York to keep the hospital open.   Among other accomplishments, she made quality initiatives a top priority and established the first senior administrative position overseeing quality and medical informatics.  As a result, Saint Vincent has been recognized locally, regionally and nationally for quality and service by organizations such as: 
HealthGrades - rated #1 in the state for cardiac surgery
Premier Award for Quality
AHA/McKesson Quest for Quality Award
JD Power and Associates
Solucient Top 100 Performance Improvement Leader
Thompson Reuters - Top 100 Hospitals for Performance Improvement and Cardiac Benchmark for Success
Highmark Pay for Performance Award - scoring 99% in 4 health improvement projects  
 
Bontempo's influence has also extended far beyond Saint Vincent through her leadership in professional organizations, service on boards of many community organizations and membership in Catholic healthcare organizations, including:
Pennsylvania Catholic Health Care Association Board (presently the Chair);
Hospital and Healthcare Association of Pennsylvania Board of Directors;
Diocese of Erie Finance Council;
Erie Chamber and Growth Partnership;
United Way of Erie County Board of Directors;
Vantage Board of Directors;
WNY Hospital Association Board of Directors;
Chautauqua County Health Network;
Westfield Memorial Hospital Board of Trustees; and
M&T Bank Corporation Board of Directors and Chair of Audit & Risk Committee
   
During the past decade, she was also involved with American College of Healthcare Executives (ACHE) committees on Membership and Nomination, as well as contributing to its seminars as a presenter.  
In her early tenure at Saint Vincent, Bontempo also published chapters and articles in both clinical and management journals, and served on the Governor's Committee for Medical Malpractice Liability Committee.   
"Angela was one of the best decisions the Sisters ever made for Saint Vincent.  There couldn't have been a better person to transition Saint Vincent from religious to lay leadership," said Sister Ricarda Vincent, immediate past president of the Sisters of St. Joseph.  "She not only understood, but also embraced and propelled our mission to the next level.  She stretched us.  And thanks to Angela, Saint Vincent has an enhanced discipline in governance, a senior vice president of mission integration, a clear articulation of our core values, and most important -- a solid foundation to meet future challenges -- especially those related to healthcare reform and the continuation of the Sisters' ministry," she added.  
On behalf of the Saint Vincent Board and Administration, Shuttleworth commented, "Angela will be missed, not only at Saint Vincent, but also among her colleagues in health care, the organizations and advisory groups that have benefited from her counsel, and especially in the community where she has been an articulate voice for economic development and the continued ministry of Catholic healthcare, particularly for the underserved."   
While Bontempo will officially step down as president and CEO on December 31, she will remain as counsel to the administration for three to six months.  The Saint Vincent Board of Trustees and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Northwestern Pennsylvania have selected Scott Whalen, Ph.D., to succeed Angela as President and CEO of the health system, effective Jan. 1, 2011.  Whalen currently serves as Saint Vincent Health Center's President and Chief Operating Officer.
