Disclosure of Financial Interests with Industry
Washington University and its physicians are committed to ensuring integrity and objectivity in medical decision-making. Some of our physicians work collaboratively with pharmaceutical or medical device companies to develop innovative ideas and products that can improve health care delivery and clinical outcomes for patients. In some instances, our faculty physicians are paid by these commercial companies to provide advice on product design or to speak about the use of medications, devices, equipment or procedures. These payments may include: a) compensation for consulting and speaking engagements, b) equity, and/or c) royalties for products invented by our faculty. Any payments to Washington University physicians must be based on tangible services and may not exceed fair market value for their work. In addition to disclosure on this web site, physicians earning more than $10,000 per year must disclose their corporate financial relationship in writing to patients when prescribing or using that company's products.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Meet the Attorneys and Staff
Daniel J. Brennan, Attorney
dbrennan@gadtkelawfirm.com
Dan focuses his practice on protecting the rights of consumers with  lemon automobiles, mobile homes, recreational vehicles and consumer products of  all kinds.  In addition, Dan represents  consumers who have been subjected to abusive and harassing debt collections.
 
Dan spent the first years of his career defending some of the biggest  companies in the world in product liability and warranty cases across the country.  He now uses that experience working for Minnesota consumers under the Minnesota  Lemon Law and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act—two of several consumer  protections statutes that allow consumers to enforce their warranty rights  without bearing the overwhelming cost of paying attorney fees.  In addition, Dan represents Minnesota  consumers under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and its Minnesota  counterpart. Too often, debt collectors resort to unfair, disrespectful and,  ultimately, illegal practices to collect debts from consumers – sometimes going  so far as to attempt to collect debts from those who do not owe them.  Dan steps into the gap between the abusive  collector and the consumer to ensure the consumer is treated fairly and to hold  the collector responsible for his/her conduct—all at no cost to his clients.
 
Since he started representing Minnesota consumers in 2003, Dan has  earned settlements for his clients from corporate giants like General Motors,  Ford Motor Company, Chrysler Group LLC, BMW, Toyota, Honda, Kia Motors, and  others, as well as achieving trial wins for his client from the likes of Ford,  Kia, Mercedes-Benz and BMW. In addition, he has obtained settlements arising  out of abusive collection practices on the part of collectors from around the  country.  Dan has also represented his  clients before the Minnesota Court of Appeals, Minnesota Supreme Court and the  Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
 
Dan attended college at St.  Louis University, where he achieved a 3.8 GPA and was a member of the  “Billiken” soccer team.  Dan then  transferred to and graduated from the University of Minnesota.  Dan went on to attend William Mitchell Law  School and graduated Magna Cum Laude and was a staff member of the William Mitchell Law Review.  Dan then served as a judicial clerk for the  Honorable Raymond L. Erickson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota.
 
Following his clerkship in 2000, Dan joined Bowman and Brooke LLP, a  national law firm based in Minneapolis, defending major product manufacturers  in warranty and product liability cases.   In 2002, Dan left Bowman and Brooke and joined Fredrikson & Byron  P.A., where he was a commercial litigator before starting his own law firm,  Brennan Law Office.  Since 2003, Dan’s  practice has remained committed to representing Minnesota consumers with  warranty and debt collection claims.  He  later teamed up with Todd Gadtke to form Gadtke and Brennan, P.A. in 2010.
In addition to his law practice, Dan is an avid bicyclist, sea kayaker  and cross-country skier.

Where?My current locationSearchHomeWayne, PABrennan Daniel JWayne, PA Brennan Daniel JAbout Search ResultsAbout Search ResultsYP - The Real Yellow PagesSM - helps you find the right local businesses to meet your specific needs. Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.
