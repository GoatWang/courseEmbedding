DISCLAIMER

The risk of loss in trading foreign exchange can be substantial. You should carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. You may sustain a total loss of funds and any additional funds that you deposit with your broker to maintain a position in the foreign exchange market. 
Actual past performance is no guarantee of future results. Simulated performance results also have certain limitations unlike actual performance records; simulated results do not represent composite trading. No representation can or is being made that any trading system will, or is likely, to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown in this simulated performance record.
The performance records have been calculated in a manner we believe to be reasonable and are based on the respective leverage factors intended to be used. Prospective clients must recognize that any simulation of a hypothetical record, even when based on actual trading systems, with qualified trade execution, has inherent limitations. We believe that the records as presented should be of interest to clients in determining whether to participate, such rates of return should by no means be taken as an indication of how the system will perform or would have performed, even given the same trades. Any performance record compiled from individual performance records of any trading methodologies has certain hypothetical and artificial characteristics and must be evaluated accordingly.
If you purchase or sell a foreign exchange option you may sustain a total loss of the initial margin funds and additional funds that you deposit with your broker to establish or maintain your position. If the market moves against your position, you could be called upon by your broker to deposit additional margin funds, on short notice, in order to maintain your position. If you do not provide the additional required funds within the prescribed time, your position may be liquidated at a loss, and you would be liable for any resulting deficit in your account.
Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This can occur, for example when a currency is deregulated or fixed trading bands are widened.
The placement of contingent orders by you or your trading advisor, such as a "stop-loss" or "stop-limit" orders, will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, since market conditions may make it impossible to execute such orders.
A “spread” position may not be less risky than a simple “long” or “short” position.
The high degree of leverage that is often obtainable in foreign exchange trading can work against you as well as for you. The use of leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.
In some cases, managed accounts are subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for those accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets.
Currency trading is speculative and volatile. Currency prices are highly volatile. Price movements for currencies are influenced by, among other things: changing supply-demand relationships; trade, fiscal, monetary, exchange control programs and policies of governments; United States and foreign political and economic events and policies; changes in national and international interest rates and inflation; currency devaluation; and sentiment of the market place. None of these factors can be controlled by any individual advisor and no assurance can be given that an advisor's advice will result in profitable trades for a participating client or that a client will not incur losses from such events.
Currency trading can be highly leveraged. The low margin deposits normally required in currency trading (typically between 3% - 20% of the value of the contract purchased or sold) permits extremely high degree leverage. Accordingly, a relatively small price movement in a contract may result in immediate and substantial losses to the client. Like other leveraged investments, in certain markets, any trade may result in losses in excess of the amount invested.
Currency trading presents unique risks. The interbank market consists of a direct dealing market, in which a participant trades directly with a participating bank or dealer, and a brokers' market. The brokers' market differs from the direct dealing market in that the banks or financial institutions serve as intermediaries rather than principals to the transaction. In the brokers' market, brokers may add a commission to the prices they communicate to their customers, or they may incorporate a fee into the quotation of price.
Trading in the interbank markets differs from trading in futures or futures options in a number of ways that may create additional risks. For example, there are no limitations on daily price moves in most currency markets. In addition, the principals who deal in interbank markets are not required to continue to make markets. There have been periods during which certain participants in interbank markets have refused to quote prices for interbank trades or have quoted prices with unusually wide spreads between the prices at which transactions occur.
Frequency of trading; degree of leverage used. It is impossible to predict the precise frequency with which positions will be entered and liquidated. Foreign exchange trading due to the finite duration of contracts, the high degree of leverage that is attainable in trading those contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange prices and markets, among other things, typically involves a much higher frequency of trading and turnover of positions than may be found in other types of investments.
No, I don't agree.
YES, I AGREE!
