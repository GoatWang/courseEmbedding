Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Real Estate Fund among 
232,
232,
203
and 
142
Real Estate
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Bonds make interest payments and repay the principal on a fixed schedule. Interest and principal payments are subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer.

Certificates of Deposit (CDs)


CDs offer FDIC insurance,3 providing a guarantee of the invested principal up to certain limits.






Money Market Funds

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.
Research investment grade bond funds



Municipal

Invest in bonds issued by state governments and municipalities. While they tend to offer lower yields, the income they generate is generally free from federal income taxes.* Learn more about types of municipal bond funds.
Research municipal bond funds



High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

Invest in a mix of taxable bonds, including both high yield and investment grade securities issued by the U.S. and by foreign governments, as well as domestic and foreign corporations, giving investors the ability to create a diversified fixed income portfolio through a single fund. Learn more about multisector bond funds.
Research multisector bond funds



International & global

International bond funds invest in a range of taxable bonds issued by foreign governments and corporations. Global bond funds invest in bonds from around the world, including bonds issued by U.S. government agencies and corporations. Learn more about types of international and global bond funds.

Fidelity Fund News & Analysis




Fidelity fund prices & documents



















Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.


          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.


Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.


          2.
	
	
	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Highest Yields: With high-interest rate loan products designed to finance speculative real estate investment projects, the Signature Fund commands the highest yield (8.25%) of Noble Capital’s current fund offering
Profit Participation: In addition to the highest preferred return, Investors also enjoy participation in the profits created by any leverage obtained by the Fund (8.25% plus 20% profit participation on debt arbitrage).

PROPOSED FUND REORGANIZATIONS                                                   

   The respective Board of Directors or Trustees of each of the above Funds,
other than the Funds listed under the section captioned "Proposed Fund
Acquisitions" below, has approved a proposal to reorganize (the                 
"Reorganization") each Fund into a corresponding series (each a "Successor      
Fund") of one of eight Delaware business trusts. If shareholders of a Fund      
approve the Reorganization and the conditions to the Reorganization are         
satisfied, all of the assets and liabilities of the Fund will be transferred to 
the corresponding Successor Fund and each shareholder of the Fund will receive  
shares of the corresponding Successor Fund. In connection with the              
Reorganizations, each Board has approved, subject to shareholder approval, the  
reclassification of most Funds' investment objectives from "fundamental" (i.e., 
changeable by shareholder vote only) to "nonfundamental" (i.e., changeable by   
vote of the Board), the adoption by each Fund of certain standardized investment
restrictions, and the elimination or reclassification from fundamental to       
nonfundamental of each Fund's other currently fundamental investment            
restrictions.                                                                   

     The Reorganizations and related proposals are scheduled to be voted on at a
joint special meeting of shareholders to be held on December 15, 1997 (the      
"December Shareholder Meeting"). Information detailing each proposal will be    
mailed to shareholders on or about October 27, 1997.                            

 In addition, if the respective Reorganization of Keystone International
Fund Inc. and Keystone Precious Metals Holdings, Inc. is approved, effective    
January 9, 1998, the following name changes will occur:

PROPOSED FUND ACQUISITIONS 

   The respective Board of Trustees of each Fund listed below has approved a
proposal to combine all of the assets of the Selling Fund and the Acquiring Fund
into a series (each a "Successor Fund") of one of eight Delaware business       
trusts, with each Successor Fund to have substantially the same investment      
objective and policies as the Acquiring Fund. If approved, all of the assets of 
each of the Acquiring Fund and the Selling Fund would be sold to the Successor  
Fund in exchange for shares of the Successor Fund and the assumption by the     
Successor Fund of certain identified liabilities. If the proposal is approved,  
shares of the Successor Fund would be distributed to shareholders of each of the
Acquiring Fund and the Selling Fund in liquidation and subsequent termination of
the Acquiring Fund and the Selling Fund. The Boards have scheduled the proposal 
to be voted on at a joint special meeting of shareholders to be held on January
6, 1998. Each of the Acquiring Funds and the Selling Funds will mail information
detailing the proposal to its respective shareholders on or about November 14,
1997.

    The respective Board of Trustees of each of the above Funds has approved a
proposal to amend each Fund's investment objective, subject to shareholder      
approval. Each Fund will amend its investment objective to permit the Fund to   
invest without limitation in obligations subject to the federal alternative     
minimum tax. If shareholders approve the proposed change at the December        
Shareholder Meeting, under normal circumstances it is anticipated that each Fund
will invest its assets so that at least 80% of its annual interest income is    
exempt from federal income tax other than the federal alternative minimum tax.  

   If the proposed amendment to a Fund's fundamental investment objective is
approved, effective January 9, 1998, the following name changes will occur:     

                                                                [Download Table]

EVERGREEN LATIN AMERICA FUND                                                    

The Board of Trustees of Evergreen Latin America Fund has approved a  
proposal to amend the Fund's investment objective to permit the Fund to invest  
without limit in securities of issuers located in Latin America. If the change  
in investment objective is approved, the Fund would no longer be required to    
invest a percentage of its assets in securities of issuers located in the United
States and Canada. In addition, the Board has approved a proposal to amend the  
Fund's investment restriction relating to industry concentration to require that
the Fund invest at least 25% of its assets in issuers in the banking,           
construction, energy, food and beverage, retail, telecommunications and utility 
industries, and in conglomerates. Each proposal is scheduled to be voted on at  
the December Shareholder Meeting.

    PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION. The third sentence of the third paragraph under the
caption "Investment Objectives and Policies-Evergreen Income and Growth Fund" is
hereby amended to read as follows: Ordinarily, the Fund anticipates that        
approximately 75% of its portfolio will consist of equity securities (including 
convertible preferred stock) and the other 25% of debt securities (including    
convertible debt securities).                                                   

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. To the extent the Fund may invest in   
non-U.S. dollar denominated securities, it may enter into foreign currency      
transactions to obtain the necessary currencies to settle securities            
transactions. Currency transactions may be conducted either on a spot or cash   
basis at prevailing rates or through forward foreign currency exchange contracts
("forward contracts"). The Fund may also enter into forward contracts to protect
the Fund's assets denominated in a foreign currency against adverse changes in  
foreign currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations. Such changes   
could unfavorably affect the value of the Fund's assets which are denominated in
foreign currencies, such as foreign securities or funds deposited in foreign    
banks, as measured in U.S. dollars. The use of forward contracts for hedging    
purposes may limit any potential gain that might result from a relative increase
in the value of such currencies and might, in certain cases, result in losses to
the Fund. A forward contract is an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a
particular currency at a specific price and on a future date agreed upon by the 
parties. Generally, no commission charges or deposits are involved. At the time 
the Fund enters into a forward contract, Fund assets with a value equal to the  
Fund's obligations under the forward contract are segregated and are maintained 
until the contract has been settled. The Fund will not enter into a forward     
contract

P-->4974th�"Page"�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�4th
with a term of more than one year. In addition to forward contracts entered into
for hedging purposes, the Fund will generally enter into a forward contract to  
provide the proper currency to settle a securities transaction at the time the  
transaction occurs ("trade date"). The period between trade date and settlement 
date will vary between 24 hours and 60 days, depending upon local custom.       

 INVESTMENT IN SMALL COMPANIES. The Fund may invest from time to time in
securities of little-known, relatively small and special situation companies.   
Investments in such companies may tend to be speculative and volatile. A lack of
management depth in such companies could increase the risks associated with the 
loss of key personnel. Also, the material and financial resources of such       
companies may be limited, with the consequence that funds or external financing 
necessary for growth may be unavailable. Such companies may also be involved in 
the development or marketing of new products or services for which there are no 
established markets. If projected markets do not materialize or only regional   
markets develop, such companies may be adversely affected or be subject to the  
consequences of local events. Moreover, such companies may be an insignificant  
factor in their industries and may become subject to intense competition from   
larger companies. Securities of small and special situation companies in which  
the Fund invests will frequently be traded only in the over-the-counter market  
or on regional stock exchanges and will often be closely held. Securities of    
this type may have limited liquidity and be subject to wide price fluctuations. 
As a result of the risk factors described above, the net asset value of each    
Fund's shares can be expected to vary significantly.

     Each Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in bonds that, at the date
of investment, are rated within the four highest categories by Standard and     
Poor's Rating Group ("S&P") (AAA, AA, A and BBB), by Moody's Investor Service   
("Moody's") (Aaa, Aa, A and Baa), by Fitch Investors Services, LP ("Fitch")     
(AAA, AA, A and BBB) or, if not rated or rated under a different system, are of 
comparable quality to obligations so rated as determined by another nationally  
recognized statistical ratings organization (an "SRO") or by the Fund's         
investment adviser. A Fund may invest the remaining 20% of its assets in lower  
rated bonds, but it will not invest in bonds rated below B. Subject to certain  
exceptions for money market funds, a Fund is not required to sell or otherwise  
dispose of any security that loses its rating or has its rating reduced after   
the Fund has purchased it.                                                      

   The Funds are permitted to make taxable investments, and may from time to
time generate income subject to federal regular income tax.                     

EVERGREEN SMALL CAP EQUITY INCOME FUND                                          

     Under normal conditions, the Fund will invest at least 65% of its assets in
equity securities (including convertible debt securities) of companies that, at 
the time of purchase, have "total market capitalization" -- present market value
per share multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding -- of less than  
$1 billion. The Fund may invest up to 35% of its total assets in equity         
securities of companies that at the time of purchase have a total market        
capitalization of $1 billion or more, and in excess of that percentage during   
temporary defensive periods.                                                    

EVERGREEN SHORT-INTERMEDIATE BOND FUND                                          

    The Fund will invest at least 65% of its assets in bonds that, at the date
of investment, are rated within the four highest categories by S&P (AAA, AA, A  
and BBB), by Moody's (Aaa, Aa, A and Baa), by Fitch (AAA, AA, A and BBB) or, if 
not rated under a different system, are of comparable quality to obligations so 
rated as determined by another nationally recognized statistical ratings        
organization or by the Fund's investment adviser. The Fund may invest the       
remaining 35% of its assets in lower rated bonds, but it will not invest in     
bonds rated below B. The Fund is not required to sell or otherwise dispose of   
any security that loses its rating or has its rating reduced after the Fund has 
purchased it.                                                                   

 The Fund may invest in foreign securities, securities denominated in or
indexed to foreign currencies, and foreign currencies.                          

  The Fund may acquire privately placed securities that are not registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 but that can be offered and sold to qualified  
institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Act ("144A Securities"). The     
Fund's Trustees have adopted guidelines that delegate to the Fund's investment  
adviser the daily function of determining and monitoring the                    

4 

P-->497Last�"Page"�of�5TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�5th
liquidity of 144A Securities. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its net assets in
illiquid securities, which includes securities issued in private placements     
(other than 144A Securities determined to be liquid under the foregoing Rule    
144A Securities procedures and commercial paper issued under Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933).                                                        

The Fund may enter into dollar rolls in which the Fund sells income   
securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts to    
repurchase substantially similar (same type, coupon and maturity) securities on 
a specified future date. During the roll period, the Fund foregoes principal and
interest paid on such securities. The Fund is compensated by the difference     
between the current sales price and forward price for the future purchase (often
referred to as the "drop") as well as by the interest earned on the cash        
proceeds of the initial sale. Dollar rolls are treated by the Fund in the same  
manner as reverse repurchase agreements for leverage purposes.                  

KEYSTONE BALANCED FUND (K-1)                                                    

The Fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in below-investment grade 
securities issued by United States and foreign issuers having a rating range of 
BB to CCC by S&P or Fitch and/or Ba to Caa by Moody's or, if unrated or rated   
under a different system, believed by the Fund's investment adviser to be of    
comparable quality.                                                             

  Securities rated BB or lower by S&P or Fitch, or Ba or lower by Moody's,
are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the ability of the     
issuer to meet principal and interest payments. For more information on         
below-investment grade securities, see the statement of additional information. 

KEYSTONE CAPITAL PRESERVATION AND INCOME FUND                                   

The Fund may invest in (i) securities rated AAA by S&P, Moody's and/or
Fitch or, if not rated or rated under a different system, believed by the Fund's
investment adviser to be of comparable quality, and (ii) high grade commercial  
paper of United States or foreign issuers. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its 
assets in the foregoing investments.                                            

KEYSTONE DIVERSIFIED BOND FUND                                                  
KEYSTONE INTERMEDIATE TERM BOND FUND                                            
KEYSTONE HIGH INCOME BOND FUND (B-4)                                            

Each Fund may invest up to 50% of its assets in securities that are   
principally traded in securities markets located outside the United States.     

KEYSTONE INTERNATIONAL FUND INC.                                                

The Fund may enter into cross hedging transactions. A cross hedge is  
accomplished by entering into a forward contract or other arrangement with      
respect to one foreign currency for the purpose of hedging against a possible   
decline in the value of another foreign currency in which certain of the Fund's 
portfolio investments are denominated. The Fund's investment adviser may enter  
into a cross hedge, rather than hedge directly, in instances where (i) the rates
for forward contracts, options, futures contracts or options on futures         
contracts relating to the currency in which the cross hedge is effected are more
favorable than rated for similar instruments denominated in the currency that is
to be hedged and (ii) there is a high degree of correlation between the two     
currencies with respect to their movement against the U.S. dollar. Cross hedging
may be effected using the various hedging instruments described below. A cross  
hedge cannot protect against exchange rate risks perfectly, and if the Fund's   
investment adviser is incorrect in its judgment of future exchange rate         
relationships, the Fund could be in a less advantageous position than if such a 
hedge had not been established.                                                 

KEYSTONE PENNSYLVANIA TAX FREE FUND                                             

    The Fund offers Class Y shares which are available only to (i) persons who
at or prior to December 31, 1994, owned shares in a mutual fund advised by      
Evergreen Asset Management Corp., (ii) certain institutional investors, and     
(iii) investment advisory clients of First Union National Bank or its           
affiliates.                                                                     

EVERGREEN INTERMEDIATE TERM GOVERNMENT SECURITIES FUND                          
EVERGREEN SHORT-INTERMEDIATE BOND FUND                                          

Effective October 1, 1997, the Funds will declare dividends of net    
investment income daily and pay such dividends monthly.                         

September 18, 1997

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 05/31/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Real Estate Fund among 
232,
232,
203
and 
142
Real Estate
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

														In a study conducted by Corporate Insight, our bond pricing beat markup-based brokers by an average of $13 per trade online. That could add up to a cost savings of hundreds of dollars on a typical bond order.2

Individual Bonds


Bonds make interest payments and repay the principal on a fixed schedule. Interest and principal payments are subject to the creditworthiness of the issuer.






Bond Funds

Fixed Income ETFs


Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are baskets of investments that trade as a single unit throughout the day.












Certificates of Deposit (CDs)


CDs offer FDIC insurance,3 providing a guarantee of the invested principal up to certain limits.






Money Market Funds


Money market funds are managed to help preserve your principal by investing in lower-risk debt securities with shorter maturities.

1. Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.


2. Fidelity commissioned Corporate Insight to study bond pricing, available online, for self-directed retail investors from five brokers that offer corporate and municipal bonds. The study compared online bond prices for over 20,000 municipal and corporate inventory matches between September 2nd and October 6th, 2015. It compared municipal and corporate inventories offered online in quantities of at least $10,000 face or par value. The study found on average that three competitors that bundled their markups or fees into their online bond prices were asking an average of $13.97 more per bond. Corporate Insight determined the average cost differential by calculating the difference between the costs of matching corporate and municipal bond inventory at Fidelity vs. these markup-based firms in the study, then averaging the differences across all of the competitor firms. Hypothetical cost savings of $286 is based on an average size order of $22,000 face or par value bonds and average cost differential of $13 per bond.


          3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the accountholder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
    

          4. Fixed annuities available at Fidelity are issued by third-party insurance companies, which are not affiliated with any Fidelity Investments company. These products are distributed by Fidelity Insurance Agency, Inc., and, for certain products, Fidelity Brokerage Services, Member NYSE, SIPC . Some deferred fixed annuities have a market value adjustment (MVA), which generally applies if a client surrenders the contract or withdraws funds in excess of the free withdrawal amount before the end of the guarantee period. The amount the client receives will be adjusted based on interest rate conditions at that time.


Each individual's situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested. Although deferred fixed annuities offer tax-deferral, if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. In such cases, tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the deferred fixed annuity.
	
    

          5. A contract's financial guarantees are solely the responsibility of and are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.


You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund.


          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Fidelity makes certain new issue products available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity may receive compensation from issuers for participating in the offering as a selling group member and/or underwriter. For representative assisted treasury auction orders, a $19.95 transaction fee applies.
	
    

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Reasons to consider bond funds 

Potential for capital preservation, depending on the fund
Income generation
Diversification for a potential hedge against stock market volatility
Liquidity

Funds are guided by a stated objective, generally focusing on a particular sector, such as corporate or Treasury bonds; a broad category, such as investment grade or high yield securities; or a specific time horizon, such as short-, intermediate-, or long-term bonds.
How Fidelity manages bond funds










Types of bond funds



Investment grade

Invest in high credit quality securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, and U.S. corporations, as well as bonds backed by mortgages or other assets. Learn more about types of investment grade bond funds.

High yield

Invest primarily in lower credit quality securities, including convertible securities. While these can potentially provide income and total returns higher than those offered by investment grade bond funds, they do have the potential for greater volatility and risk. Learn more about types of high yield bond funds.
Research high yield bond funds



Multisector

High-yield/non-investment-grade bonds involve greater price volatility and risk of default than investment-grade bonds.


Investments in mortgage securities are subject to the risk that principal will be repaid prior to maturity.  As a result, when interest rates decline, gains may be reduced, and when interest rates rise, losses may be greater.


          * The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Income exempt from federal income tax may be subject to state or local tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. All or a portion of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Income or fund distributions attributable to capital gains are usually subject to both state and federal income taxes. Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.

You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.


          2.
	
	
	       You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Because the share price of the fund will fluctuate, when you sell your shares they may be worth more or less than what you originally paid for them. The Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund’s liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to the fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.

          The municipal market can be affected by adverse tax, legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. Interest rate increases can cause the price of a money market security to decrease. Municipal funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Certain funds normally seek to invest only in municipal securities generating income exempt from both federal income taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax; however, outcomes cannot be guaranteed, and the funds may sometimes generate income subject to these taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds.


Generally, tax-exempt municipal securities are not appropriate holdings for tax advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.
	
    

          * Other fees and expenses applicable to continued investment are described in the fund's current prospectus.

          In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
    

There is an Options Regulatory Fee from $0.04 to $0.06 per contract, which applies to both option buy and sell transactions. The fee is subject to change.


Stock markets are volatile and can fluctuate significantly in response to company, industry, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Investing in stock involves risks, including the loss of principal.


Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.


System availability and response times may be subject to market conditions.


Before investing in any mutual fund, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

			Equity
			: Real Assets



			About Real Assets

			Real Assets are tangible raw materials, goods, property, buildings, roads, and other constructed items
			that are consumed, used to manufacture other items, or used to live in, work in, transport people and
			goods, and provide basic services like clean water, cellular service, and electricity. Real assets include
			commodities, real estate and REITs, infrastructure, pipelines, and collectibles. To encourage investments
			in these often-essential projects, governments sometimes grant special tax treatment to the returns
			or cash flows of some of these projects.
		

			Real assets are generally considered to be inflation hedges, since when the costs of goods and services
			rise (inflation increases), so does the demand for raw materials, energy, and physical systems also
			typically rise. In addition, they have historically had low 
				correlations with traditional financial assets such as stocks and bonds.



					About REITs

					Many real estate investments seek to provide attractive, growing dividends. A Real Estate Investment
					Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, and usually operates, income-producing commercial real estate,
					such as apartments, shopping centers, offices, hotels and warehouses. Most REITs are publicly-traded.
				

					A real estate investment trust is a tax designation for a corporate entity which can invest in real
					estate. The overall purpose of REITs designation is to reduce corporate income taxes, and in return
					REITs are required to distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.
				

Historically, real estate investments such as REITs often have had relatively low correlations with other
						types of investments. Their total return typically relies on both cash flows from rents, and any capital
						appreciation. 


REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values and
						rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. In addition, REITs depend on liquid
						credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular sectors of the commercial
						real estate market. 


					For additional explanation please visit 
						NAREITs (the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts).
Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund (JRS)

			
					The fund invests at least 90% of its total assets in income producing common stocks, preferred stocks,
					convertible preferred stocks and debt securities issued by real estate companies; at least 80% of its
					total assets in income producing equity securities issued by REITs; and will not invest more than 25%
					of its total assets in non-investment grade preferred stocks, convertible preferred stocks and debt
					securities. The fund uses leverage.
				
				
					About Infrastructure

					Infrastructure refers to physical constructed items such as roads, bridges, water treatment, communications
					transmission, prisons, and other projects and systems that are needed or desired to support a country’s
					or business’s economic development. Infrastructure projects may be funded publicly, privately, or through
					public-private partnerships.
				

					Demand for financing infrastructure is influenced by worldwide population growth, urbanization, economic
					recovery, and maintenance and modernization of existing infrastructure.
				

The total return of infrastructure investments typically relies on cash flows from tolls or usage fees,
						as well as potential capital appreciation (when structured as an equity or stock) or pay back of principal
						(when structured as a bond or debt obligation). 


Like REITs, values, rents, and usage fees may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments.
						Some infrastructure investments may have smaller capitalization and thus lower liquidity, and global
						infrastructure investments may be subject to additional risks associated with emerging markets and different
						legal and financial systems.
Nuveen Real Asset Income and Growth
							Fund (JRI)

					Under normal market conditions, JRI’s Managed Assets will be invested:
					At least 80% in equity and debt securities issued by real asset related companies located anywhere in
						the world. 
No more than 40%, at the time of purchase, in debt securities. 
All of the Fund’s debt securities may be rated lower than investment grade quality (BB+/Ba1 or lower);
						no more than 10% the Fund’s Managed Assets may be invested in debt securities rated CCC+/Caa1 or lower
						at any time. 
At least 25% and no more than 75% in securities of non-U.S. issuers through the direct investment in
						securities of non-U.S. companies and depositary receipts.1


					JRI will employ, to a limited extent, an integrated and dynamic option writing strategy focused on securities
					issued by real asset related companies that seeks to generate option premiums for the purpose of enhancing
					the Fund’s risk-adjusted total returns over time. Initially, the notional value of the options will
					range from 5% to 10% of Managed Assets.2


					{1} A negotiable financial instrument issued by a bank to represent a foreign company’s publicly traded
					securities. The depositary receipt trades on a local stock exchange.
					

					{2} Over extended periods of time, the notional value of the call options written by the Fund may range
					from 0% to 25% of Managed Assets, depending on market conditions and Nuveen Asset Management’s ongoing
					assessment of the attractiveness of writing call options from a risk- adjusted return standpoint. There
					can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund’s risk-adjusted returns
					over any particular period may be positive or negative.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds might be especially appealing to investors seeking:
							

Potential for enhanced portfolio returns; 
High current income potential; 
Opportunity for capital growth.


								What are potential risks of REITS?

REIT performance is linked to the performance of the commercial real estate market. Property values
									and rents may fall due to economic, legal, or cultural developments. 
REITs depend on liquid credit markets, and there may also be special risks associated with particular
									sectors of the commercial real estate market.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
