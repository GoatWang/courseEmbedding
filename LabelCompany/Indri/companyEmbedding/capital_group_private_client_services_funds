Award-winning wealth management with a highly personal touch.
In today’s ever-changing world, companies claiming to offer investment and wealth management services abound. Yet finding the right firm — one you can trust implicitly to steer your assets and set you on the right path now and for future generations — has never been more difficult.
You want an organization with access to global research, extensive wealth planning resources, trust capabilities, a total commitment to client service and a long history of delivering consistent results.
In other words, you want a firm like Capital Group Private Client Services.

 What Sets Us Apart From Other Wealth Managers 








 
 
















  A Brief Introduction  











You’ve worked hard to build your wealth. Our sole mission is to help you grow, protect and enjoy it.
Our firm was founded more than four decades ago as a family office for Capital Group’s senior executives and their families. We have since expanded into a full-service wealth management and trust company, overseeing some $22 billion in assets for a select group of discriminating high-net-worth individuals, trusts, foundations and endowments nationwide.
Though we are an exclusive boutique, and maintain a relatively small number of client relationships, we are able to tap into in-depth, world-class research and portfolio management experience from around the globe.
As we like to say, we’re big where it counts and small where it matters, and it’s one reason we’ve earned such a strong reputation in the industry.
Clients have access to our in-house Wealth Advisory Group, which works with our team of highly experienced Investment Counselors in such areas as:

Asset allocation
Retirement planning
Philanthropy
Tax management
Concentrated stock diversification
Business transition strategies
Wealth transfer techniques

 The Origins of Our Firm 








 
 















  Our Rich History  











The founder of our organization was driven, hardworking and accomplished - just like our clients.
When Jonathan Bell Lovelace started the Capital Group organization back in 1931, the young broker had already built an impressive track record and emerged from the crash of 1929 virtually unscathed.
Though Lovelace started out small, he and his team grew Capital Group into one of the largest and most respected investment management companies in the business. Today the organization has more than 7,000 associates, offices around the globe and more than $1.3 trillion in assets under management.
Lovelace was a pioneer in the industry and guided Capital Group to become one of the first investment firms to embrace the now widely accepted practice of global investing.
Despite Capital’s incredible growth over the years, people often say they don’t know much about us. That’s largely because the firm prefers to keep its eye on doing what’s best for clients — and we tend to avoid the media spotlight.
As a privately held organization, Capital Group strives to generate superior long-term results, not to become famous. Nevertheless, it’s likely that you are familiar with our affiliate, American Funds, which is one of the nation’s largest mutual fund families. Capital Group is well known on Wall Street and in C-suite boardrooms because of our outstanding reputation.
What’s more, Capital Group is the subject of the noted book Capital: The Story of Long-Term Investment Excellence by Charles D. Ellis and we consistently have been recognized by industry peers for our superior wealth management capabilities.

 Our Money is Invested With Yours 








 
 















  Typical Client Profile  











Accomplished. Influential. Enterprising. Selective.
These are among the traits of the clients we work with every day.
Though we manage wealth for people from all walks of life, they tend to have several things in common: they are highly successful, they have amassed great wealth, they demand complete confidentiality and they appreciate the peace of mind we provide by tending to the important details of their finances so they can focus on what’s important in their lives.
From entrepreneurs and CEOs to celebrities, retired executives and even professional investment managers, we have an impressive list of clients who have entrusted us with preserving their wealth and managing it in a way that allows them to achieve their varied financial goals.
Given our high retention rate and commitment to quality service, it’s no wonder that Barron’s has recognized Capital Group Private Client Services as one of the nation’s top wealth management firms.1 We have also been cited as “Best Wealth Manager over $5 Billion” by Private Asset Management magazine twice in recent years.
1”America’s Top 40 Wealth Management Firms,” Barron’s, September 26, 2015. Top firms based on assets under management.

 The Wide Range of Clients We Serve 








 
 















  Benefits of Our Ownership Structure  











Being privately held means we only have to answer to one constituency — our clients.
From day one, Capital Group Private Client Services and its parent organization have been owned primarily by the people who work here every day. Private ownership is a cornerstone of our ability to think long-term when it comes to planning and investing.
Among other things, it allows us to avoid the quarterly earnings pressures that can constrain publicly traded companies and lead to short-term thinking. It also gives us the freedom to put client needs first and make strategic decisions that benefit you rather than outside shareholders.
Capital Group maintains a strong and stable financial foundation. Our financial strength underpins how we manage the organization, allowing us to take the long view on all decisions. That didn’t happen by accident. We strive to ensure the firm is on solid financial ground in both good times and bad.
Such prudence has served us and our clients well, allowing Capital to remain a vibrant, sound organization even during the most challenging periods.

One of the most effective ways to extend your wishes, values and aspirations far into the future is through a carefully constructed and executed trust.
With proper estate planning, you can maintain your current lifestyle while establishing your family’s legacy, supporting a charity, protecting important assets and reducing estate taxes.
A trust is simply an arrangement used to transfer property to a reliable third party (known as a trustee) for the benefit of others.
In addition to constructing the trust with a legal professional, selecting the right trustee to administer your assets is one of the most important aspects of the estate planning process. After all, your trustee is charged with carrying out your wishes well into the future.
It is critical to choose a trustee you can depend on, with the experience to get the job done.













VIDEO




 


















 Key Considerations When Appointing a Trustee 

 




 
 
















  Selecting a Trustee  











Choosing the right trustee to administer your assets is one of the most important aspects of estate planning.
It is essential to appoint someone you can completely trust — ideally with a long track record and experience working with many types of trust vehicles.
Though some people choose friends or relatives for this role, appointing a corporate trustee has many advantages and can take a significant burden off of you and your loved ones.
After all, a corporate trustee has expertise not only in investment management, but also in filling out cumbersome paperwork, filing required tax forms and managing distributions. 












VIDEO




 















 Benefits of Using Capital as a Corporate Trustee 

 




 
 















  Our Trust Credentials  











Capital Group Private Client Services was formed more than 35 years ago specifically to serve as trustee for senior executives of our parent organization.
We’ve since opened our doors to a broader group of clients while maintaining the same level of uncompromised integrity and highly personalized service for every relationship.
Our Trust Relationship Specialists are steadfastly focused on carrying out clients’ wishes exactly as they intended. We take pride in being a trusted fiduciary you can count on to take excellent care of your beneficiaries for the life of the trust — be it years or decades to come.
We understand the important responsibility that being a trustee entails. As a boutique firm within a larger organization, we have far-reaching resources, yet maintain a personal connection with each client. We are dedicated to consistently providing you, your loved ones and your cherished organizations with the highest level of service, taking a “hand-crafted” approach to each trust, instead of offering an inventory of one-size-fits-all solutions. 












VIDEO




 















 How Serving as Trustee Became Part of Our DNA 

 




 
 















  Our Approach to Trusts  











We conduct our trust business far differently from what you might expect or have experienced elsewhere.
When you, and ultimately your beneficiaries, have a question about your trust, you’re not routed to an automated call center — a common practice with other firms. Instead, you speak directly with a dedicated Trust Relationship Specialist who knows you personally and understands the details of your trust, your objectives and your values.
We are committed to attracting and retaining seasoned professionals. Our Trust Relationship Specialists come to their jobs with extensive hands-on client experience and develop deep, long-lasting connections with the families they serve.
They are focused on implementing your wishes exactly as you have directed — now and in the future.












VIDEO




 















 Building Blocks of an Effective Estate Plan 

 




 
 















  Types of Trusts We Administer  











We have significant in-house trust experience, allowing us broad flexibility to preserve your wishes well into the future.
We are able to administer a wide range of trust vehicles, including:

Charitable remainder trusts
Family trusts
Generation-skipping trusts
Grantor retained annuity trusts (GRATs)
IRA rollover trusts
Living trusts
Marital trusts
Revocable living trusts
Special-needs trusts
Testamentary trusts
Trusts for minors

We will work with you and your advisors to set up an appropriate structure for your trust and craft your portfolio around the specific goals of both you and your beneficiaries.
Our trust services will foster the orderly intergenerational transfer of wealth in accordance with your wishes. We will provide proactive reporting and communications to keep you and your beneficiaries up to date, along with complete recordkeeping, ongoing management of distributions and tax filing to meet federal and state requirements.
