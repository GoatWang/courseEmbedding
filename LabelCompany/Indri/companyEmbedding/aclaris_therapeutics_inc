Aclaris Therapeutics Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on dermatology, has raised $21 million. The Series A was led by Vivo Ventures and Fidelity Biosciences with participation from Sofinnova Ventures. The money will be used for product development.

PRESS RELEASE
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing dermatological therapeutics, announced today that it has secured $21 million in Series A financing. The Series A was led by Vivo Ventures and Fidelity Biosciences with participation from Sofinnova Ventures. Proceeds from the financing will be used to fund the development of a novel topical dermatological product.
Dr. Neal Walker, a board-certified dermatologist and experienced entrepreneur, will lead Aclaris as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director. Dr. Walker has co-founded a number of life-science companies and brings more than eighteen years of pharmaceutical industry experience in research and development, regulatory affairs and business development to Aclaris. Most recently, Dr. Walker served as Founder, CEO and Director of Vicept Therapeutics, which was acquired by Allergan in July 2011. Dr. Walker also co-founded Octagon Research Solutions, Inc. and served as its Director until its recent acquisition by Accenture in August 2012.
“We brought together our experienced management team from Vicept to create a new company that will be focused on the development of therapeutics for dermatologists and their patients,” said Dr. Walker, President and CEO of Aclaris. “We appreciate that our key former investors also support our vision for Aclaris and have funded this Series A financing to help us acquire and advance new therapeutics to the market.” 





Stephen Tullman, the former Executive Chairman of Vicept, will serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Aclaris. He currently serves as President and CEO of Ceptaris Therapeutics, Inc. In addition, he is Managing Partner of NeXeption, a biotechnology management company formed to identify and acquire novel drug candidates that address unmet medical needs. Previously, he cofounded and led several companies including Ception Therapeutics, a biologics company (acquired by Cephalon).
Albert Cha, M.D., Ph.D. and Ketan Patel, M.D. will join Mr. Tullman and Dr. Walker on the Board of Directors of Aclaris. Dr. Cha is a managing partner at Vivo Ventures, where he invests in private and public biopharmaceutical and medical device companies. Dr. Patel is a principal with Fidelity Biosciences, where he focuses on investing in private life sciences companies globally.
“Vivo is excited about Aclaris because we believe in the management team, the product, and continued need for novel dermatologic treatments,” said Albert Cha, M.D., Ph.D., Managing Partner of Vivo Ventures. “The Aclaris team has a proven track record of identifying and rapidly developing novel products that address unmet patient needs.”
The Aclaris management team is rounded out with experienced leaders who also served with Dr. Walker at Vicept including Christopher Powala, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Shanler, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer; Frank Ruffo, Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Beger, Vice President of Clinical Operations.

Why Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Stock Is Down Today
The pharma's shares dipped on a $65 million capital raise.











                George Budwell
            

                (TMFGBudwell)



            
            Nov 17, 2016 at 11:00AM

What happened
Shares of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS), a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company, fell by more than 10% in early morning trading on Thursday. This southward move was sparked by a $65 million public offering intended to fund the regulatory filing of Aclaris' lead product candidate, A-101, a topical solution for the treatment of a fairly common noncancerous skin growth known as seborrheic keratosis (SK); and to potentially raise a sales force upon its approval. 





So what
Aclaris recently announced positive top-line results from A-101's twin pivotal late-stage trials, where this topical solution effectively cleared a highly significant percentage of SK lesions in comparison to patients receiving placebo. While this clinical development is certainly great news for shareholders going forward, the fact of the matter is that the biotech's last stated cash position of $84 million simply wasn't enough for it to successfully transition into the commercial phase of its life cycle. Simply put, this sizable secondary offering is a necessary evil right now -- but one that could pay bigger dividends down the road.
Now what
Aclaris is hoping to have A-101's regulatory filing in the hands of the FDA sometime in first quarter of 2017. So, if that line holds, this prescription topical solution could reach the market by perhaps the fourth quarter of next year.
On the valuation side of the ledger, A-101 has the potential to be a particularly important catalyst for the company going forward. After all, 83 million Americans are reportedly afflicted with non-cancerous skin lesions, meaning that this product candidate would only have to capture a small slice of this huge market to be a noteworthy revenue source for a company with a market cap of $446 million at preset.
All in all, A-101's fairly strong late-stage results and its compelling market opportunity arguably merit a deeper look at this speculative biotech stock -- even though investors should always bear in mind that nothing is ever a sure thing when it comes to the FDA.

MALVERN, Pa., May 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACRS), a dermatologist-led biotechnology company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) A-101 40% topical solution (A-101 40%), an investigational drug, for the potential treatment of seborrheic keratosis (SK), a common skin condition.
The NDA acceptance by the FDA in its 74-day letter indicates that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA’s review of the NDA is December 24, 2017. If approved, A-101 40% would be the first FDA-approved topical medication for the treatment of SK.
“The FDA’s acceptance of our NDA for A-101 40% is a significant achievement that brings Aclaris one step closer to providing an innovative treatment option for SK patients and the physicians who treat the condition,” said Christopher Powala, Chief Operating Officer of Aclaris. “There is a significant need for a non-invasive, topical SK treatment as SK often appears in highly visible locations like the face and neck and can adversely affect patients’ emotional well-being.”
About A-101
A-101 40% topical solution, an investigational drug, is a proprietary, high-concentration hydrogen peroxide formulation for the treatment of seborrheic keratosis (SK). It is being developed as a non-invasive, in-office treatment administered by physicians or other licensed health care professionals.  In clinical trials, patients treated with A-101 40% achieved statistically and clinically significant improvement in clearing SK lesions compared to placebo and with a similar adverse event profile. A-101 40% is designed to work by penetrating into the SK lesion and causing oxidative damage, which can ultimately result in the sloughing of the SK cells.  A-101 40% has been the focus of a robust clinical development program in which over 700 patients have been treated with A-101. The 45% concentration of A-101 is also in clinical development for the treatment of common warts (verruca vulgaris).
About Seborrheic Keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a skin condition that affects more than 83 million Americans and is characterized by non-cancerous lesions varying in color from light tan to dark brown or black.  SK lesions range in size from a millimeter to a few centimeters wide and usually have a slightly elevated, waxy, scaly appearance.  People with SK may be affected with just one lesion or dozens and often have a family history of SK.  SK lesions can appear anywhere on the body, except the palms, soles, and mucous membranes, and frequently appear in highly visible locations, such as the face or neck.  Though the lesions usually do not cause physical discomfort, SK can adversely affect the appearance and emotional well-being of people who have it.  Prevalence of SK increases with advancing age and the majority of patients seeking treatment from dermatologists are between 40 and 70 years of age.  Fewer than 10% of people with SK receive treatment, though it is one of the most frequent diagnoses made by dermatologists.  There are currently no FDA-approved medications for SK, and existing treatment procedures are often painful or invasive and can have undesirable outcomes like scarring or dyspigmentation.
About Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.
Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. is a dermatologist-led biotechnology company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology.  Aclaris is focused on large, underserved market segments with no FDA-approved medications or where treatment gaps exist.
