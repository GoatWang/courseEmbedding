Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements
are inherently uncertain as they are based on current expectations and
assumptions concerning future events or future performance of the Company.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
Forward-looking statements may contain the words "believes," "project,"
"expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "strategy,"
"plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely
result," and similar expressions, and are subject to numerous known and unknown
risks and uncertainties. Additionally, statements relating to implementation of
business strategy, future financial performance, acquisition strategies, capital
raising transactions, performance of contractual obligations, and similar
statements may contain forward-looking statements. In evaluating such
statements, prospective investors and shareholders should carefully review
various risks and uncertainties identified in this Report, including the matters
set forth under the captions "Risk Factors" and in the Company's other SEC
filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Company's actual results
to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. The
Company disclaims any obligation to update or publicly announce revisions to any
forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.
Although forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q reflect the good faith
judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and
factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes
may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated
by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to
such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those
specifically addressed under the heading "Risk Factors Related to Our Business"
below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Readers are urged
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We file reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). You can read and copy any materials we file with
the SEC at the SEC'sPublic Reference Room, 100 F. Street, NE, Washington, D.C.
20549. You can obtain additional information about the operation of the Public
Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC
maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and
information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file
electronically with the SEC, including us.
We disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in
order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers are urged to carefully review and
consider the various disclosures made throughout the entirety of this Annual
Report, which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that
may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

General Description of Business
We are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of
modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and
private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular
spaces, facilities, and properties. We are in the business of all aspects of
modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of
modular construction technology, education and development in developed and
undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction
equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing,
wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, and (c) other
businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services,
including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing
or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility
of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan
that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to
accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing
needs to accomplish our objectives; however, we believe that we are not a "shell
company," as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number is
0001697426, and we have selected June 30 as our fiscal year.
We are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China
along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive offices are located
at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered
as a foreign business entity in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office
space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North
Carolina, and a related party to the Company, as set forth below.
The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co.
("UGS"). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a
Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in
which the surviving entity's name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged
with Auto America, Inc., ("Auto America"), a Delaware corporation, through the
filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name
from USG to Auto America. From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington
automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for
Auto America for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America
filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring the Company
to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of
Incorporation changing its name to Charter Equities, Inc. ("Charter Equities").
Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008.
Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its
name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended our articles of incorporation on
June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.

Emerging Growth Company



We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be
deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total
annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation
every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth
anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the
issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued
more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer',
as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any
successor thereto.
As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes
Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual
reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and
procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the
effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires
that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and
report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure
and procedures for financial reporting.
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of
executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private
companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be
comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

The Company's revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605. The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it
is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
We can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our
products. We also rely upon the Sales and Support Services Service Agreement
with Yilaime for revenues. We are implementing a new business plan and have very
limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting in this area. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we end operations
for the fourth quarter of 2016. Entering the first Quarter of the next fiscal
year, we intend on relying on both Yilaime and AmericaTowne, Inc. for
operational support. If we cannot achieve independent commercial success, we may
need to continue to rely on Yilaime and AmericaTowne for support. If either
company at any time decides to alter or change materially our arrangement, we
could experience a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, the
results of operations are based upon a limited view since the controlling
interest was acquired and a new business plan implemented.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are
summarized as follows:



                              Three Months Ended
                      March 31, 2017      March 31, 2016
Revenue              $       125,000     $           -
Cost of Revenues     $             -     $           -
Operating Expenses   $       110,235                450

Net Income (Loss)    $        12,550     $         (450 )




-21-







Revenues

During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated revenue of $125,000. The
Company's revenues came from related parties for services rendered, $125,000 for
the service rights agreement with AmericaTowne. We can make no assurances that
we will find commercial success in any of our revenue producing contracts. Our
revenues, thus far, rely entirely on related parties. We are a new company and
thus have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we began operations
in the second quarter of 2016.
Operating Expenses


Our expenses for the first months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are outlined in
the table below:

                                     Three Months Ended
                                March 31,
                                  2017          March 31, 2016
General and Administrative   $    110,235      $            450

Total Operating Expenses     $    110,235      $            450




Our operating expenses are largely attributable to administrative expenses
related to our reporting requirements as a public company and implementation of
our business plan.
Net Income
As a result of our operations, the Company reported net income before tax
obligations of 14,765 for the first Quarter of 2017.

Increase/Decrease in Cash                   $     (4,723 )     $             -




Cash Used in Operating Activities
We have $26,362 and $0 net cash used in operating activities for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is mainly due
to increase in accounts receivable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we spent $861 on purchasing fixed
assets.

-23-







Cash Provided by Financing Activities
We received $22,500 from issuance of stock for the three months ended March 31,
2017.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on
the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and
subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can
also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures
including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition.
We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to
GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to
monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial
statements.
We believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that
impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant
accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



-24-







Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue at the date of delivery to customers when a
formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is
completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's Revenue Recognition policy
is provided in detail at Note 2 of the Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, "Income
Taxes." ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for
deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized
for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more
likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination,
with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test,
no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of
operations, financial position, or cash flow.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements
are inherently uncertain as they are based on current expectations and
assumptions concerning future events or future performance of the Company.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
Forward-looking statements may contain the words "believes," "project,"
"expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "strategy,"
"plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely
result," and similar expressions, and are subject to numerous known and unknown
risks and uncertainties. Additionally, statements relating to implementation of
business strategy, future financial performance, acquisition strategies, capital
raising transactions, performance of contractual obligations, and similar
statements may contain forward-looking statements. In evaluating such
statements, prospective investors and shareholders should carefully review
various risks and uncertainties identified in this Report, including the matters
set forth under the captions "Risk Factors" and in the Company's other SEC
filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Company's actual results
to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. The
Company disclaims any obligation to update or publicly announce revisions to any
forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.
Although forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q reflect the good faith
judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and
factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes
may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated
by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to
such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those
specifically addressed under the heading "Risk Factors Related to Our Business"
below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Readers are urged
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We file reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). You can read and copy any materials we file with
the SEC at the SEC'sPublic Reference Room, 100 F. Street, NE, Washington, D.C.
20549. You can obtain additional information about the operation of the Public
Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC
maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and
information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file
electronically with the SEC, including us.
We disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in
order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers are urged to carefully review and
consider the various disclosures made throughout the entirety of this Annual
Report, which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that
may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

General Description of Business
We are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of
modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and
private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular
spaces, facilities, and properties. We are in the business of all aspects of
modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of
modular construction technology, education and development in developed and
undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction
equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing,
wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, and (c) other
businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services,
including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing
or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility
of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan
that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to
accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing
needs to accomplish our objectives; however, we believe that we are not a "shell
company," as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number is
0001697426, and we have selected June 30 as our fiscal year.
We are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China
along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive offices are located
at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered
as a foreign business entity in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office
space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North
Carolina, and a related party to the Company, as set forth below.
The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co.
("UGS"). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a
Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in
which the surviving entity's name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged
with Auto America, Inc., ("Auto America"), a Delaware corporation, through the
filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name
from USG to Auto America. From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington
automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for
Auto America for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America
filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring the Company
to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of
Incorporation changing its name to Charter Equities, Inc. ("Charter Equities").
Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008.
Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its
name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended our articles of incorporation on
June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.

Emerging Growth Company



We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be
deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total
annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation
every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth
anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the
issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued
more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer',
as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any
successor thereto.
As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes
Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual
reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and
procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the
effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires
that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and
report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure
and procedures for financial reporting.
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of
executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private
companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be
comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

The Company's revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605. The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it
is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
We can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our
products. We also rely upon the Sales and Support Services Service Agreement
with Yilaime for revenues. We are implementing a new business plan and have very
limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting in this area. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we end operations
for the fourth quarter of 2016. Entering the first Quarter of the next fiscal
year, we intend on relying on both Yilaime and AmericaTowne, Inc. for
operational support. If we cannot achieve independent commercial success, we may
need to continue to rely on Yilaime and AmericaTowne for support. If either
company at any time decides to alter or change materially our arrangement, we
could experience a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, the
results of operations are based upon a limited view since the controlling
interest was acquired and a new business plan implemented.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are
summarized as follows:



                              Three Months Ended
                      March 31, 2017      March 31, 2016

Net Income (Loss)    $        12,550     $         (450 )




-21-







Revenues

During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated revenue of $125,000. The
Company's revenues came from related parties for services rendered, $125,000 for
the service rights agreement with AmericaTowne. We can make no assurances that
we will find commercial success in any of our revenue producing contracts. Our
revenues, thus far, rely entirely on related parties. We are a new company and
thus have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we began operations
in the second quarter of 2016.
Operating Expenses


Our expenses for the first months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are outlined in
the table below:

                                     Three Months Ended
                                March 31,
                                  2017          March 31, 2016
General and Administrative   $    110,235      $            450

Total Operating Expenses     $    110,235      $            450




Our operating expenses are largely attributable to administrative expenses
related to our reporting requirements as a public company and implementation of
our business plan.
Net Income
As a result of our operations, the Company reported net income before tax
obligations of 14,765 for the first Quarter of 2017.

Increase/Decrease in Cash                   $     (4,723 )     $             -




Cash Used in Operating Activities
We have $26,362 and $0 net cash used in operating activities for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is mainly due
to increase in accounts receivable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we spent $861 on purchasing fixed
assets.

-23-







Cash Provided by Financing Activities
We received $22,500 from issuance of stock for the three months ended March 31,
2017.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on
the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and
subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can
also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures
including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition.
We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to
GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to
monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial
statements.
We believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that
impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant
accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue at the date of delivery to customers when a
formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is
completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's Revenue Recognition policy
is provided in detail at Note 2 of the Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, "Income
Taxes." ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for
deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized
for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more
likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination,
with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test,
no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of
operations, financial position, or cash flow.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
Information included or incorporated by reference in this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements
are inherently uncertain as they are based on current expectations and
assumptions concerning future events or future performance of the Company.
Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof.
Forward-looking statements may contain the words "believes," "project,"
"expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "forecasts," "intends," "strategy,"
"plan," "may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely
result," and similar expressions, and are subject to numerous known and unknown
risks and uncertainties. Additionally, statements relating to implementation of
business strategy, future financial performance, acquisition strategies, capital
raising transactions, performance of contractual obligations, and similar
statements may contain forward-looking statements. In evaluating such
statements, prospective investors and shareholders should carefully review
various risks and uncertainties identified in this Report, including the matters
set forth under the captions "Risk Factors" and in the Company's other SEC
filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause the Company's actual results
to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. The
Company disclaims any obligation to update or publicly announce revisions to any
forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments.
Although forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q reflect the good faith
judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and
factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are
inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes
may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated
by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to
such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those
specifically addressed under the heading "Risk Factors Related to Our Business"
below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Readers are urged
not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We file reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"). You can read and copy any materials we file with
the SEC at the SEC'sPublic Reference Room, 100 F. Street, NE, Washington, D.C.
20549. You can obtain additional information about the operation of the Public
Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC
maintains an Internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and
information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file
electronically with the SEC, including us.
We disclaim any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements in
order to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers are urged to carefully review and
consider the various disclosures made throughout the entirety of this Annual
Report, which attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that
may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

General Description of Business
We are an operating company engaged in the development and the exporting of
modular energy efficient technology and processes that allow government and
private enterprises in China to use US-based methods for creating modular
spaces, facilities, and properties. We are in the business of all aspects of
modular construction, including but not limited to, (a) the furtherance of
modular construction technology, education and development in developed and
undeveloped countries, (b) acquisition and/or installation of construction
equipment, materials, furnishings, adware, insulation, flooring, roofing,
wiring, plumbing, heating and air conditioning, and landscaping, and (c) other
businesses directly or tangentially related to these lines of services,
including assisting businesses and entrepreneurs in securing naming, licensing
or promotional rights, driving internet and media traffic, increasing visibility
of product and name recognition, and other services. As with any business plan
that is aspirational in nature, there is no assurance we will be able to
accomplish all of our objectives or that we will be able to meet our financing
needs to accomplish our objectives; however, we believe that we are not a "shell
company," as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Our CIK number is
0001697426, and we have selected June 30 as our fiscal year.
We are currently evaluating a physical location for our operations in China
along with a manufacturing facility. Our principal executive offices are located
at 4700 Homewood Court, Suite 100 in Raleigh, North Carolina. We are registered
as a foreign business entity in the State of North Carolina. We lease the office
space from Yilaime Corporation, a Nevada corporation doing business in North
Carolina, and a related party to the Company, as set forth below.
The Company was incorporated on January 2, 1969 as United Gold & Silver Co.
("UGS"). On February 17, 1971, UGS merged with Lucky Irish Silver, Inc., a
Montana corporation, and Deep Creek Mines, Inc., a Washington corporation, in
which the surviving entity's name remained USG. On November 29, 1999, USG merged
with Auto America, Inc., ("Auto America"), a Delaware corporation, through the
filing of Articles of Merger resulting in the surviving entity changing its name
from USG to Auto America. From 2002 to 2007, the State of Washington
automatically filed numerous Certificates of Administrative Dissolutions for
Auto America for failure to file annual reports. On May 14, 2007, Auto America
filed its final Application of Reinstatement resulting in restoring the Company
to good standing. Also, on May 14, 2007, Auto America filed Amended Articles of
Incorporation changing its name to Charter Equities, Inc. ("Charter Equities").
Charter Equities converted to an Arizona corporation on January 23, 2008.
Shortly thereafter, the Company converted to Nevada corporation and changed its
name to Global Recycle Energy, Inc. We amended our articles of incorporation on
June 27, 2016, changing our name to ATI Modular Technology Corp.

Emerging Growth Company



We are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. We shall continue to be
deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of:
(a) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer during which it had total
annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as such amount is indexed for inflation
every 5 years by the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price
Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
setting the threshold to the nearest 1,000,000) or more;
(b) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth
anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the
issuer pursuant to an effective IPO registration statement;
(c) the date on which such issuer has, during the previous 3-year period, issued
more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or
(d) the date on which such issuer is deemed to be a 'large accelerated filer',
as defined in section 240.12b-2 of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, or any
successor thereto.
As an emerging growth company we are exempt from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes
Oxley. Section 404(a) requires Issuers to publish information in their annual
reports concerning the scope and adequacy of the internal control structure and
procedures for financial reporting. This statement shall also assess the
effectiveness of such internal controls and procedures. Section 404(b) requires
that the registered accounting firm shall, in the same report, attest to and
report on the assessment on the effectiveness of the internal control structure
and procedures for financial reporting.
As an emerging growth company we are also exempt from Section 14A (a) and (b) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which require the shareholder approval of
executive compensation and golden parachutes. We have elected to use the
extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting
standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the
adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective
dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private
companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be
comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.

The Company's revenue recognition policies comply with FASB ASC Topic 605. The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it
is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the
services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or
determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
We can make no assurances that we will find commercial success in any of our
products. We also rely upon the Sales and Support Services Service Agreement
with Yilaime for revenues. We are implementing a new business plan and have very
limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting in this area. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we end operations
for the fourth quarter of 2016. Entering the first Quarter of the next fiscal
year, we intend on relying on both Yilaime and AmericaTowne, Inc. for
operational support. If we cannot achieve independent commercial success, we may
need to continue to rely on Yilaime and AmericaTowne for support. If either
company at any time decides to alter or change materially our arrangement, we
could experience a material adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, the
results of operations are based upon a limited view since the controlling
interest was acquired and a new business plan implemented.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016
Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are
summarized as follows:



                              Three Months Ended
                      March 31, 2017      March 31, 2016

Net Income (Loss)    $        12,550     $         (450 )

Revenues

During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated revenue of $125,000. The
Company's revenues came from related parties for services rendered, $125,000 for
the service rights agreement with AmericaTowne. We can make no assurances that
we will find commercial success in any of our revenue producing contracts. Our
revenues, thus far, rely entirely on related parties. We are a new company and
thus have very limited experience in sales expectations and forecasting. We also
have not fully discovered any seasonality to our business as we began operations
in the second quarter of 2016.
Operating Expenses


Our expenses for the first months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 are outlined in
the table below:

                                     Three Months Ended
                                March 31,
                                  2017          March 31, 2016
General and Administrative   $    110,235      $            450

Total Operating Expenses     $    110,235      $            450




Our operating expenses are largely attributable to administrative expenses
related to our reporting requirements as a public company and implementation of
our business plan.
Net Income
As a result of our operations, the Company reported net income before tax
obligations of 14,765 for the first Quarter of 2017.

Cash Used in Operating Activities
We have $26,362 and $0 net cash used in operating activities for the three
months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is mainly due
to increase in accounts receivable.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we spent $861 on purchasing fixed
assets.

-23-







Cash Provided by Financing Activities
We received $22,500 from issuance of stock for the three months ended March 31,
2017.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies
Our financial statements and related public financial information are based on
the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
("US GAAP"). US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and
subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can
also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures
including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition.
We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to
GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to
monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial
statements.
We believe the following is among the most critical accounting policies that
impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant
accounting policies, as described in our financial statements in the Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue at the date of delivery to customers when a
formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is
completed, no other significant obligations of the Company exist and
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company's Revenue Recognition policy
is provided in detail at Note 2 of the Financial Statements.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, "Income
Taxes." ASC 740 requires a company to use the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for
deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized
for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences
between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of
enactment.
Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more
likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination,
with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the
largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
on examination. For tax positions not meeting the "more likely than not" test,
no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company's
consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company's results of
operations, financial position, or cash flow.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses
