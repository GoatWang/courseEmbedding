We are always ready to bring innovative applications to new and emerging markets to fit our customers’ needs. We achieve this by becoming more intimate with our customers, building trust through new products and enhanced solutions that meet their business needs.
We strive for continuous innovation to meet global needs.
By 2030, the global middle class will more than double in size, from 2 billion to 4.9 billion people. That translates into billions of people wanting not just better things, but better lives. It is here at the intersection of demand and opportunity that The Chemours Company vision of Higher Value Chemistry  can make a difference.

History[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its "performance chemicals" business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[2] DuPont filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called "The Chemours Company".[3] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours' stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[4] Its 180,920,858 shares of common stock were distributed to DuPont shareholders at a par value of one cent each. Chemours has assumed various liabilities arising from lawsuits against DuPont encountered in the normal course of business.[5]
Products[edit]
Chemours manufactures and sells performance chemicals falling within three segments: Titanium Technologies (titanium dioxide); Fluoroproducts (refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives including Freon, Teflon and Viton); and Chemical Solutions (cyanide, sulfuric acid, aniline, methylamines, and reactive metals).

History[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its "performance chemicals" business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[2] DuPont filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called "The Chemours Company".[3] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours' stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[4] Its 180,920,858 shares of common stock were distributed to DuPont shareholders at a par value of one cent each. Chemours has assumed various liabilities arising from lawsuits against DuPont encountered in the normal course of business.[5]
Products[edit]
Chemours manufactures and sells performance chemicals falling within three segments: Titanium Technologies (titanium dioxide); Fluoroproducts (refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives including Freon, Teflon and Viton); and Chemical Solutions (cyanide, sulfuric acid, aniline, methylamines, and reactive metals).

A Strong Case for Selling Chemours Co.
The current thinking is that toxic pollutant legal cases are behind the company. But recent developments hint they may just be getting started.











                Maxx Chatsko
            

                (TMFBlacknGold)



            
            Jun 26, 2017 at 8:12AM
            
            





It has been a fantastic year for specialty chemical manufacturer Chemours (NYSE:CC). The stock is up 67% year to date. Part of those gains is due to improving market conditions for its leading product groups: titanium dioxide and fluoroproducts. The company increased manufacturing volumes and prices in the first quarter of 2017, which pushed operating income for the period higher than the previous eight quarters combined. Not bad. 
The other part of the stock's gain this year is owed to the removal of legal uncertainty. In February, Chemours and DuPont (NYSE:DD) announced they had reached a $670 million settlement with thousands of residents in Ohio and West Virginia relating to chemical pollution of waterways. While that's a relatively large amount, investors and funds were fearing a much larger financial agreement in the court battle that lasted over a decade, which had put downward pressure on the stock. Now that the issue is resolved, and market conditions for its lead products are improving, Wall Street doesn't appear to have any reservations.
Unfortunately, that is probably all about to change.

Socially responsible investors beware
The legal settlement centers on a highly toxic chemical known as PFOA, which was previously used in the United States to manufacture various fluoroproducts, including the famous non-stick coating Teflon. While it had been used since the 1950s, it only drew the scrutiny of scientists and public health officials in the last 15 years. It has since been strongly linked to a host of health issues including pregnancy-induced hypertension, kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis, and even high cholesterol. The lawsuit was specifically for the company's Washington, West Virginia, fluoroproduct facility, which is one of nine in the United States operated by Chemours and one of 18 it owns globally. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency eventually took action, essentially forcing American chemical manufacturers to stop using PFOA by the end of 2015. It also set a recommended exposure limit in drinking water to 0.07 parts per billion. To put that -- and the dire health concerns of PFOA -- into perspective, the EPA exposure limit for lead in drinking water is 15 ppb. 





While it's another unfortunate example of the unknown risks of legacy chemicals from the 20th century that are rarely tested by the EPA, Chemours and DuPont have Wall Street thinking that the legal settlement announced in February is the end of the story. After all, they say they no longer use nor create PFOA during the manufacturing of fluoroproducts.
A report in a local newspaper in North Carolina should make investors begin to reconsider the risks posed to the business from its fluoroproducts manufacturing operations, which make significant contributions to the overall business.

Data Source: SEC filings. 
On June 22, the Port City Daily shed more light on an ongoing dispute between the EPA and a chemical manufacturing site in Fayetteville, North Carolina, that is discharging high levels of PFOA into the local waterways. Three companies share a wastewater facility and wastewater permit at the site: Kuraray, DuPont, and Chemours. In fact, there's only one pipe discharging processed water from the site into the local waterways, which is making it difficult to tell exactly who is responsible.





Some simple deduction points a finger in one direction. DuPont is only listed on the permit because it was the predecessor to Chemours, which still manufactures fluoroproducts at the site. Meanwhile, Kuraray acquired laminated glass manufacturing facilities at the site from DuPont, but those production processes don't use PFOA, according to the company. That only leaves one possible polluter.
This may be a "he said, she said" dispute at the moment, but even if Kuraray is the culprit, in the end, Chemours investors shouldn't breathe a sigh of relief just yet. There are two reasons.
First, Chemours and DuPont could still face legal cases for other fluoroproduct manufacturing sites in the United States or elsewhere in the world, namely in Europe, Brazil, and Asia. The $670 million settlement reached in February only covered one manufacturing site. 

CC data by YCharts.





Second, the Cape Fear Watershed in North Carolina -- where the Fayetteville site discharges water -- has become a hotspot for studying the new chemicals being used to replace PFOA. For DuPont and Chemours, that's usually a chemical they call GenX, which is similar to PFOA and not as well studied. 
What is available in the scientific literature isn't adding up very favorably for Chemours. Scientists from respected universities and the even the EPA have found levels of GenX in Cape Fear that greatly exceed levels of PFOA (which still exceed EPA-mandated limits). While research on the possible health effects of GenX is underway, it has demonstrated toxicity in lab animal studies that warrants additional study. The EPA even raised concerns about the chemical, stating that it "will persist in the environment, could bioaccumulate, and be toxic to people, wild mammals, and birds" based on its similarities to PFOA. Yet, the agency approved it for use anyway and currently does not impose drinking water limits for GenX. 
Should that happen in the future, DuPont and Chemours could be on the hook for additional fines and legal liabilities. The latter's fluoroproduct business could also face increased competition if consumers and customers decide to turn away from the unique class of chemicals. Given their importance and (as of today) unmatched properties, that could be a long shot without harsh restrictions handed down by the EPA or international treaties (which already exist for fluoroproduct precursors). Then again, there is a precedent for eliminating toxic and environmentally harmful industrial chemicals on a global scale. PFOA and its replacements harm both.
What does it mean for investors?
The incredible toxicity of PFOA has brought increased regulatory and scientific scrutiny to fluoroproducts and the chemicals used in their production. With multiple studies underway researching potential links to Gen X and health issues and the similarities to PFOA, investors should know that the odds of additional hefty fines or legal settlements are much greater than zero. Wall Street isn't currently pricing this additional risk into the stock, but I wouldn't want to be a shareholder when analysts wake up and see storm clouds on the horizon.

Chemours Inaugurates New Altamira TiO2 Production Line in Mexico


September 22, 2016

Download this Press Release ()



WILMINGTON, Del., Sept. 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Chemours Company (Chemours) (NYSE: CC), a global chemistry company with leading market positions in titanium technologies, fluoroproducts and chemical solutions, today formally inaugurated its new titanium dioxide (TiO2) production line at its Altamira plant in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.  
In May of this year, Chemours announced the commercial start-up of the new line for customer qualifications; the line uses the Chemours chloride process to produce Ti-Pure™ TiO2 pigment.  Production on the new line is expected to ramp up steadily, with full capacity of 200,000 metric tons per year being achieved over the next several years. In addition to its Altamira plant, Chemours manufactures TiO2 products at sites in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Taiwan. The company will balance production across these facilities to meet customers' needs as the new Altamira line increases capacity.
Bryan Snell, president of Chemours Titanium Technologies, participated in the ceremonies to mark the official opening of the new production line. He was joined by Jose Antonio Chouza, commercial director for Chemours Titanium Technologies in Latin America, as well as Mexican Secretary of the Economy Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, Tamaulipas Governor Egidio Torre Cantú, and other federal, state and local government officials from Mexico.  
"The expansion we celebrate today demonstrates our confidence in, and our commitment to, the future of the TiO2 industry," said Snell. "We are proud to be the global leader in producing high-quality titanium dioxide pigments. This new production line will help us deliver on our long-term commitment to serving our global customers with a product that delivers high-performance without compromising quality or environmental sustainability."
"In addition to increasing the future production capacity of our plant, this expansion has generated thousands of local jobs," said Chouza. "During the three-year construction project, 3,000 contractor jobs were created. The production expansion also means 200 new direct jobs, one-quarter of which are filled by women."
Chemours has the lowest sustainable TiO2 production cost in the world due to facility scale, proprietary process and know-how, and the ability to use a wide variety of ore feedstocks. The company anticipates that it will reduce overall costs of TiO2 manufacturing by at least $20 million annually.

WILMINGTON, Del., May 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The Chemours Company (Chemours) (NYSE:   CC), a global chemistry company with leading market positions in titanium technologies, fluoroproducts and chemical solutions, takes another step in its five-point transformation plan by investing in large-scale manufacturing  to expand supply of its Opteon™ family of products.










 







							 		The Chemours Company announced that it will invest $230 million to construct a facility at its site near Corpus Christi, Texas, to manufacture Opteon(tm) YF, a refrigerant with 99.9 percent lower global warming potential than the refrigerant it was designed to replace.
							  



 

 
 



Chemours will invest $230 million over three years to construct the new facility at the Chemours Corpus Christi site in Ingleside, Texas, with start-up expected in third quarter of 2018.  This investment will triple capacity of Opteon™ products, enabling Chemours to capitalize on a cornerstone growth opportunity.
The Opteon™ portfolio is a breakthrough line of solutions with very low Global Warming Potential (GWP). The new site will use an innovative, patented process to manufacture Opteon™ YF (HFO-1234yf), which is used in automotive air conditioning and in Opteon™ refrigerant blends for a range of applications.  
"Opteon™ products were developed in response to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and in many cases they perform better than the products they replace," said Mark Vergnano, president and CEO. "This is another step in our transformation plan, and is a shining example of how Chemours is investing in innovative growth opportunities as we become a higher value chemistry company, delivering essential solutions that improve the quality of life."
This investment will create the world's largest facility for manufacturing hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), and the location will allow Chemours to efficiently serve the growing market in North America and Europe, as well as the rest of the world. Today Chemours is the capacity leader for HFO-1234yf-based products, a position that will be maintained through this investment.
Expanded capacity will enable Chemours to meet customer needs in the face of exponential growth in demand for Opteon™ products.

Chemours to stop fluoropolymer byproduct disposal in US

Chemours Co. has announced that it is voluntarily stopping the disposal of wastewater that contains the byproduct GenX, generated from fluoromonomers production at its manufacturing plant in Fayetteville, N.C.
The announcement came in response to local media reports in May claiming traces of GenX had been found in the local Cape Fear River and North Carolina drinking water.
"Trace GenX amounts in the Cape Fear River to date have been well below the health screening level announced by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on 12 June," said the DuPont performance chemicals spin-off in a June 20 statement.
The company, it added, continues to believe that emissions from its Fayetteville facility have not impacted the safety of drinking water.
But the Wilmington, Del. company said it would "capture, remove, and safely dispose of wastewater that contains the byproduct GenX" as part of its role as a big employer in the community.
The capture and removal of this wastewater starts June 21.
The move follows a 2013 decision by the then DuPont unit to phase out perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) at the Fayetteville site due to its toxic nature.
GenX is used to replace PFOA, which is an ingredient in its Teflon brand.
Chemours said it would continue to work closely with local and state officials to answer questions, provide information as needed, and determine next steps.
Chemours is also being investigated by the Netherlands for alleged dumping of the substance into water.
The company has responded to allegations by the Dutch minister of infrastructure and environment that the contamination in the nearby Merwede River had occurred through the air.
Chemours, which has used GenX instead of PFOA at this European site since 2012, has been permitted to emit the compound GemX into the atmosphere in The Netherlands.
The company's main production site for fluoropolymers in Europe is based in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.

History[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its "performance chemicals" business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[2] DuPont filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called "The Chemours Company".[3] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours' stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[4] Its 180,920,858 shares of common stock were distributed to DuPont shareholders at a par value of one cent each. Chemours has assumed various liabilities arising from lawsuits against DuPont encountered in the normal course of business.[5]
Products[edit]
Chemours manufactures and sells performance chemicals falling within three segments: Titanium Technologies (titanium dioxide); Fluoroproducts (refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives including Freon, Teflon and Viton); and Chemical Solutions (cyanide, sulfuric acid, aniline, methylamines, and reactive metals).

History[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its "performance chemicals" business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[2] DuPont filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called "The Chemours Company".[3] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours' stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[4] Its 180,920,858 shares of common stock were distributed to DuPont shareholders at a par value of one cent each. Chemours has assumed various liabilities arising from lawsuits against DuPont encountered in the normal course of business.[5]
Products[edit]
Chemours manufactures and sells performance chemicals falling within three segments: Titanium Technologies (titanium dioxide); Fluoroproducts (refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives including Freon, Teflon and Viton); and Chemical Solutions (cyanide, sulfuric acid, aniline, methylamines, and reactive metals).

History[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its "performance chemicals" business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[2] DuPont filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called "The Chemours Company".[3] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours' stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[4] Its 180,920,858 shares of common stock were distributed to DuPont shareholders at a par value of one cent each. Chemours has assumed various liabilities arising from lawsuits against DuPont encountered in the normal course of business.[5]
Products[edit]
Chemours manufactures and sells performance chemicals falling within three segments: Titanium Technologies (titanium dioxide); Fluoroproducts (refrigerants and industrial fluoropolymer resins and derivatives including Freon, Teflon and Viton); and Chemical Solutions (cyanide, sulfuric acid, aniline, methylamines, and reactive metals).
