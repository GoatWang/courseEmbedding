[Many families included in these genealogical records had their beginnings in Massachusetts.]



BEAN

The families of Bean, Bain, and Bayne, as the name is variously spelled, are undoubtedly descended from the old Scotch (Scottish!!) clan Vean.  The letters b and v in Gaelic are interchangeable, so that Vean and Bean are the same name differently spelled.  The origin of the name is a matter of conjecture;  by some it is claimed to be derived from the place of residence of the clan, "beann" in Gaelic signifying mountain; but a better supported opinion is that it is derived from the fair complexion of the clan's progenitor, "bean," meaning white or fair, and often used by Highlanders to distinguish a man of fair complexion, as "olive," black or swarthy was used to designate one of dark complexion.  The clan Vean, or, as it is oftener designated in Scotch (Scottish!) history, "MacBean," was one of the tribes of the Chatli, or Clan Chattan, and occupied the Lochaber territory some time before the year 1300.  
Three distinct families of this blood came to America - the Bains settled in Virginia, the Banes in Maine and the Beans in New Hampshire.  In what year or on what ship the progenitor of the Beans reached these shores is not and probably never will be known.

(I)  John Bean, the immigrant ancestor, originally MacBean, or Bayne, was a Scotchman (Scotsman!), said to be the son of Donald MacBayne, and born in Scotland.  There is reason to believe that he was one of the Scotch (Scots!) taken prisoner by Cromwell at the battle of Worcester, or some of the other victories that he won over the Royalist and Scottish forces.  Many thousand of these Scots prisoners were sent over here and in time became proprietors and citizens in good standing with their English neighbors, and many other Scots were drawn to New England to follow relatives who had been sent away.  He first appears as the grantee of land in the town of Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1660.  Other grants were made to him Oct. 10, 1664, April 1, 1671, and Feb. 21, 1708.  John Fed, of Exeter, also conveyed to him, July 22, 1664, land in Exeter, consisting of a house lot of twenty acres, and other lots in Exeter containing ten, five and twenty-six acres respectively.  In 1671 he was one of a committee chosen to run the lines between Exeter and adjoining towns;  he took the oath of allegiance Nov. 30, 1677;  was pound keeper in 1680;  and signed the famous New Hampshire petition of 1680-90.  Tradition, in support of which there is much circumstantial eveidence, says that his wife died on the passage, and that he married a girl who came over on the same vessel.  The name of the first wife is not known.  The name of the second, whom he married before 1661, was Margaret.
Margaret Bean joined Hampton Church in 1671, and good wife Bean was among those who were dismissed from that church in 1698, "in order to their being incorporated unto a church state in Exeter."  Margaret Bean was one of those who organized the church in Exeter, Sept. 2, 1698;  she was a member in 1705, which was the last mention of her.  She died before 1718.  John Bean died between Jan. 24, and Feb. 8, 1717.
He divided his property among his children before his death, and left no will.
Child of 1st wife:
1.  John, born Aug. 15, 1661;  died May 18, 1666.
Children of 2d wife:
2.  Daniel, born March 23, 1662-63.
3.  Samuel, born March 23, 1665-66.
4.  John, born Oct. 13, 1668.
5.  Margaret, born Oct. 27, 1670.
6.  James, born Dec. 17, 1672.
7.  Jeremy, born April 20, 1675.
8.  Elizabeth, born Sept. 24, 1678.

(II)  John (2), fourth son of John (1) and Margaret Bean, was born in Exeter, Oct. 13, 1668, and died in 1718.  He is described in deeds as a carpenter.  He signed the New Hampshire petition of 1690;  witnessed Edward Gilman's will, June 2, 1690;  was one of the witnesses to prove it, April 12, 1692;  and also witnessed two instruments March 15, 1698.  He had a grant of land from the town of sixty acres, March 28, 1698;  his father conveyed to him, as before stated;  also Byley Dudley conveyed to him, May 10, 1700, twenty-five acres of land in Exeter.  He made various conveyances of land and left a comfortable estate to his heirs.
John Bean "stood on his guard" under orders from Dec. 30, 1695 to Jan. 20, 1696;  was on a scouting party two days in 1710;  was in Capt. Gilman's company in 1710, and Capt. James Davis' company in 1712.
His wife's name was Sarah, and after his death she married a Robinson, of Exeter.
Children:
Dinah, Jeremiah, Sarah, William, Ebenezer, Joshua (mentioned below).

(III)  Joshua, youngest son of John (2) and Sarah Bean, was born about 1713 in Exeter, and lived there until 1780, when he removed to Gilmanton, where several of his sons had preceded him, and died in that town in 1787.  Being a Quaker, he refused to sign the association test in 1776, as did his sons, Joshua, Simeon and Gideon.
He married (first) Hannah, daughter of Thomas Robinson.  She died in 1757, and he married (second) 1758, Lydia Brown, born about 1730, died Jan. 21, 1823, in Weare, N. H.  The births of a portion of his children are recorded in Exeter, and others in Brentwood, but it is probable that they were all born upon the same homestead, Brentwood having been cut off from Exeter.
Children:
Hannah, Joshua, Simeon, Sarah, John, Mehitable, Lydia, Gideon, Deborah, Rachel and one who died at birth.

(IV)  Gideon, fourth son of Joshua and Hannah (Robinson) Bean, was born March 21, 1752, in Brentwood, and settled in Gilmanton, where he died Feb. 21, 1823.  
He married (first) Jan. 28, 1777, Margaret Fernald (Cotton), widow of James Folsom.  She was born Oct. 16, 1743, died Oct. 10, 1807.  He married (second) May 4, 1809, a widow, Jane Tibbetts.  She was born Dec. 9, 1753, died Nov. 22, 1837.  The Gilmanton records, like those of most of New Hampshire towns, are very incomplete.  They report the birth of only two children of Gideon Bean by his first wife:
Gideon and Benjamin, born in 1777 and 1780.
There were probably several others.

(V)  Henry, supposed to be a son of Gideon and Margaret F. (Cotton) (Folsom) Bean, was born about 1790, in Gilmanton, and passed his life in that town.  He married Nancy Frohock.
Children:
Chauncey, Marian, Loammi, Henry, Rufus, George, Joel, Catherine (married Cleveland Cheney), and Comfort A.
Loammi, Joel, Rufus and George were soldiers in the war of the rebellion.

(VI)  Joel, youngest son of Henry and Nancy (Frohock) Bean, was born at Meredith, N. H. about 1824, died 1896.  His was an active, useful career.  He began work at the age of fourteen years, and was engaged on the construction of the Boston & Maine railroad (Laconia branch);  later he learned the business connected with the great cotton industry in New England, and for any years was a trusty overseer of some of the largest factories in New England. 
One year after the breaking out of the civil war, Mr. Bean enlisted in the U. S. navy, serving three years;  first as a machinist on the "Mahaska" and later holding the same position on the despatch boat "Bat."  
He married (first) about 1842, Frances A., daughter of Stutson West, of Danville, Vermont.
Children:
1.  Charles B., born 1844, at Meredith, N. H., died in infancy.
2.  Daniel F., born April 22, 1846.
3.  Sarah F., born 1848.
4.   Charles S., born about 1850.

Two children who died in infancy.
Mr. Bean married (second) Lydia J. (Morrill) Ellery, of Hallowell, a widow, who still survives him.
Children:
Allee, Joel, and two who died in infancy.

(VII)  Daniel Frohock, son of Joel and Fances A. (West) Bean, was born at Meredith, N. H., April 22, 1846, receiving a good education in the public schools, so far as he could, up to fourteen years, at which age he went to work in the cotton mills at Portsmouth, N. H., receiving but twenty-five cents a day for his faithful services, and worked full twelve hours a day.  He worked at carding, at first, but worked his way up, through the various branches of the cotton manufacuring industry, being foreman, overseer and superintendent of various mills, in New England and New York.  At present (1908) he fills a position of trust and responsibility as agent for the Farwell Mills, at Lisbon, Maine, which factory employs three hundred persons, and has an output of six million yards of finished dress goods and sheetings each year.  
In April, 1862, he enlisted in the service of the U.S. navy, as wardroom boy on the boat "Mahaska," and on such took part in the battle of Malvern Hill and Charleston, during the bombardment;  also at St. John's River, Florida, and served later as acting steward.  He was convoy to President Lincoln, on a trip from Washington to James river and Richmond.  The "Bat" was considered the swiftest boat in the government's service, and was used in trying to capture J. Wilkes Booth after he had assassinated Pres. Lincoln.  
Mr. Bean is a Mason, having taken all the degrees to and including Knights Templar.  He is also a member of Kora Temple, A.A.O.N.M.S., and member of Pilgrim Fathers.  He is a Republican in politics.
Mr. Bean married, Dec. 25, 1866, Ella, daughter of John and Lucy (Howe) Brown, of Hallowell, Maine.
Children:
1.  Margie, died young.
2.  Ernest, died young.
3.  Lucy J., married Charles R. Seed, of Portsmouth, N. H.

He had a grant of land of thirty acres Feb. 21, 1698, and bought and sold many parcels of land during his life.  A curious order of the general court, dated Oct. 22, 1707, recites that James and Daniel Bean are absent from home in Kingston and ordering them to return.  Perhaps they were needed for defense against the Indians and were away hunting.  Many of the settlers spent much time in the woods getting furs.

(VIII)  Hon. Emery Oliver, son of Oliver Bean, was born in Redfield, Sept. 10, 1819.  His boyhood did not differ materially from that of other children of his time.  A good home, with the self-sacrificing tenderness of a mother's love, united with strict parental discipline, furnished the imeptus of his life of usefulness.  He worked on his father's farm, when in his youthful years.  Besides the district school he attended on term at Kent's Hill Seminary and several terms at Monmouth Academy, acquiring a sound, practical education of great usefulness in his later career and sufficient to stir his ambition to continue his self-education through later years.  He taught school in Mount Vernon and Readfield, Maine, before taking his course in Monmouth Academy.  He had a natural inclination for law as a profession and he began to study in the office of Hon. Timothy O. Howe, of Readfield, according to the usual course in those days.  Mr. Howe was not only an excellent lawyer, but also a natural and gifted teacher, and his pupil enjoyed unusual advantages from the first.  Mr. Bean was admitted to the bar in Aug., 1843, and spent part of his first year in the practice of his profession in the office of Hon. Henry W. Paine at Hallowell.  Then he was admitted to partnerhsip by his former instructor under the firm name of Howe & Bean, and continued to practice until the firm was dissolved in 1848, when Mr. Howe removed to Wisconsin.  For the next twenty-eight years Mr. Bean had no partner.  He enjoyed a large practice and advanced to the front rank of his profession.  In 1876 he admitted his son, Fred Emery Beane, as a partner under the firm name of Bean & Beane, the father and son spelling their names differently.  The firm opened an office in Readfield and in 1890 established another in Hallowell and later one in Gardiner, Maine.  Judge Bean and his firms have had a greater number of cases than any other individual or firm during the years of his practice.  He continued in active practice until his death.
In public life Judge Bean was prominent for many years.  In politics he was a Whig until the party went to pieces, and afterward always a Democrat.  He represented his town in the state legislature in 1851 and was state senator in 1856.  He was appointed trustee of the State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, serving in that office seven years.  In 1880 he was elected probate judge of Kennebec county by a plurality of six hundred on the Democratic ticket, though the county is normally Republican by two or three thousand majority.  He held the office for four years and no appeal from his decisions was sustained in the supreme court in probate cases and only one in insolvency proceedings.  
Almost every year after he came of age, Judge Bean was elected to some office of trust and responsibility in his town, and he was especially active in educational matters.  The time and value of his public services given without compensation can hardly be estimated.  He was for fifty years a Free Mason.  In religion he was a faithful member of the Universalist church.  For more than forty years he was superintendent of the Sunday school.  "Many young people," writes a friend, "have gone out from the little vestry, after a period of years as scholars there, and have built homes in other states and among other people, but still their hearts turn lovingly and gratefully back to the early days, the little school and the principles inculcated therein."
A home-loving man, his heart does not wander from the lifelong scenes, but becomes more closely attached as time rolls on.  His loving friends watch, with admiration, the activity which yet is his, and trust that the day is far distant when he shall go out and in no more.  The same writer said, "The little cottage at Readfield, one-half mile from his childhood's home, where so many years of his life have been spent, and endeared to him by its associations, this, with it surroundings is one of the most attracrive home in town, speaking well for the loving care of its inmates."
Judge Bean married, Oct. 8, 1844, Elizabeth Hunton Craig, of Readfield, born April 18, 1818, died Jan. 22, 1892, daughter of John Orison and Sally (Turner) Craig.  He married (second) June 28, 1896, Georgianna Caroline (Packard) Nickerson, born in Readfield March 24, 1844, widow of Hezekiah Owen Nickerson, dau. of James and Sophronia (Clough) Packard. 
Children of 1st wife, b. Readfield:
1.  Nelson Shepard, born July 18, 1845, married July 7, 1869, Ella Frances Blanchard, b. April 13, 1848, died April 1900, dau. of Sidney and Cordelia M. (Galloupe) Blanchard; no children.
2.  Fred Emery, born May 14, 1853, mentioned below.
Judge Bean died Dec. 13, 1904.

(IX)  Hon. Fred Emery Beane, son of Emery Oliver Bean, was born at Readfield, May 14, 1853.

(VII)  George Washington, son of Levi (2) Bean, was born June 18, 1837, in Concord, N. H., and secured a somewhat limited education there and in the adjoining town of Loudon.  At an early age he went to Manchester, N. H., arriving there with forty-five cents in his pockets.  Obtaining a position in a cotton mill, he used the forty-five cnts to purchase a pair of blue overalls, and for some time worked for the princely salary of three dollars a week.  His board cost two and a half dollars per week and by the strictest economy he manged to purchase the raiment necessary to wear while at work.  At the beginning of the second year, his salary was raised to the amount of sixteen and two-thirds cents per day, and in the third year he received eighty-five cents per day.  Having learned his trade, he now received a journeyman's wages, one dollar and a quarter per day, and on a salary of eight dollars per week, he took a wife.  Soon after he received an offer from the Stark Mills in Manchester, N. H., which he accepted, and continued with that establishment for a period of five years.  At the end of this time he received a flattering offer from the Androscoggin Mill as overseer, and for seven years was identified therewith.  His thorough knowledge of every detail in the manufacturing of cotton goods, together with executive ability of a high order, attracted the attention of the management of the Great Falls Mills, Great Falls, N. H., and he acted as superintendent four years,, and later was with the  Merchants' Mill of Fall River.  July 8, 1886, he was offered the position of agent of the Androscoggin Mill, Lewiston, Maine, a position which few men could successfully fill.  Since that year, the mill has experienced a steady and healthy growth until it now stands among the first in the state, employing eleven hundred operatives with a semi-monthly pay roll of eighteen thousand dollars.
In 1872 Mr. Bean became a charter member of the National Cotton Manufacturers' Association.  He was also one of the organizers of the Lewiston Manufacturers' and Mechanics' Association.

In 1856 he married Sophronia A., daughter of Bliss Corliss, of East Corinth, Vermont, and they became the parents of three children, all of whom are now deceased:
Charles, George and William.
BEAN

A branch of the Bean family (see preceding sketches) is descended from Lewis Bane, but no records have been found which exactly settle the date of his immigration or the place where he landed.  A large number of early settlers of York were Scotch (Scottish!) and came direct from the old country.  A section of York was locally known as Scotland, and the name still clings to it.  
The son of Lewis, in a legal document signed by him speaks of his father as "Lewis Bane, Gent., formerly of Scotland," and a family record of one of the granddaughters, Mary Bean, who married Hugh Barbour, of Falmouth, says that she was an ardent Stuart sympathizer, having received that feeling from her father's teachings.  
March 5, 1668, Lewis Bane was granted a "lott of land" by the selectmen of York for a homestead.  His name was indifferently spelled Bane and Bean, in the early records, but by the time of the second generation the spelling settled into Bean.
Lewis married Mary Mills, and had five children.
He died about 1677, and his widow married a Mr. Brissome for a second husband; she died about 1694, leaving no issue by her second husband.
Children of Lewis and Mary were:
Lewis, Ebenezer, Joseph, James and Elizabeth.

(II)  Captain Lewis (2), eldest son of Lewis (1) and Mary (Mills) Bean or Bane, was born April 28, 1671, and died June 25, 1721.  He resided on the homestead of his father, and at his death gave it to his son John.  He owned timber lands in both York and Wells, and was one of the proprietors of a sawmill in York.  As measured by the standard of those days in York, he was a man of wealth.  The York records contain copies of many deeds wherein he was grantor or grantee of lands.  He was one of the most influential men of York in his day.  He was justice of the peace for many years;  served on the grand jury many times;  was selectman many years;  was delegate to the general court at Boston;  was one of the commissioners appointed by the Colonial authorities to lay out and define the boundaries of the townships as far east as Falmouth;  was one of the commissioners who had charge of building the forts and blockhouses for defense against the Indians;  and was a captain in the militia which in those days meant a call at any moment to defend the settlements from the Indian attacks.
Capt. Bean married, 1691, Mrs. Mary (Austen) Sayward, daughter of Matthew and Mary (Davis) Austen, and widow of Jonathan Sayward, of York.
Children:
Jonathan, Mary, Lewis, John, Elinor, Mehitable and Ebenezer.

(III)  Capt. Jonathan, eldest of the children of Capt. Lewis (2) and Mary (Austen) (Sayward) Bean, was born Dec. 14, 1692, and died Dec. 6, 1777.  He was a farmer and lumberman, being part owner of a sawmill in York.  In 1745 the colony raised a force of four hundred and fifty men to protect the frontier from Berwick to Rockland.  Jonathan Bean was commissioned captain and put in command of the garrisons from the Piscataqua to the Presumpscot rivers, with headquarters at the Saco blockhouse on the west bank of the Saco river in what is now the town of Dayton.  He was graned seven hundred acres of land at the blockhouse, and lived there until after the dismantling of the fort in 1759, when he returned to York.  As was the custom in those days the men of the garrison were engaged in faming and other pursuits when not called upon to fight, and Jonathan's children settled around the blockhouse where their descendants live today.
He was also one of the original proprietors of the town of Sullivan, Maine, his share passing to his son Nehemiah.  He was a leading citizen of his time in both civil and military affairs, and at his death had a goodly estate to pass down to his family. 
He married, in 1717, Sarah Nowell, daughter of Peter and Sarah (Weare) Nowell, of York.  
Children:
Jonathan, Daniel, Mary, Sarah, Joshua, Mercy, Huldah, Abraham, Ebenezer, Nehemiah and Charles.

(IV)  Ebenezer, ninth child and fifth son of Capt. Jonathan and Sarah (Nowell) Bean, was born in York June 20, 1737, and died in Limerick, Sept., 1824.  He was a farmer near the blockhouse.  In April, 1776, he enlisted in Capt. Lane's company, in Col. James M. Varnum's regiment of the Continental line and served one year.  For this service he received a pension in later life.  During his last years he and his wife lived with their son Charles in Limerick, and are buried in the private cemetery on the farm near Emery Corner.
He married, in Buxton, June 27, 1766, Elizabeth Thomas, daughter of a member of the garrison forces at the blockhouse.
Children, order of birth now known:
Charles, Mariam, Daniel, David and Lydia.

(V)  Charles, son of Ebenezer and Elizabeth (Thomas) Bean, was born at the blockhouse Jan. 5, 1767, and died in Limerick, June 29, 1847.  As a boy he lived with a Daniel Moulton, of Scarboro.  When a young man he went to Machias and worked in a sawmill.  He then returned to Scarboro and bought of Daniel Moulton a one hundred acre lot of land (more or less) in what was then a wilderness, now the town of Limerick;  for this he paid "50 Spanish milled dollars," and started to find his claim.  The road beyond Gorham was a blazed trail.  He located his land, started a clearing, put in a crop, built a cabin for his family and a hovel for his cow, and went back after his wife and baby, and in this primitive way, like many others, he started to make a living for his family.  The log cabin was replaced with a frame house, the hovel by a large barn which stands today (1908), and here they raised a large family, and as his children married he had the means to help each of them to acquire a homestead of his own.  In these later days the farm in unoccupied, as the last owner could not get a living where Charles got a competence. 
He married, in Scarboro, June 10, 1790, Sally Cotton, daughter of Nathaniel and Hannah (Elkins) (Beck) Cotton, of Portsmouth, N. H.  He and Sally were Quakers, and not content with the task of bringing up their own fourteen children, they took into their family and brought up three of the children of their neighbors.
Children:
Catherine, Daniel, Nathaniel, Eli, David, Mary, Sally, Cotton, Hannah Elkins, Eliza Thomas, Charles and Sylvanus (twins), Ruhamah and Nancy.
Charles married, 1833, for a second wife, Mrs. Abigial (Harper) Watson.  There were no children of this marriage.

(VI)  Cotton, eighth child and fifth son of Charles and Sally (Cotton) Bean, was born in Limerick, Maine, March 6, 1804, and died May 8, 1868.  He was one of the foremost men of his town.  He was one of the many-sided men who being devolved by the needs of the times built up old New England.  He started in life as a farmer,  living first on the ancestral acres, then moving to a large farm at Emery Corner.  In 1853 he sold his farm and moved to Limerick Village.  He was one of the principal master builders when it was the custom to frame a building on the site it was to occupy, using timber enough in the frame to construct a modern building, and then raise it by the united strength of all the assembled townsmen;  he was also a master dam builder and stone mason.  After moving to the village he engaged in the business of wheelwright, and as a diversion repaired watches and clocks.  He was justice of the peace for many years, and filled other town offices.  Upon the founding of the Republican party, he became very active locally in that organization, and was a member of the first board of county commissioners for York county, elected by the Republicans.  
He was a Free Baptist in religious convictions, and was active in all that helped to contribute to the good of the town and state.
He married, in Limerick, Dec. 7, 1828, Mehitable Brackett, daughter of Isaac and Margaret (Ricker) Brackett, of Limerick.
Children:
Isaac Brackett, Charles, Albion, Cyrus E., Ivory Small (see below).

(VII)  Ivory Small, youngest child of Cotton and Mehitable (Brackett) Bean, was born in Limerick, Oct. 17, 1841, and died in Portland Jan. 14, 1905.  He was educated at the Limerick Academy and Lewiston Seminary, now Bates College.  In the early sixties he went to Portland and entered the wholesale grocery trade.  In 1872 he engaged in the wholesale fruit and produce business, and at his death was the leading merchant in his line, and in point of years the oldest in Portland.
He was a member of the Board of Trade, Portland Fruit and Produce Exchange, and Boston Fruit and Produce Exchange.  He was also a member of Ligonia Lodge, I.O.O.F., Ivanhoe Lodge, Knights of Pythias, and of the Portland Club.  In political affiliations he was a Republican.
He married (first) in Thorndike, Feb. 14, 1865, Felicia Hemans Shaw, who was born April 3, 1841, and died May 6, 1869, dau. of Dr. Albert and Eliza (Drew) Shaw.
Child:
Charles Addison, mentioned below.
He married (second) July 30, 1877, Mrs. Delia (Rice) Warren, who died Oct. 17, 1880;  (third) Nov. 14, 1894, Ellen Appleton Knowlton, of Hamilton, Mass., dau. of Ira P. and Esther (Appleton) Knowlton, who survives him.

(VIII)  Charles Addison, only child of Ivory Small and Felicia H. (Shaw) Bean, was born in Portland, Jan. 21, 1866.  He was educated in the public schools of Portland, entered the employ of his father in 1884, and in 1892 became the junior member of the firm of  I.S. Bean & Company.  Upon the death of Ivory S. Bean the company was incorporated, and the junior member of the old firm became president and general manager of the I. S. Bean Company, which under his charge is a flourishing concern.
He is a member of Trinity Church, Episcopal, at Woodford's;  is a Republican in party affiliation, and has served two years as councilman in the city government.  He is a member of the Board of Trade, Portland Fruit and Produce Exchange.
At the age of seventeen years he became a member of the militia of the state and served five years, in what is now Company B, First Regiment.  Mr. Bean is a constant student of good literature, takes much interest in his ancestry, nearly thirty lines of which he has traced to the immigrant ancestor, and is a member of the Maine Historical Society, the Maine Genealogical Society, and the Sons of the American Revolution.  He is also a member of Deering Lodge of Masons, Hadattah Lodge of Odd Fellows, Bramhall Lodge, Knights of Pythias, the Deering Club, the Portland Club, the Diocesan Church Club, of Maine, and many others.  He is one of the best known and best liked of the younger generation of Portland business men.

As general manager

Oakland Athletics (1998–2016)




William Lamar Beane III (born March 29, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player and current front office executive. He is the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and minority owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to his front office career, he played in MLB as an outfielder between 1984 and 1989 for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. He joined the Athletics front office as a scout in 1990. He was named general manager after the 1997 season, and promoted to executive vice president after the 2015 season.
A first round pick in the MLB draft by the Mets, Beane's playing career failed to meet the expectations of scouts, who projected him as a star. In his front office career, Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) to players, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. He is the subject of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on baseball economics, Moneyball, which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.

Baseball career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Beane grew up in Mayport, Florida and San Diego, California, the child of a career military family.[1][2] His father, a naval officer, taught him how to pitch.[1]
Beane attended Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego, where he excelled at baseball, football, and basketball.[1] The high school coach added Beane to the varsity baseball team for the last game of his freshman season.[1] Beane batted .501 during his sophomore and junior years of high school.[1][3] In his senior season, his batting average dropped to .300.[4]
Despite the decrease in batting average, scouts were enamored with Beane's talent.[4] Beane gave up football to avoid an injury that could prematurely end his baseball career.[5] Despite this, Stanford University tried to recruit Beane on a joint baseball–football scholarship as the quarterback who would replace then-sophomore John Elway for the Stanford Cardinal football team.[5]
Playing career[edit]
The New York Mets, who had the first overall selection of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, were enamored with Beane's talent and considered choosing him with the first pick.[6] Because many teams believed Beane would attend Stanford and not sign with a professional team,[7] Beane fell to the 23rd pick, where he was taken by the Mets, who had two other first round picks that year, allowing them to risk Beane not signing.[8] After visiting the Mets clubhouse, Beane decided to sign with the Mets for a $125,000 signing bonus ($363,338 in current dollar terms). Beane notes his decision to sign with the Mets instead of going to Stanford as the "only decision he would ever make in his life about money."[9]
Believing Beane to be a more refined player than their top first-round pick, Darryl Strawberry, the Mets assigned Strawberry to play rookie ball with other high school draftees, while Beane was assigned to the Little Falls Mets of the Class A New York–Penn League, with players drafted out of college.[10] Beane struggled in his first season, batting .210.[11] He was unable to make the adjustments that were necessary when playing tougher competition. The Mets promoted Beane to the Lynchburg Mets of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 1981. After a solid season, he was promoted to the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League in 1982.[11] While Strawberry was the league's most valuable player, Beane batted .220.[12] Beane began questioning himself, while his new roommate, Lenny Dykstra, succeeded with unwavering confidence and superior mental focus.[13]

Beane remained in Jackson until 1984, when he received his first promotion to MLB, appearing in five games for the 1984 New York Mets. In 1985, Beane spent most of the season with the Tidewater Tides of the Class AAA International League, getting called up to the 1985 Mets for eight games. He batted .284 for the Tides in 1985, leading the team with 19 home runs and 77 runs batted in.[14] Following the season, the Mets traded Beane with Joe Klink and Bill Latham to the Minnesota Twins for Tim Teufel and Pat Crosby, a minor league player.[15]
The Twins entered spring training prepared to give Beane the job as their starting left fielder over incumbent Mickey Hatcher, but he dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness.[16] Beane appeared in 80 games for the 1986 Minnesota Twins, batting .216.[17] Beane also appeared in 32 games for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Twins sent Beane to their new Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), after spring training in 1987.[18] After batting .285 for Portland, Beane received a call-up to the Twins after the September 1 roster expansion.[17][19] He appeared in 12 games for the 1987 Minnesota Twins.
The Twins traded Beane to the Detroit Tigers for Balvino Gálvez during spring training in 1988.[20] He made the Tigers opening day roster that season as an injury fill-in,[21] and was optioned to Toledo in late April,[22] now serving as Detroit's Class-AAA affiliate, where he spent most of the season. During this time, he played in the same outfield as another player with nearly the same name – Billy Bean – and he also had a teammate with the name Rice.[23] Beane appeared in six games for the 1988 Tigers. Granted free agency after the 1988 season, Beane signed with the Oakland Athletics, appearing in 37 games with the 1989 Athletics, batting .241 in 79 at bats.[24] Beane spent most of the season with the Class-AAA Tacoma Tigers of the PCL. He re-signed with the Athletics for the 1990 season,[24] and he was sent down to the minor leagues at the end of spring training.[25]
Front office career[edit]
Weary of the lifestyle of a minor league player, Beane approached Athletics GM Sandy Alderson a day after he was reassigned to minor league camp in April 1990 and asked for a job as an advance scout.[26][27] Beane held this position through 1993, when he was promoted to assistant GM of the Athletics, tasked with scouting minor league players.[28][29]
Under the ownership of Walter A. Haas, Jr., the Athletics appeared in three consecutive World Series, from 1988 through 1990, and had the highest payroll in baseball in 1991.[30] Haas died in 1995, and new owners Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann ordered Alderson to slash payroll.[31] To field a competitive roster on a limited budget, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles, to obtain relatively undervalued players. He valued on-base percentage among hitters.[32] Alderson taught Beane to find value that other teams did not see using sabermetrics.[33]
Beane succeeded Alderson as GM on October 17, 1997.[34] He continued Alderson's crafting of the Athletics into one of the most cost-effective teams in baseball. For example, in the 2006 MLB season, the Athletics ranked 24th of 30 major league teams in player salaries but had the 5th-best regular-season record.[35]

The Athletics reached the playoffs in four consecutive years from 2000 through 2003, losing in the American League Division Series each year. In 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100 plus years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games. They won their first playoff series under Beane in 2006 when they swept the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, but were subsequently swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series. Other low payroll teams, such as the 2003 World Champion Florida Marlins and the 2008 American League Champion Tampa Bay Rays, have appeared in the World Series, with the former going on to win the World Series in 2003.


It's all about evaluating skills and putting a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k) has a choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which way I'd choose."

–Billy Beane[36]
After the 2002 season, the Boston Red Sox made Beane an offer of $12,500,000 to become their GM,[33] but he declined.[37] On April 15, 2005, Beane received a contract extension to remain with the Athletics as its general manager through 2012, and new team owner Lewis Wolff awarded Beane a small portion of the team's ownership.[38] In February 2012, the Athletics extended Beane's contract through 2019.[39]
From their 2006 playoff appearance until 2012 when they again made the playoffs, the Athletics had not made the playoffs or finished above .500, which had triggered criticism of Beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball, especially in 2009.[36] Beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach, indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis.[36] Many other general managers have followed Beane's strategy and now use similar approaches.[40]
The book itself has changed the way different players are valued, and Beane began concentrating on high school players, a group he once largely ignored, in the MLB draft, considering them to be heavily undervalued.[36] He and other like-minded GMs also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills, which had become undervalued in the years immediately after the Moneyball revolution. This new emphasis on defense was displayed in the 2010 season; although the Athletics finished at .500 and again missed the playoffs, they led MLB in defensive efficiency, measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs, and allowed the fewest runs in the AL.[41] In the 2012 season the Athletics again made the playoffs under Beane winning the American League West title on the last day of the regular season. The Athletics returned to the playoffs in 2013 by also winning the American League West division title in the 2013 season, the team's first back-to-back division championships since the 2002–2003 seasons.
In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Beane as number 10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade in all sports.[42][a]
On October 5, 2015, the Oakland Athletics announced that Beane had been promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations. Assistant GM David Forst assumed the job of general manager.[43]
Activities outside baseball[edit]
Soccer[edit]
When the Athletics ownership group agreed to purchase the reincarnation of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, Beane, who has expressed a passion for soccer, began developing a system for objectively analyzing soccer players. He has agreed to help the Earthquakes front office develop a method for building a cost-effective team, as the salary cap in MLS is even more restrictive than the Athletics status as a small-market team in Major League Baseball.[44] However, a system has yet to be implemented.
Beane has claimed that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is a personal idol. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football.[45]
In March 2015, the Dutch football club AZ Alkmaar, under general director Robert Eenhoorn, a former Major Leaguer, hired Beane as an advisor.[46]
Software industry[edit]
On January 4, 2007, the software company NetSuite named Beane to its board of directors. NetSuite co-founder Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[47] Beane also served as a consultant for, and also appears in, the video game MLB Front Office Manager.[48][49]
Depiction in book and film Moneyball[edit]
Because of his team's success despite its low payroll, Beane was the subject of author Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The book discusses Beane's methods as the GM of the Athletics and how he, along with Harvard-educated statistician Paul DePodesta,[50] used sabermetric principles to run his team in a cost-effective way. According to the book, this allowed him to be successful despite his financial constraints. The book and Beane's methods have influenced the way many think about the game of baseball, including other teams and players.[51] Brad Pitt played the role of Beane in the 2011 film Moneyball.[36] Pitt was nominated for the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance.
Personal life[edit]
Twice married, Beane has a daughter Casey from his first marriage and twins Brayden and Tinsley from his current marriage.[36][52] He attended the University of California, San Diego during the baseball offseasons of his playing career.[53]

As general manager

Oakland Athletics (1998–2016)




William Lamar Beane III (born March 29, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player and current front office executive. He is the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and minority owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to his front office career, he played in MLB as an outfielder between 1984 and 1989 for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. He joined the Athletics front office as a scout in 1990. He was named general manager after the 1997 season, and promoted to executive vice president after the 2015 season.
A first round pick in the MLB draft by the Mets, Beane's playing career failed to meet the expectations of scouts, who projected him as a star. In his front office career, Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) to players, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. He is the subject of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on baseball economics, Moneyball, which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.

Baseball career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Beane grew up in Mayport, Florida and San Diego, California, the child of a career military family.[1][2] His father, a naval officer, taught him how to pitch.[1]
Beane attended Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego, where he excelled at baseball, football, and basketball.[1] The high school coach added Beane to the varsity baseball team for the last game of his freshman season.[1] Beane batted .501 during his sophomore and junior years of high school.[1][3] In his senior season, his batting average dropped to .300.[4]
Despite the decrease in batting average, scouts were enamored with Beane's talent.[4] Beane gave up football to avoid an injury that could prematurely end his baseball career.[5] Despite this, Stanford University tried to recruit Beane on a joint baseball–football scholarship as the quarterback who would replace then-sophomore John Elway for the Stanford Cardinal football team.[5]
Playing career[edit]
The New York Mets, who had the first overall selection of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, were enamored with Beane's talent and considered choosing him with the first pick.[6] Because many teams believed Beane would attend Stanford and not sign with a professional team,[7] Beane fell to the 23rd pick, where he was taken by the Mets, who had two other first round picks that year, allowing them to risk Beane not signing.[8] After visiting the Mets clubhouse, Beane decided to sign with the Mets for a $125,000 signing bonus ($363,338 in current dollar terms). Beane notes his decision to sign with the Mets instead of going to Stanford as the "only decision he would ever make in his life about money."[9]
Believing Beane to be a more refined player than their top first-round pick, Darryl Strawberry, the Mets assigned Strawberry to play rookie ball with other high school draftees, while Beane was assigned to the Little Falls Mets of the Class A New York–Penn League, with players drafted out of college.[10] Beane struggled in his first season, batting .210.[11] He was unable to make the adjustments that were necessary when playing tougher competition. The Mets promoted Beane to the Lynchburg Mets of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 1981. After a solid season, he was promoted to the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League in 1982.[11] While Strawberry was the league's most valuable player, Beane batted .220.[12] Beane began questioning himself, while his new roommate, Lenny Dykstra, succeeded with unwavering confidence and superior mental focus.[13]

Beane remained in Jackson until 1984, when he received his first promotion to MLB, appearing in five games for the 1984 New York Mets. In 1985, Beane spent most of the season with the Tidewater Tides of the Class AAA International League, getting called up to the 1985 Mets for eight games. He batted .284 for the Tides in 1985, leading the team with 19 home runs and 77 runs batted in.[14] Following the season, the Mets traded Beane with Joe Klink and Bill Latham to the Minnesota Twins for Tim Teufel and Pat Crosby, a minor league player.[15]
The Twins entered spring training prepared to give Beane the job as their starting left fielder over incumbent Mickey Hatcher, but he dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness.[16] Beane appeared in 80 games for the 1986 Minnesota Twins, batting .216.[17] Beane also appeared in 32 games for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Twins sent Beane to their new Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), after spring training in 1987.[18] After batting .285 for Portland, Beane received a call-up to the Twins after the September 1 roster expansion.[17][19] He appeared in 12 games for the 1987 Minnesota Twins.
The Twins traded Beane to the Detroit Tigers for Balvino Gálvez during spring training in 1988.[20] He made the Tigers opening day roster that season as an injury fill-in,[21] and was optioned to Toledo in late April,[22] now serving as Detroit's Class-AAA affiliate, where he spent most of the season. During this time, he played in the same outfield as another player with nearly the same name – Billy Bean – and he also had a teammate with the name Rice.[23] Beane appeared in six games for the 1988 Tigers. Granted free agency after the 1988 season, Beane signed with the Oakland Athletics, appearing in 37 games with the 1989 Athletics, batting .241 in 79 at bats.[24] Beane spent most of the season with the Class-AAA Tacoma Tigers of the PCL. He re-signed with the Athletics for the 1990 season,[24] and he was sent down to the minor leagues at the end of spring training.[25]
Front office career[edit]
Weary of the lifestyle of a minor league player, Beane approached Athletics GM Sandy Alderson a day after he was reassigned to minor league camp in April 1990 and asked for a job as an advance scout.[26][27] Beane held this position through 1993, when he was promoted to assistant GM of the Athletics, tasked with scouting minor league players.[28][29]
Under the ownership of Walter A. Haas, Jr., the Athletics appeared in three consecutive World Series, from 1988 through 1990, and had the highest payroll in baseball in 1991.[30] Haas died in 1995, and new owners Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann ordered Alderson to slash payroll.[31] To field a competitive roster on a limited budget, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles, to obtain relatively undervalued players. He valued on-base percentage among hitters.[32] Alderson taught Beane to find value that other teams did not see using sabermetrics.[33]
Beane succeeded Alderson as GM on October 17, 1997.[34] He continued Alderson's crafting of the Athletics into one of the most cost-effective teams in baseball. For example, in the 2006 MLB season, the Athletics ranked 24th of 30 major league teams in player salaries but had the 5th-best regular-season record.[35]

The Athletics reached the playoffs in four consecutive years from 2000 through 2003, losing in the American League Division Series each year. In 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100 plus years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games. They won their first playoff series under Beane in 2006 when they swept the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, but were subsequently swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series. Other low payroll teams, such as the 2003 World Champion Florida Marlins and the 2008 American League Champion Tampa Bay Rays, have appeared in the World Series, with the former going on to win the World Series in 2003.


It's all about evaluating skills and putting a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k) has a choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which way I'd choose."

–Billy Beane[36]
After the 2002 season, the Boston Red Sox made Beane an offer of $12,500,000 to become their GM,[33] but he declined.[37] On April 15, 2005, Beane received a contract extension to remain with the Athletics as its general manager through 2012, and new team owner Lewis Wolff awarded Beane a small portion of the team's ownership.[38] In February 2012, the Athletics extended Beane's contract through 2019.[39]
From their 2006 playoff appearance until 2012 when they again made the playoffs, the Athletics had not made the playoffs or finished above .500, which had triggered criticism of Beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball, especially in 2009.[36] Beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach, indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis.[36] Many other general managers have followed Beane's strategy and now use similar approaches.[40]
The book itself has changed the way different players are valued, and Beane began concentrating on high school players, a group he once largely ignored, in the MLB draft, considering them to be heavily undervalued.[36] He and other like-minded GMs also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills, which had become undervalued in the years immediately after the Moneyball revolution. This new emphasis on defense was displayed in the 2010 season; although the Athletics finished at .500 and again missed the playoffs, they led MLB in defensive efficiency, measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs, and allowed the fewest runs in the AL.[41] In the 2012 season the Athletics again made the playoffs under Beane winning the American League West title on the last day of the regular season. The Athletics returned to the playoffs in 2013 by also winning the American League West division title in the 2013 season, the team's first back-to-back division championships since the 2002–2003 seasons.
In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Beane as number 10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade in all sports.[42][a]
On October 5, 2015, the Oakland Athletics announced that Beane had been promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations. Assistant GM David Forst assumed the job of general manager.[43]
Activities outside baseball[edit]
Soccer[edit]
When the Athletics ownership group agreed to purchase the reincarnation of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, Beane, who has expressed a passion for soccer, began developing a system for objectively analyzing soccer players. He has agreed to help the Earthquakes front office develop a method for building a cost-effective team, as the salary cap in MLS is even more restrictive than the Athletics status as a small-market team in Major League Baseball.[44] However, a system has yet to be implemented.
Beane has claimed that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is a personal idol. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football.[45]
In March 2015, the Dutch football club AZ Alkmaar, under general director Robert Eenhoorn, a former Major Leaguer, hired Beane as an advisor.[46]
Software industry[edit]
On January 4, 2007, the software company NetSuite named Beane to its board of directors. NetSuite co-founder Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[47] Beane also served as a consultant for, and also appears in, the video game MLB Front Office Manager.[48][49]
Depiction in book and film Moneyball[edit]
Because of his team's success despite its low payroll, Beane was the subject of author Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The book discusses Beane's methods as the GM of the Athletics and how he, along with Harvard-educated statistician Paul DePodesta,[50] used sabermetric principles to run his team in a cost-effective way. According to the book, this allowed him to be successful despite his financial constraints. The book and Beane's methods have influenced the way many think about the game of baseball, including other teams and players.[51] Brad Pitt played the role of Beane in the 2011 film Moneyball.[36] Pitt was nominated for the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance.
Personal life[edit]
Twice married, Beane has a daughter Casey from his first marriage and twins Brayden and Tinsley from his current marriage.[36][52] He attended the University of California, San Diego during the baseball offseasons of his playing career.[53]

As general manager

Oakland Athletics (1998–2016)




William Lamar Beane III (born March 29, 1962) is an American former professional baseball player and current front office executive. He is the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations and minority owner of the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). Prior to his front office career, he played in MLB as an outfielder between 1984 and 1989 for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Detroit Tigers, and Oakland Athletics. He joined the Athletics front office as a scout in 1990. He was named general manager after the 1997 season, and promoted to executive vice president after the 2015 season.
A first round pick in the MLB draft by the Mets, Beane's playing career failed to meet the expectations of scouts, who projected him as a star. In his front office career, Beane has applied statistical analysis (known as sabermetrics) to players, which has led teams to reconsider how they evaluate players. He is the subject of Michael Lewis' 2003 book on baseball economics, Moneyball, which was made into a 2011 film starring Brad Pitt as Beane.

Baseball career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Beane grew up in Mayport, Florida and San Diego, California, the child of a career military family.[1][2] His father, a naval officer, taught him how to pitch.[1]
Beane attended Mt. Carmel High School in San Diego, where he excelled at baseball, football, and basketball.[1] The high school coach added Beane to the varsity baseball team for the last game of his freshman season.[1] Beane batted .501 during his sophomore and junior years of high school.[1][3] In his senior season, his batting average dropped to .300.[4]
Despite the decrease in batting average, scouts were enamored with Beane's talent.[4] Beane gave up football to avoid an injury that could prematurely end his baseball career.[5] Despite this, Stanford University tried to recruit Beane on a joint baseball–football scholarship as the quarterback who would replace then-sophomore John Elway for the Stanford Cardinal football team.[5]
Playing career[edit]
The New York Mets, who had the first overall selection of the 1980 Major League Baseball Draft, were enamored with Beane's talent and considered choosing him with the first pick.[6] Because many teams believed Beane would attend Stanford and not sign with a professional team,[7] Beane fell to the 23rd pick, where he was taken by the Mets, who had two other first round picks that year, allowing them to risk Beane not signing.[8] After visiting the Mets clubhouse, Beane decided to sign with the Mets for a $125,000 signing bonus ($363,338 in current dollar terms). Beane notes his decision to sign with the Mets instead of going to Stanford as the "only decision he would ever make in his life about money."[9]
Believing Beane to be a more refined player than their top first-round pick, Darryl Strawberry, the Mets assigned Strawberry to play rookie ball with other high school draftees, while Beane was assigned to the Little Falls Mets of the Class A New York–Penn League, with players drafted out of college.[10] Beane struggled in his first season, batting .210.[11] He was unable to make the adjustments that were necessary when playing tougher competition. The Mets promoted Beane to the Lynchburg Mets of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League in 1981. After a solid season, he was promoted to the Jackson Mets of the Class AA Texas League in 1982.[11] While Strawberry was the league's most valuable player, Beane batted .220.[12] Beane began questioning himself, while his new roommate, Lenny Dykstra, succeeded with unwavering confidence and superior mental focus.[13]

Beane remained in Jackson until 1984, when he received his first promotion to MLB, appearing in five games for the 1984 New York Mets. In 1985, Beane spent most of the season with the Tidewater Tides of the Class AAA International League, getting called up to the 1985 Mets for eight games. He batted .284 for the Tides in 1985, leading the team with 19 home runs and 77 runs batted in.[14] Following the season, the Mets traded Beane with Joe Klink and Bill Latham to the Minnesota Twins for Tim Teufel and Pat Crosby, a minor league player.[15]
The Twins entered spring training prepared to give Beane the job as their starting left fielder over incumbent Mickey Hatcher, but he dealt with injuries and ineffectiveness.[16] Beane appeared in 80 games for the 1986 Minnesota Twins, batting .216.[17] Beane also appeared in 32 games for the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. The Twins sent Beane to their new Class-AAA affiliate, the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), after spring training in 1987.[18] After batting .285 for Portland, Beane received a call-up to the Twins after the September 1 roster expansion.[17][19] He appeared in 12 games for the 1987 Minnesota Twins.
The Twins traded Beane to the Detroit Tigers for Balvino Gálvez during spring training in 1988.[20] He made the Tigers opening day roster that season as an injury fill-in,[21] and was optioned to Toledo in late April,[22] now serving as Detroit's Class-AAA affiliate, where he spent most of the season. During this time, he played in the same outfield as another player with nearly the same name – Billy Bean – and he also had a teammate with the name Rice.[23] Beane appeared in six games for the 1988 Tigers. Granted free agency after the 1988 season, Beane signed with the Oakland Athletics, appearing in 37 games with the 1989 Athletics, batting .241 in 79 at bats.[24] Beane spent most of the season with the Class-AAA Tacoma Tigers of the PCL. He re-signed with the Athletics for the 1990 season,[24] and he was sent down to the minor leagues at the end of spring training.[25]
Front office career[edit]
Weary of the lifestyle of a minor league player, Beane approached Athletics GM Sandy Alderson a day after he was reassigned to minor league camp in April 1990 and asked for a job as an advance scout.[26][27] Beane held this position through 1993, when he was promoted to assistant GM of the Athletics, tasked with scouting minor league players.[28][29]
Under the ownership of Walter A. Haas, Jr., the Athletics appeared in three consecutive World Series, from 1988 through 1990, and had the highest payroll in baseball in 1991.[30] Haas died in 1995, and new owners Stephen Schott and Ken Hofmann ordered Alderson to slash payroll.[31] To field a competitive roster on a limited budget, Alderson began focusing on sabermetric principles, to obtain relatively undervalued players. He valued on-base percentage among hitters.[32] Alderson taught Beane to find value that other teams did not see using sabermetrics.[33]
Beane succeeded Alderson as GM on October 17, 1997.[34] He continued Alderson's crafting of the Athletics into one of the most cost-effective teams in baseball. For example, in the 2006 MLB season, the Athletics ranked 24th of 30 major league teams in player salaries but had the 5th-best regular-season record.[35]

The Athletics reached the playoffs in four consecutive years from 2000 through 2003, losing in the American League Division Series each year. In 2002, the Athletics became the first team in the 100 plus years of American League baseball to win 20 consecutive games. They won their first playoff series under Beane in 2006 when they swept the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, but were subsequently swept by the Detroit Tigers in the American League Championship Series. Other low payroll teams, such as the 2003 World Champion Florida Marlins and the 2008 American League Champion Tampa Bay Rays, have appeared in the World Series, with the former going on to win the World Series in 2003.


It's all about evaluating skills and putting a price on them. Thirty years ago, stockbrokers used to buy stock strictly by feel. Let's put it this way: Anyone in the game with a 401(k) has a choice. They can choose a fund manager who manages their retirement by gut instinct, or one who chooses by research and analysis. I know which way I'd choose."

–Billy Beane[36]
After the 2002 season, the Boston Red Sox made Beane an offer of $12,500,000 to become their GM,[33] but he declined.[37] On April 15, 2005, Beane received a contract extension to remain with the Athletics as its general manager through 2012, and new team owner Lewis Wolff awarded Beane a small portion of the team's ownership.[38] In February 2012, the Athletics extended Beane's contract through 2019.[39]
From their 2006 playoff appearance until 2012 when they again made the playoffs, the Athletics had not made the playoffs or finished above .500, which had triggered criticism of Beane and his approach in some quarters in baseball, especially in 2009.[36] Beane largely dismisses criticism of his approach, indicating that his philosophy revolves around research and analysis.[36] Many other general managers have followed Beane's strategy and now use similar approaches.[40]
The book itself has changed the way different players are valued, and Beane began concentrating on high school players, a group he once largely ignored, in the MLB draft, considering them to be heavily undervalued.[36] He and other like-minded GMs also changed their draft strategies to focus more on defensive skills, which had become undervalued in the years immediately after the Moneyball revolution. This new emphasis on defense was displayed in the 2010 season; although the Athletics finished at .500 and again missed the playoffs, they led MLB in defensive efficiency, measured as the percentage of balls put into play by opponents that resulted in outs, and allowed the fewest runs in the AL.[41] In the 2012 season the Athletics again made the playoffs under Beane winning the American League West title on the last day of the regular season. The Athletics returned to the playoffs in 2013 by also winning the American League West division title in the 2013 season, the team's first back-to-back division championships since the 2002–2003 seasons.
In December 2009, Sports Illustrated named Beane as number 10 on its list of the Top 10 GMs/Executives of the Decade in all sports.[42][a]
On October 5, 2015, the Oakland Athletics announced that Beane had been promoted to Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations. Assistant GM David Forst assumed the job of general manager.[43]
Activities outside baseball[edit]
Soccer[edit]
When the Athletics ownership group agreed to purchase the reincarnation of the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer, Beane, who has expressed a passion for soccer, began developing a system for objectively analyzing soccer players. He has agreed to help the Earthquakes front office develop a method for building a cost-effective team, as the salary cap in MLS is even more restrictive than the Athletics status as a small-market team in Major League Baseball.[44] However, a system has yet to be implemented.
Beane has claimed that Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger is a personal idol. His friendship with ex-Arsenal scout Damien Comolli and Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke allowed him to delve deep into the world of English football.[45]
In March 2015, the Dutch football club AZ Alkmaar, under general director Robert Eenhoorn, a former Major Leaguer, hired Beane as an advisor.[46]
Software industry[edit]
On January 4, 2007, the software company NetSuite named Beane to its board of directors. NetSuite co-founder Evan Goldberg cited Beane's ability to combine facts with instinct as an important factor in the decision to involve him in the company.[47] Beane also served as a consultant for, and also appears in, the video game MLB Front Office Manager.[48][49]
Depiction in book and film Moneyball[edit]
Because of his team's success despite its low payroll, Beane was the subject of author Michael Lewis's 2003 best-selling book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. The book discusses Beane's methods as the GM of the Athletics and how he, along with Harvard-educated statistician Paul DePodesta,[50] used sabermetric principles to run his team in a cost-effective way. According to the book, this allowed him to be successful despite his financial constraints. The book and Beane's methods have influenced the way many think about the game of baseball, including other teams and players.[51] Brad Pitt played the role of Beane in the 2011 film Moneyball.[36] Pitt was nominated for the 2012 Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his performance.
Personal life[edit]
Twice married, Beane has a daughter Casey from his first marriage and twins Brayden and Tinsley from his current marriage.[36][52] He attended the University of California, San Diego during the baseball offseasons of his playing career.[53]

William L. 1985 Watches: 50s vintage chronograph
William L. 1985 wants to democratize watches, breaking traditional codes by providing affordable quality watches. 
Design was inspired by an iconic 50s vintage Swiss chronograph, while modernizing the lines into a current one, with always attention to details. Oppositions, paradoxes that come together to create a unique product. 
William L. 1985 was founded by Guillaume Laidet, a young timepieces aficionado who use to work in the Swiss watch industry. After several years at the service of some of the most prestigious watchmaking companies, he decided to start his own brand, aiming at offering meaningful collections inspired by a 50s vintage chronograph that he inherited from his grand-grand-uncle. 
This family jewel, once restored, quickly caught the eyes of his friends but the price, for most of them, was a real deal breaker. This is exactly why William L. 1985 was born: to offer quality timepieces with classic designs for a very attractive price point.
For nearly a year and thanks to his many contacts within the watchmaking industry, Guillaume developed a modern and affordable version of his vintage chronograph. No pretending here! The brand does not hide its Chinese production. Each piece is conceived in Paris and manufactured in Shenzhen, enabling William L. 1985 to compete in this price range. 
To initiate his project, Guillaume naturally chose the crowdfunding option and rapidly got very positive feedbacks and more importantly a community that shares its philosophy and gathered around him. 
Thanks to you, it is now together that we continue to build William L. 1985 history...
