L-3 Unmanned Systems Introduces New Group 2 Unmanned Aircraft System
L-3’s APEX UAS currently operational by U.S. Forces

ASHBURN, Va., May 5, 2014 – L-3 Unmanned  Systems announced today that it will introduce its Airborne  Pursuit and Exploitation (APEX) Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System  (UAS) at the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International’s (AUVSI) Unmanned  Systems 2014 conference. L-3’s APEX UAS is a compact,  lightweight system designed as a small tactical Intelligence, Surveillance and  Reconnaissance (ISR) platform, with a capacity to carry multiple payloads  simultaneously. It is ideal for close-range ISR missions, first responder calls  or over-the-hill reconnaissance missions, low-intensity conflicts and urban  warfare operations. APEX will be on display at the L-3 exhibit, Booth 401,  at the AUVSI conference, May 12–15 at the Orange  County Convention Center in Orlando, Fla.
“With  APEX, we’re offering today’s warfighters an unprecedented level of capability  from a small platform,” said J.R. Gear, vice president of strategic development  at L-3 Unmanned Systems. “APEX’s ability to be operated by a very small team  and provide multi-mission and payload flexibility brings a new level of  capability to expeditionary operators. The system is currently being used by  U.S. Forces.”
APEX is an all-electric UAS that  provides nearly seven hours of endurance with a range of 100+ km using a high-power  series Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery system and is runway-independent  and expeditionary. Operated by a team of three people, APEX reduces the need for  a large operational footprint, while providing the equivalent ISR capability  offered by larger UAS platforms. L-3’s APEX employs a parachute recovery system,  eliminating the need for a runway or specific recovery device, and utilizes a  pneumatic rail-launched system. Unique to the UAS is an electro-optical/cooled infrared  gimbal payload, which provides both day and night surveillance and  reconnaissance capability.
Based  in Ashburn, Va., L-3 Unmanned Systems is an industry leader in the design,  development and manufacture of specialized Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), C4ISR  collection and dissemination systems, and ruggedized command and control  systems. To learn more about L-3 Unmanned Systems, please visit the company’s  website at www.L3T.com/uas.
              Headquartered  in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 48,000 people  worldwide and is a prime contractor in aerospace systems and national security  solutions. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of communication and  electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. The  company reported 2013 sales of $12.6 billion.

BREA, Calif., July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, XDimensional Technologies announced that Transport Risk Management (TRM), a leading Aviation Insurance Brokerage, MGU and Risk Manager, has launched a program for UAS/UAV (Unmanned Aircraft Systems/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) risks, based on the capabilities of the XD Insurance Processing Platform.  Transport Risk Management, a program manager for Allianz, chose the XD Insurance Processing Platform based on its comprehensive functional capabilities, value, and its ability to reduce friction for their high volume, low margin UAS/UAV and drone insurance program.








Terry Miller, President of Transport Risk Management states, "Pursuing new markets in a rapidly changing insurance world means providing our clients with insurance services and products that meet the highest standards of quality.  It became clear that we needed to partner with like-minded, innovative technology and business partners in order to complement our deep vertical expertise.  We found those partnerships in XDimensional Technologies and Allianz.  With the advanced XD Insurance Processing Platform capabilities and the industry-leading Allianz Program, we are able to brand and deploy robust portals direct to consumers, as well as to retail agent websites, in virtually no time, and make the portal user experience expedient and seamless.  Each portal provides automated online submissions; real-time quoting, policy issuance and management; as well as invoicing and payment processing.  This provides instant scalability to the marketplace, and rapidly expanding revenues across the board.  Additionally, with XDimensional's Platform advances in Usage-Based Insurance (UBI) and Telematics, we are able to address Pay-Per-Use markets beyond those traditionally associated with UBI, and leverage Telematics in a variety of new ways that supplement current markets and facilitate new ones.  Needless to say, our UAS/UAV program is just the first of many in the pipeline."
James Van Meter, J.D., Aviation Practice Leader, Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty states, "Allianz has been dedicated to the UAS/UAV market for many years; there are phenomenal growth opportunities as this new industry evolves.  To keep pace with the growth and evolution of the UAS/UAV market, it's key to have a cutting-edge software solution like the platform that has been created by the collaboration between Transport Risk Management and XDimensional.  The XD Insurance Processing Platform is a game-changer and will allow us to better serve our clients and grow this important portfolio."
Rodney Gist, CEO of XDimensional Technologies adds, "We couldn't be more pleased to be teaming with TRM and Allianz.  Terry Miller's thought leadership, industry expertise, and innovative approach has made this business model possible within the aviation insurance marketplace.  His vision, foresight and comprehensive Allianz program is a benefit not only to his clients and agents, but to the industry as a whole.  XDimensional is particularly excited to have the opportunity to leverage our UBI feature set in support of such a dynamic and rapidly evolving marketplace."
