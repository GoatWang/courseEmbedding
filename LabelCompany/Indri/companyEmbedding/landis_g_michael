Title: Technician
               Company: Carlisle Syntec Inc
Job Details
               Carlisle SynTec Incorporated has been supplying roofing systems to the international market for more than twenty years. Ten years ago, we formed an international division to address this market. The reason was simple. We know that foreign construction comes with a unique set of challenges. Doing business abroad involves adapting to a different way of doing things--new customs, laws, government regulations, currency, and language. It also means greater distance which can lead to higher costs. Our International Operations Department is experienced in meeting those challenges. It is our job to make the best single-ply roof in America work for you worldwide. We will provide a detailed bill of quantities and see your project through from design to on-site training and final inspection. We have seven international offices and seven distribution centers around the world. Carlisle Roofing Systems have been installed in more than 50 countries, including Hong Kong, Guam, Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union, Mexico, and Columbia to name just a few. Carlisle roofs are there because no other company matches our expertise and service. We don't just sell products, we provide roofing systems that work. Carlisle helped to pioneer the single-ply roof in the early 1960's and remains today's leader for many good reasons:Top quality materials and products Roofs that are lightweight Quick, economical installations Complete freight forwarding Five single-ply designs - one for every type of roof Designs pre-engineered to meet specific building requirements Roofs that perform in any climate When you choose a Carlisle Roofing System for your foreign installations, you get high quality products, complete service, and competitive prices. Although roofing usually reflects a small percentage of the cost of the construction project, maintenance can be a major drain on your profits later. That's why a low-maintenance, trouble-free, single-ply roof makes sense--anywhere in the world. When you choose Carlisle, we go where you need us.

Landis Shoe Machines


Gateway Shoe Machine is proud of it's historical connection to Landis Shoe Machine Company.

Shortly after WW2 Tony Mueller began his involvement in what turned out be a fruitful and long career in the shoe service industry. In 1958 Tony made his decision to go to work for Landis Shoe Machine Company. This decision had proved to be a good one for the shoe repair industry. Tony’s efforts truly bolstered the shoe machinery industry. In 1959, after several months of intense training at the Landis Shoe Machine Production Facility in St. Louis, Mr. Mueller was assigned to his first territory with Landis Shoe Machine. Tony was truly blessed to be taking over the territory once held by Max Brown, a legend in the shoe machine servicing field. By that time, Mr. Brown had worked for almost all of the major shoe machine companies. Max was able to give Tony not only more intense training on the Landis Shoe Machine equipment, but many other brands of shoe machinery. Soon Tony had become one of Landis’ top salesmen and without a doubt their top service technician. Because of Tony’s ability to service not only Landis machines, but many other brands of shoe machines as well, Tony was sent by Landis Shoe Machine Company to many other territories to service shoe repair equipment. In 1972, Tony’s territory was relocated to the state of Illinois and many of the surrounding states. By this time Landis Shoe Machine Company had moved to Dexter, Maine. Because of Tony’s centralized location, Tony and his team of expert technicians were rebuilding most of the shoe repair machinery for Landis, that the company’s many salesmen were able to begin selling throughout the United States. Tony had then began speaking at major Universities and vocational schools that offered shoe repair and O & P training. He gave the students hands-on experience for maintaining their Landis shoe repair equipment. By 1977, Tony was so well known throughout the Shoe repair industry that he launched his own shoe repair machinery company. Because of its location near St. Louis, the new company was named Gateway Shoe Machine, a name that has become world renown in the shoe repair industry. Beginning in 1972, his son Steve began working with Tony, and became one of the technicians in the facility in which Mr. Mueller had been rebuilding machines for Landis Shoe Machine near St. Louis. Steve continued in the footsteps of his father in the shoe machinery industry. After Tony passed in 1990, Steve became owner of Gateway Shoe Machine. In 1991, Jerry Mueller brought with him his wealth of knowledge from Sutton Shoe Machine to became a member of Gateway Team.
