Badger Licensing LLC (Badger) announced that LG Chem Ltd.  (LG Chem) has successfully started commercial operation of a new unit utilizing Badger’s proprietary advanced residue recovery technology in LG Chem’s existing bisphenol A (BPA) facilities in Yeosu, Korea. The BPA plants in Yeosu are the first in the world to utilize the new residue recovery technology. The startup occurred within 11 months after the award of the contract, which included technology license, process design, and start-up services. LG Chem operates two BPA plants at the Yeosu site, in addition to one BPA plant at their Daesan, Korea, site, all licensed from Badger. The new residue recovery unit is integrated into the existing Yeosu facilities.
