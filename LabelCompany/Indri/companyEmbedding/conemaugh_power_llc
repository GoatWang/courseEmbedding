Facility[edit]
The station generates enough electricity to light 17 million 100-watt bulbs. The facility consists of two steam turbines, which began commercial operation in 1970 and 1971, and two cooling towers.
The main turbines run on steam produced by twin year-around 850 MWe boilers,[1] each as tall as a 14-story building. The plant uses more than 4 million tons of coal each year. Conemaugh has two hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers which provide recirculating water to cool and condense the steam and to limit the amount of water needed from the river.
The plant is one of several in the area, situated near Pennsylvania deep mines and is basically a twin of the Keystone Generating Station, partially owned by PSEG Power.
Controlling emissions[edit]
To control emissions, the plant is equipped with electrostatic precipitators and low-NOx burners. A wet limestone flue-gas desulfurization system was installed in the mid 1990s. The plant donated a particularly scenic portion of the site, known locally as Buttermilk Falls, to Indiana County for use as a wildlife refuge.
Company[edit]
The plant employs about 200 people and is one of the largest employers in Indiana County. It is a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc.
Court ruling[edit]
In March 2011, PennEnvironment and the Sierra Club won a favorable court ruling finding that the plant had committed 8,684 violations of the Clean Water Act by discharging waste directly into the Conemaugh River. On June 6, 2011 GenOn agreed to a $5 million settlement with $3.75 million going toward the restoration of the river.[2]

Facility[edit]
The station generates enough electricity to light 17 million 100-watt bulbs. The facility consists of two steam turbines, which began commercial operation in 1970 and 1971, and two cooling towers.
The main turbines run on steam produced by twin year-around 850 MWe boilers,[1] each as tall as a 14-story building. The plant uses more than 4 million tons of coal each year. Conemaugh has two hyperbolic natural draft cooling towers which provide recirculating water to cool and condense the steam and to limit the amount of water needed from the river.
The plant is one of several in the area, situated near Pennsylvania deep mines and is basically a twin of the Keystone Generating Station, partially owned by PSEG Power.
Controlling emissions[edit]
To control emissions, the plant is equipped with electrostatic precipitators and low-NOx burners. A wet limestone flue-gas desulfurization system was installed in the mid 1990s. The plant donated a particularly scenic portion of the site, known locally as Buttermilk Falls, to Indiana County for use as a wildlife refuge.
Company[edit]
The plant employs about 200 people and is one of the largest employers in Indiana County. It is a subsidiary of GenOn Energy Inc.
Court ruling[edit]
In March 2011, PennEnvironment and the Sierra Club won a favorable court ruling finding that the plant had committed 8,684 violations of the Clean Water Act by discharging waste directly into the Conemaugh River. On June 6, 2011 GenOn agreed to a $5 million settlement with $3.75 million going toward the restoration of the river.[2]

ArcLight closes on buy of stakes in two Pennsylvania coal plants
Exelon sold these power plant stakes to affiliates of ArcLight

01/09/2015
By Barry Cassell








Two affiliates of equity investor ArcLight Capital Partners on Jan. 9 notified the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that they have completed a buy of stakes in the coal-fired Keystone and Conemaugh power plants in Pennsylvania from units of Exelon (NYSE: EXC).
On Dec. 23, the commission authorized the acquisition of existing generation facilities, related to the transfer of undivided ownership interests in the Conemaugh Electric Generating Station and Keystone Electric Generating Station from Constellation Power Source Generation LLC and Exelon Generation Co. LLC to Arclight's Chief Conemaugh Power LLC and Chief Keystone Power LLC. "This letter is to advise the Commission that the Transaction was completed on December 31, 2014," said the Jan. 9 filing.
Constellation Power had held a 20.99% undivided ownership interest as a tenant-in-common in the Keystone Station and a 10.56% undivided ownership interest as a tenant-in-common in the Conemaugh Station. Exelon Generation held a 20.99% undivided ownership interest as a tenant-in common in the Keystone Station and a 20.72% undivided ownership interest as a tenant-in-common in the Conemaugh Station. Constellation Power and Exelon Generation had rights to approximately 535 MW of energy and capacity from Conemaugh and 718 MW of energy and capacity from Keystone.
Notable is that the PPL Corp. (NYSE: PPL) stakes in both plants are to be spun off in the new Talen Energy.
Keystone is a 1,711-MW coal-fired facility located in Shelocta, Pa. Conemaugh is a 1,711-MW coal-fired facility located in New Florence, Pa. They are interconnected to the transmission system owned by Pennsylvania Electric and operated by PJM Interconnection.
Chief Conemaugh and Chief Keystone are wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of ArcLight Fund V, which is a private equity fund managed by ArcLight Capital Partners.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Dec. 19 accepted market-based rate tariffs for Chief Keystone and Chief Conemaugh in relation to operation of these ownership stakes.
