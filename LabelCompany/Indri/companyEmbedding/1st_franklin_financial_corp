1st Franklin Financial: Yesterday and TodaySince 1941, 1st Franklin Financial Corporation has had one goal—to serve the financial needs of our friends and neighbors with the respect and personal service they deserve. It’s been over 70 years since Founder Ben F. Cheek, Jr. made his first $34 auto loan. And while times have changed, our commitment to customers has not. Our customers know us and more importantly, we know them. This commitment is why we’ve been able to help generations of families in times when they have needed us most.
With 307 loan offices in 6 states, 1st Franklin Financial Corporation continues to provide personal loans, supplying our customers with the cash they need. With offices located primarily in rural locations, we understand the struggles in these areas. We offer loans for auto repairs, home improvements, or debt consolidation. We can help with starter loans, wedding loans, medical expense loans, funeral loans or a small personal loan to help you meet day to day expenses. We also offer Retail Sales Financing to help our local small businesses grow. Whatever the need, we can answer all of your loan questions and help you find a solution.

“We are helping people live life each day.”
-Ginger Herring, President and CEO

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        1st Franklin Financial Corporation has received 3.9 out of 5 stars based on 3 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

The process took 3 days. I interviewed at 1st Franklin Financial (Cornelia, GA) in September 2015.InterviewI was contacted very soon after applying to set up an interview. The individual was engaging & personable however unclear as to specific expectations of job applied for. I enjoyed talking with the interviewer except he kept cutting off my answers each time he felt he had enough information. He was open to my questions about the position & company & seemed genuinely vested personally in the company. The salary was not effectively communicated at all online showing $10+ per hour in addition to commission. I was offered minimum wage plus commission; compensation can be lucrative but I personally felt with my years of experience that a higher wage could have been offered. Had I known this before I wouldn't have even considered the position.Interview Questions Describe an issue that arose between you and your previous manager that you disagreed on & explain how you handled it.   1 Answer Pick a product that you know about from a former job & sell it to me.

Is a C Corporation Right For Your Business?
What you need to know about forming a C Corporation













What Is a C Corporation?
A C Corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax, regulatory and official reasons. A C Corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business, and contrasts with other popular business structures including Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), S Corporations, Sole Proprietorships and others.
Generally, a C Corporation structure is better for larger businesses. This is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares, through having an Initial Public Offering, or IPO. A C Corporation is much more attractive to potential investors, including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation.
The majority of larger businesses in the United States are structured as C Corporations, although a C Corp could, theoretically, consist of just one person. The information below will help you decide if a C Corporation structure is right for your business.
How Is a C Corporation Formed?
A C Corp, also known as a corporation, is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing “Articles of Incorporation” with the Secretary of State in the state of incorporation. The policies, articles, cost and regulations for forming a C Corp vary from state-to-state. Details on exactly how to form a C Corporation can be found at the end of this article.
The corporation is the oldest form of business entity. It has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose, with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own. Although a C Corp is a popular business structure, there are other options for forming businesses in the US.
The Advantages of C Corporations
Forming a C Corporation does have several benefits:
1. A C Corporation has Limited Liability
Because a C Corp is a separate legal entity, the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors, investors and shareholders. Generally, the owners of a C Corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations. This does not apply in all cases, for example if corporate funds are misused, there is wilful fraud, or if certain rules and regulations are not followed.
2. A C Corporation Exists Independently of its Owners
A C Corporation can have “Perpetual Existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business.
3. Ownership of C Corporations Can Be Fluid and Transferred
Ownership in a C Corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues. These stocks can be bought and sold between investors, and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange, institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company.
4. Ease of Access to Funding Through Issuing Stock
If a C Corporation want to raise money, it can hold an “Initial Public Offering (IPO)” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange. This can bring significant money into a business. They can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding, although this can dilute the value of existing shares.
5. Enhanced Business or Corporate Credibility
Most of the businesses that are household names are C Corporations. Incorporating as a C Corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority.
The Disadvantages of a C Corporation
A C Corporation does have some disadvantages. Briefly, they are:

A different tax structure to other types of businesses.
Double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them.
Legal rules, regulations, formalities, and compliance they have to meet.

We cover these in more detail below.
What Are the Differences Between an S Corp, C Corp and LLC?
Two other popular business entity structures in the US are the S Corp and the LLC. They provide many of the same protections offered by a C Corp but have less formal rules on taxation, governance and compliance. This can mean more flexibility in how an LLC or S Corp is owned and funded.
One of the main differences between C Corps and S Corps / LLCs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed.

For LLCs and S Corps, any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’ / shareholders’ / members’ tax returns, where it is taxed as part of1 their overall income. The company does not have to file a separate tax return.
S Corps and C Corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.
S Corps are limited to having a maximum of 100 shareholders.
A C Corp is taxed at the corporate level — That means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned.

How Are Profits And Taxes Handled With A C Corp?
A C Corporation is taxed as a separate business entity. Unlike individuals, C Corporations have to file a designated tax form with the IRS, which is called IRS Form 1120. Additionally, C Corporations have their own tax rates.
Corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital, this can shelter some of the profits from taxation.
C Corporation Tax Rates
The tax rates levied on C Corporations are as follows.
Profit

Up to $50,000 — 15%
$50,000 - $75,000 — 25%
$75,000 - $100,000 — 34%
$100,000 - $335,000 — 39%
$335,000 - $10,000,000 — 34%
$10,000,000 - $15,000,000 — 35%
$15,000,000 - $18,333,333 — 38%
More than $18,333,333 — 35%

Stock Dividends from C Corporations
A C Corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends, which are distributed to shareholders. The percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own.
Dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice (double-taxed). They are taxed first at the corporate level as profit (on the corporation’s form 1120), and again at the individual level as stock dividends (on the shareholder's form 1040).
What are a C Corporation's Legal Requirements?
A C Corporation must meet certain requirements:
1. Hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the shareholders and the board of directors
The annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information, strategic decisions, opportunities, risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with.
2. Issue shares to investors as ownership of the business
Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares. The management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.
3. Appoint a board of directors
The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation. These are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed.
4. Assign Certain Positions in the Corporation
A C Corporation will need to have all of the following positions. In a small C Corp, one person could hold multiple of these positions.

Shareholders: They own the company's stock and are responsible for electing directors, amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation like mergers and the sale of corporate assets. They alone are allowed to dissolve the corporation.
Directors: They manage the corporation and are responsible for issuing stock, electing officers and making the corporation's major decisions.
Officers: The corporation must have a president, secretary, and treasurer. These officers are responsible for making the day-to-day decisions that govern the corporation's operation.
Employees: They receive a salary in return for their work for the corporation.

Forming a C Corporation
If a C Corporation is right for you, here’s how to form one:

Choose a legal name for your new business.
If the Secretary of State in your state reserves business names, reserve the name.
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation — These should be sent to your Secretary of State.
Establish who your initial investors and shareholders are.
Create and issue stock certificates to your shareholders.
Apply for a business license — You may require licenses from your state, county, and township.
Apply for any other certificates you need to conduct business — These can vary from industry to industry.
Get an “Employer Identification Number (EIN): from the IRS — You can file online, or complete form SS-4.
Apply for any other ID numbers and complete other formalities required by your state and local government agencies.
Requirements do vary from one jurisdiction to another, but you will generally need to get ID numbers for the unemployment, disability and other payroll taxes.
Appoint a board of directors.
Assign other positions in the business as required by law.

Forming a C Corporation can be tricky, so let us do the hard work for you. Here at IncFile, we’ve helped to form thousands of businesses, and our experts are on hand to help you, right now. Incorporate your business with Incfile for as little as $49 plus the state fee.

When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.
