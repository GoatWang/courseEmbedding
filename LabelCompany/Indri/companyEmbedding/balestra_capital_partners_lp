Balestra Capital: "If Government Programs Were Cancelled, The Economy Would Collapse Back Into Severe Recession"




While hardly an opinion that would be questioned around these parts, it  is still good to see that even some of the smart money shares our views  about the Schrodinger Economy ('alive' and 'dead' at the same time,  depending if the BLS or anyone else is observing it) and we are not  totally insane vis-a-vis one-time, non recurring government bailouts, which just incidentally have become perpetual and endless:  "The Federal government has manfully stepped up to fill the gap left by  consumers who have been forced to retrench and who are trying to repair  their finances by paying down debt and increasing their savings.  So  the next question has to be:  Is this recovery self-sustaining or is the  economy still on life support, held together by periodic massive  liquidity injections and ultra low interest rates, and accompanied by a  dangerous, if not reckless, expansion of government debt?  We think that  if government programs were canceled, the economy would collapse back  into severe recession." And here Balestra's Chris Gorgone explains quite  astutely why anyone betting on a decoupling or perpetual USD reserve  status may want to reconsider: "the U.S. is no longer in complete  control of its own destiny.  We exist now in a world of increasing  correlation in the arenas of economics, finance, trade, politics, etc.   What happens in Europe, China, the Middle East, etc. will have major  impacts on American economic, political, and social outcomes.  The  world is changing  rapidly.  The old rules that so many investors rely  upon may no longer apply the way they did during the great growth years  after World War II." Alas, this too is spot on.

SAC Up 9.2% YTD, Paulson Heart Boehner, And Other Hedge Fund Observations




For those who live and breathe solely to know how Stevie Cohen has  performed at any given moment, we have an update. According to  Bloomberg's Hedge Funds brief, SAC Capital told investors last week that  his main hedge fund is up 9.2% year to date. It is unclear if he  provided any further insight into the firm's troubled relationship with  various regulators and law enforcement officials. Some other fund update  from Bloomberg. Balestra Capital Partners LP was negative 2.37 percent  last month and has lost 7.63 percent year-to-date, according to its  monthly results and commentary sent to investors. Brencourt Advisors  LLC’s $260 million Brencourt Multi-Strategy Fund lost 90 basis points to  drop year-to-date returns to 2.84 percent, according to an email update  sent to investors. The merger arbitrage fund gained 22 basis points  last month and has returned 2.17 percent through June 30. The Brencourt  Credit Opportunities Fund lost 0.95 percent and has returned 3.39  percent in 2011. Broadfin Capital LLC’s Broadfin Healthcare Fund LP  returned nearly 9 percent in the second quarter, according to its  quarterly letter to investors, a copy of which was obtained by  Bloomberg. Long positions in Alkermes Inc. and Hi-Tech Pharmacal Co.  Inc. “were the largest drivers of the fund’s performance,” the letter  said. The New York-based fund is managed by Kevin Kotler. Summarizing  returns by strategy for 2010 and 2011 (table below) shows quite vividly  that what worked back in 2010 is no longer in vogue, although the main  exception - the best strategy for both years - continues to be  Mortgage-Backed arbitrage. Although most curious for some may be that none other than John Paulson is now officially the biggest fan of John Boehner. Read on.

Balestra Capital: "We View Gold As Potentially The Best Currency"




We view gold as potentially the best currency; an ongoing portfolio theme based on the probability that central bankers in the U.S., Europe and Japan will continue their efforts to stimulate their economies with excessive monetary easing (printing money), while ignoring for the time being the dangerous fiscal ramifications. While deflation is the current problem, these policies increase the risk of a sudden turn to inflation. Without the return of significant global growth it is possible that we get the worst outcome in the form of stagflation. For example, oil and other commodity producers may start to demand higher prices in debasing currencies even though unemployment remains high and wages are stagnant or falling. Our analysis of commodities markets indicates that this effect has already begun. James Melcher, Balestra Capital

Risk Aversion Taking Hold




After months of injected liquidity chasing risk assets through a pervasive USD-funded carry trade, the liquidity has dried, credit markets have begun to diverge from equities, cash flow problems in the real economy have resurfaced, the dollar has started a deleveraging-based short squeeze rally, and risk aversion is becoming the name of the game again.

Deep Thoughts From James Melcher Of Balestra Capital - Must Read




"We are no longer in a golden age. We are in trouble. The correction of economic and social
distortions that have built up over the past twenty years is underway. It is creating serious
ongoing economic and social problems, and despite the reassurances of central bankers and
investment pundits, there is no easy way to deal with it. The Fed’s standard remedy for treating
recessions by lowering interest rates and boosting liquidity has been seriously abused since
1982. The normal clearing function of recessions was aborted by an over-reactive monetary
intervention in every case, while fiscal irresponsibility at all levels of government mounted
unimpeded, and regulators were curtailed, reviled, or fired. These policies are not a template for
remediation. As we wrote in a recent Balestra Bulletin: for policymakers to expect the most
over-borrowed and over-spent consumers in the world to borrow and spend more in order to
carry us out of this recession is foolishness. So we suggest that the experts change their
playbook and look for guidance at the U.S. from the late 1920s through the 1930s, or more
recently, Japan’s ongoing tortuous financial struggle, which has its roots in the excesses of the
1980s." - Balestra Capital
