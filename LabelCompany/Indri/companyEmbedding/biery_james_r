Pennsylvania Senate Confirms James R. Biery to Banking and Securities Commission

Apr 10, 2014, 13:42 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Pennsylvania Office of the Governor 











 
















































 

 




















 


HARRISBURG, Pa., April 10, 2014 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Pennsylvania Senate has unanimously confirmed James R. Biery of Silver Spring Township, Cumberland County, to serve as commissioner on the Pennsylvania Banking and Securities Commission. 
"Jim has proven his leadership and commitment to Pennsylvania's economic success throughout his career with the Pennsylvania Bankers Association," Governor Tom Corbett said. "His exceptional experience has prepared him well for this position. I am confident that Jim will serve Pennsylvania and the Banking and Securities Commission with integrity and dedication." 
Biery, a graduate of Lebanon Valley College and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, retired in 2013 as president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Bankers Association, where he had served since 1976. 
Biery chaired the State Association Division of the American Bankers Association, and has served on the boards of the Silver Spring Township Authority and the Cumberland Valley School District's Eagle Foundation. He chaired the Corbett Administration's transition team for the Department of Banking. He serves on the boards of the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) and DNB First, a bank serving Chester and Delaware counties. 
Biery replaces Steve Irwin, who joined the Pennsylvania Securities Commission in 2006. Irwin continued service on the Banking and Securities Commission following the merger of the Securities Commission into the Department of Banking in 2012.
"Steve Irwin has served Pennsylvania investors, businesses and consumers with great skill and commitment," said Glenn E. Moyer, secretary of the Department of Banking and Securities and vice-chair of the Banking and Securities Commission. "He has been a stalwart advocate and an excellent representative of Pennsylvania's interests. We express our appreciation for his service to the commonwealth."
Comprised of five commissioners, the Pennsylvania Banking and Securities Commission serves as an adjudicatory body for the Department of Banking and Securities. Former Pennsylvania Attorney General Jerry Pappert serves as chair of the commission.
