☛ Alan Steen VP Governmental Affairs at Glazer’s 3-23-14


			Posted  by admin on Mar 23, 2014 in BREAKING NEWS, WHO, WHAT & WHERE | 2 comments 
 
ALAN STEEN NAMED VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT GLAZER’S INC
 
March 23, 2014
Alan Steen, the new Vice President for Governmental Affairs with Glazer’s, one of the country’s largest privately held companies, and one of the nation’s largest distributors of wine, spirits and malt beverage products.
Glazer’s, Inc. , one of the country’s largest privately-held companies and one of the nation’s largest distributors of wine, spirits and malt beverage products, has announced the hiring of Alan Steen as Vice President for Government Affairs, which was effective October 14, 2013.
 
In this new role for the company, Steen is responsible for representing Glazer’s in legislative and regulatory matters with governmental organizations and associated agencies, as well as direct the company’s lobbying efforts in all of its markets. Steen reports to Alan N. Greenspan, Esq., Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Glazer’s.
 
Alan Steen was the Administrator for the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission for 10 years. His tenure there was marked by high levels of transparency and the ability to build coalitions among the industry tiers. Steen has also held leadership roles with the Texas Youth Commission, and was an Adjunct Professor at Austin Community College, working in the Criminal Justice Department. He earned his BBA from Tarleton State University, and an MS from the University of North Texas.
 
Alan Greenspan commented: “We are truly honored that Alan Steen has agreed to lead our governmental affairs activities. Alan’s unique experience and his stature in our industry will greatly benefit the company.  Alan could have used his talents in many different ways and with many different organizations, so we are flattered that he chose Glazer’s.”
 
Alan Steen commented:   “It is an absolute thrill to be included in such an amazing group of people. The culture and professional atmosphere at Glazer’s consumes you, and to be a part of their team is a real honor.  I look forward to the contributions I can make to Glazer’s nationwide.  
 
Glazer’s, one of the country’s largest privately held companies, currently operates in 14 states and the Caribbean, and is one of the nation’s largest distributors of wine, spirits and malt beverage products.  The company has operations in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and the US Virgin Islands.  The third-generation family business was founded in Dallas in 1933.
 
In 2012, Steen served as the Executive Director of the National Cutting Horse Association for 11 weeks before quitting on Aug. 21 due to “misrepresentation and falsification of data issues with the association” according to an article in the Fort Worth Star Telegram.  He sued the NCHA as he had borrowed $67,000 to fully vest in his retirement fund when he resigned from the Texas Alcoholic and Beverage Commission to take the Executive Director job at the NCHA.  According to news reports, the lawsuit was quickly resolved amicably to the satisfaction of both parties.
 
Information for the above article was retrieved from a press release from Glazer’s and articles in the Fort Worth Star Telegram.

What a wonderful and encouraging article, proof that “good guys” can still win. Hang in there with your intensive research, objective reporting, and support for the “little guys” like me.
Sincerely,
A former NCHA member who remembers when cutting was a pleasure and was just about good horses, good competition and good friends , rather than how big the purse was!

Phyllis / March 26, 2014 
I really think you might have a strong influence on changing some of the negatives back to some of the positives of cutting. Hang in there! I think you are tenacious enough that you become stronger the more you are attacked by those responsible for the state that the sport now finds itself. Those of us who mourn the loss what was good about cutting in the past regard you as our advocate.
I wish that those of us who fall into the afore stated position could revive the informal jackpot cuttings for the fun of it. I have three trained cutting horses that are now just ranch horses because although they are “good” horses, they do not have the “preferred” credentials that are necessary to win today, and I don’t have the money to go show and donate to the owners of those preferred bloodlines.
A sincere thank you for being the conscience of the sport. I have been an avid reader of The Chatter and the Quarter Horse News for years, but your articles are the only ones that I read any longer in regards to the sport. Keep up the good work.

Did Success Spoil Tab Hunter?

By WILLIAM L. HAMILTONSEPT. 18, 2005

MONTECITO, Calif. - TO ask, "Whatever happened to Tab Hunter?" is to ask, "Whatever happened to America?" -- the America before the Kennedys were shot; before Vietnam, where Mr. Hunter's own brother died; Watergate; and later, Sept. 11 and the war on terror.In 1954 Mr. Hunter, 23, blond-haired and blue-eyed, the perfect product of a popular imagination as free from cynicism and care as a sky can be cloudless and clear, was No. 1 at the box office with "Battle Cry." By 1957 he was also No. 1 on the pop-music charts with "Young Love," toppling Elvis Presley.Invented by Hollywood and its press after being discovered shoveling manure in a stable in Los Angeles, Mr. Hunter, whose name at birth was Arthur Gelien, ruled the country's obsession with celebrity, and especially teenage America, which became, with stars like Mr. Hunter and his most famous co-star, Natalie Wood, the audience that the entertainment industry would fight over to this day. He was as beautiful to look at as he was virtuous to dream about, the pinup prototype for every male idol who was to come after, from Ricky Nelson to Brad Pitt.By 1959 his reign was ending. Troy Donahue appeared, Hollywood's next version of Tab Hunter, and Mr. Hunter, old at 28, began a 46-year descent through an actor's circles of hell: spaghetti westerns "that were short on meat sauce," as he described them, television guest shots, dinner theater and infomercials. There were still movies: a co-starring role in "Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood."

Mr. Donahue, once asked about the confusion about the two men and their careers, replied, "I'm the straight one." Continue reading the main story

Next month "Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star," an autobiography written with Eddie Muller, in which Mr. Hunter chronicles his life in public as America's golden boy and his life in private as a gay man, will be published by Algonquin Books. As Mr. Hunter stepped out with starlets like Ms. Wood in movies, magazines and Hollywood night spots, he pursued relationships with actors like Anthony Perkins, who eventually stopped seeing him, married and later died of AIDS.Mr. Hunter, like many celebrities who become international obsessions, is fairly simple in person. At 74, he says he prefers horses to people. He can swear with the best of them. He has lived quietly in a small cottage in this small town outside Santa Barbara for 12 years with his partner of 23 years, Allan Glaser, a producer. Oprah Winfrey has a place down the hill, 42 acres that she paid $55 million for, but that's entertainment. Nicely kept 230SL's buzz among the old-growth olive-grove roads like hornets. No one pretends that Montecito is Middle America.There's more to life than success, Mr. Hunter said last week, sitting in his garden with Mr. Glaser, talking about being Tab Hunter. One of their two whippets, Olivia, chewed on an acorn by his chair. Mr. Hunter has an actor's habit of holding one's eye with consequence as he answers questions, as if it were a camera."Rock? No," he said, asked if he had had sex with Rock Hudson, one of Hollywood's other A-list homosexuals in the 1950's. "Not my type." Mr. Hudson and Mr. Hunter shared an agent, Henry Willson, who was known as the gay Svengali for the beefcake stars he created."If it was up to Tab, it would be a book about horses, with about three pages of Hollywood in it," Mr. Glaser said. In his bedroom Mr. Glaser, who collects movie memorabilia and who met Mr. Hunter, then 52, when he was 23, has a large poster of Mr. Hunter, shirtless as he inevitably was, embracing Natalie Wood, his co-star in "The Burning Hills." In Mr. Hunter's bedroom, by the bed, is a collection of santos."You walk from my room, and in two steps you're 200 years earlier, from the 1940's to the 1740's," Mr. Glaser said. In Mr. Glaser's bathroom are photographs signed to him by Kim Novak, Elizabeth Taylor and Janet Leigh.The Tab Hunter story is a movie in the making. People in the business would say it's got everything. A father who throws a candy bar down on the New York hospital bed where his mother has just delivered him, and disappears. In Los Angeles a school choirmaster who molests him. The Coast Guard at 14. New York again at 15: parties where Cole Porter is playing the piano, Park Avenue, an older man in a Sulka robe and freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast. Hollywood at 16. Stardom by 20.

Then the chutes after the ladders, a thrill ride to the bottom set in Rome, Monte Carlo and Capri, as Mr. Hunter encountered Visconti and Nureyev, Princess Grace's personal secretary and the young shah of Iran, the tycoons, yachts, models, trust-fund babies, kings and queens, Champagne and caviar in the sunset of his beauty, what Mr. Hunter calls "the dessert course that never ends."And then the death of his only brother, Walt, a Navy medic killed in action two months after arriving in Vietnam. Movies with Vincent Price and Judy the Chimp. Then, in the 1980's, after a long voyage through dinner theater, which he described as "a sea of blue hair," and a heart attack, rediscovery, by John Waters, the underground filmmaker.Mr. Waters cast Mr. Hunter, who had worked with John Wayne as well as Ms. Wood, Sophia Loren and a roster of beauties, opposite Divine, his drag star, in "Polyester" in 1981. As Mr. Hunter decided, after the movie, which reinvented him as an ironic comment on his own Hollywood iconography, "I'd kissed a lot worse."

It was also a way of coming out."Making out with Divine, that's beyond the bravery of coming out," Mr. Waters said on Monday in a telephone conversation. "He was hassled about being gay. You couldn't come out. It was illegal. But he had a sense of humor about the glamour he was caught in. He's a great sport, and a great star." At his peak Mr. Hunter was a player with Warner Brothers under a seven-year contract. He said he thought the old-school Hollywood studio system, which had a substantial investment in its stable of stars, had protected him against bad publicity, including several insinuating stories by magazines like Confidential, and from being exposed as gay, despite an arrest at a gay party early in his career.As Ms. Wood and Mr. Hunter embarked on a well-publicized and groundless romance, promoting his apparent heterosexuality while promoting their movies, insiders developed their own headline for the item: "Natalie Wood and Tab Wouldn't."Mr. Hunter said that Hollywood in the 1950's had its version of "Don't ask, don't tell," which was "Don't complain, don't explain." Or, let the studio take care of you, and let the public draw its conclusions."There was a lot written about my sexuality, and the press was pretty darn cruel, but people believe what they want to believe," he said. What moviegoers wanted to hold in their hearts were the boy-next-door marines, cowboys and swoon-bait sweethearts he portrayed.Mr. Waters agreed, adding that America couldn't come to terms with something it knew little or nothing about."The public didn't know Tab was gay," he said. "The public didn't know what gay was. Newspapers wouldn't print the rumors. Liberace sued a newspaper, and won." Despite the acceptance of gay characters in television today and big-release movies like Ang Lee's "Brokeback Mountain," a cowboys-in-love story starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, which opens on Dec. 9, Mr. Waters said he thought Hollywood is more heterosexual than ever.

"I never thought Tom Cruise was gay," he said, discounting the rumors. "The A-list?" he said. "I don't think any of them are." And teenage audiences, the same demographic group that Mr. Hunter appealed to, are not as open to the issue as is assumed, Mr. Waters said."In rich-kid schools, gay's cool," he said. "In poor-kid schools, it's not cool."Mr. Glaser, a producer and a pragmatist, said he thought it was business as usual in Hollywood, that private mores do not dictate public ones even in an industry that tells America what to fantasize about. "What Hollywood wants to project is what will make money," he said. "It's still the boy-girl thing that's going to generate that kind of money."The bigger problem for Mr. Hunter, as it turned out, was wanting to be an actor and not an idol. His increasing ambition to play important roles recalls the tale of Pinocchio, the wooden puppet who wanted to be a real boy. A product of Hollywood, as he describes himself, Mr. Hunter watched Mr. Perkins succeed as an actor, the product of New York stage training, and leave him behind, uncomfortable with his good looks and lack of résumé.James Dean, a casual friend and another New York actor, became "the next Brando" in Hollywood's estimation in three pictures. Then he died, the surest way to end a career in Hollywood well. As Dean prepared for "East of Eden," Mr. Hunter shot "Track of the Cat" with Robert Mitchum. "What picture are we shooting today?" Mitchum would joke on the set.There have obviously been rewards, as Mr. Hunter calls them, and they kept him in the game, even after "Timber Tramps," a stroke and quadruple bypass surgery. A fountain splashed peacefully at the back of his manicured yard. His newest horse, Harlow, named for her flaxen mane, is being raised in New Mexico for show.But to sit with Mr. Hunter, a handsome man who hugged himself protectively, as if he were still fighting old ghosts, is to feel that anything he has has been hard earned."People will just take you, chew you up, spit you out, dump you on the side and go on to the next, and it's kind of tragic," he said of his profession. But his voice rose in heat as he spoke, as if he realized as he studied the part that it was really just Tab Hunter he was talking about. Continue reading the main story

MIAMI and DALLAS, Jan. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Southern Wine & Spirits of America, Inc. ("Southern") and Glazer's, Inc. ("Glazer's"), two of the country's leading wine and spirits distributors, today announced the signing of a definitive agreement that will create the largest North American wine and spirits distribution company, serving supplier and customer partners from coast to coast. 
The new company, Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits, LLC ("Southern Glazer's"), will distribute more than 150 million cases of wine and spirits annually, cover nearly 90% of the legal drinking age (LDA) population in the U.S., employ more than 20,000 team members, and have operations in 41 states plus the District of Columbia, the Caribbean, and Canada. The company will be headquartered in Miami, with significant ongoing operations, systems, executives, and team members to be based in Dallas.
The new company's leadership team and Board of Directors will be composed of representatives from both Southern and Glazer's. Harvey R. Chaplin will serve as Chairman, and Bennett Glazer will serve as Executive Vice Chairman. The company will be managed by an Office of the CEO and President, with Wayne E. Chaplin serving as Chief Executive Officer and Sheldon ("Shelly") Stein serving as President. Wayne Chaplin will be responsible for setting the company's overall strategic direction and day-to-day commercial and operational execution. Shelly Stein will be responsible for leading business development, merger and acquisition activities, and long-term growth initiatives on a global basis, and will assist with the strategic direction of the company as well as select key supplier relationships.
Harvey R. Chaplin, Chairman of Southern, said, "We are delighted to combine with Glazer's. Together, these two family-owned, industry leading organizations—each with a great history, strong values and entrepreneurial spirit, unmatched talent, and a track record of successful performance—will solidify our standing for years to come as the most capable and effective distributor in the industry." 
Bennett Glazer, Chairman of Glazer's, commented, "We are embracing a uniquely compelling opportunity to unite our proud family traditions and create an undisputed industry leader for years to come. Our mutual dedication to integrity and transparency, our commitment to our communities, the talent and professionalism of our people, and our drive to add value to our partners' businesses will continue to differentiate us clearly from the competition."
Wayne E. Chaplin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added, "The combination of two of the wine and spirits industry's leading distributors will create unmatched value for our business partners and position us for broader supplier alignments, which will translate into even greater opportunities for our team members. Southern and Glazer's have highly complementary cultures marked by an uncompromising commitment to superior service, driven by the most talented and experienced teams in the industry. Our new company will have the exceptional opportunity to build a combined organization that capitalizes on the extraordinary legacies and best practices of both companies. Quite simply, we will have the best team and the most extensive reach in the business."
Shelly Stein, President and Chief Executive Officer of Glazer's, concluded, "This is a historic day for our companies and for our industry. With our complementary footprints, Southern Glazer's will be the first truly cross-continental wholesaler. Our combined solution will offer suppliers a more efficient and effective route to market that will help their brands reach their fullest potential. By drawing from the best talent pool in the industry, strong customer relationships, and robust business intelligence products and services across both companies, we intend to build on our combined footprint, and enhance our current strategic relationships while forming new ones. We are excited to establish Southern Glazer's as the distributor of choice for valued customers and suppliers across North America."
Additional leadership roles at Southern Glazer's, reporting to the CEO, will include: Brad Vassar as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Mel Dick as Senior Vice President and President, Wine Division; Steven Becker as Executive Vice President, Treasurer & Compliance; Thomas Greenlee as Executive Vice President, Finance; Lee Hager as Executive Vice President, Secretary and Administration; and Alan Greenspan as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Furthermore, Glazer's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer Rob Swartz will lead the Integration Management Office (IMO), partnering with Southern's Executive Vice President, Commercial Strategy Kevin Fennessey. 
Both companies have successful track records of rapidly executing business combinations and supplier alignments without business disruption, and a joint IMO team will ensure Southern Glazer's effectively utilizes the best business practices and talent of both organizations to make the transition seamless for suppliers and customers alike.
The majority of Glazer's malt beverage distribution business is not included in the transaction. The business within Glazer's existing MillerCoors footprint will operate as a separate company, Glazer's Beer & Beverage, under the continued ownership of the Glazer family. The remainder of Glazer's malt beverage business and Southern's malt beverage business will become part of Southern Glazer's.
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2016, subject to regulatory approvals. 
BofA Merrill Lynch served as financial advisor to Southern and Moelis & Company served as financial advisor to Glazer's with respect to the transaction.
