GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREManagement Of Soft Tissue Sarcomaby Brennan, Murray/ Antonescu, Cristina/ Alektiar, Kaled/ Maki, RobertManagement of Soft Tissue Sarcoma, 2nd Edition provides the most comprehensive analysis of demographics and natural history currently available for  these lesions, based on the authors' experience with over 10,000 patients. Sections regarding radiation therapy not found in the previous text have been expanded, as have updates on molecular characteristics of sarcomas and chemotherapy studies published since the prior edition. Clinical and molecular diagnoses are addressed, and tumor histopathology is employed as the basis of treatment recommendations including surgery, radiation and systemic therapy. This is the first book to provide specific chemotherapy opinions for every sarcoma subtype. Written by four world-renowned experts, this book gives a practical, up-to-date approach to managing the many subtypes of adult soft tissue sarcoma. Reviews from the first edition: "This is an impressive book. Written by a surgeon, a pathologist and an oncologist, the book draws heavily on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center soft tissue sarcoma (STS) database...it is a book that should be in the library of any sarcoma unit and will appeal to the sub-specialist in Orthopaedic Oncology." (Robert U. Ashford, European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology, Vol. 24, 2014) "The book is laid out in 27 chapters, with an impressive inclusion of a wide array of sarcoma histology. One of the real strengths of the book is the quality and number of images, figures, tables, and graphs...The overall outline of the text is well done...This book is a unique and important addition to the sarcoma literature...this edtion should find itself on every medical oncologist's bookshelf ..."

Look Inside DescriptionReviewsContentsEditorsSeriesSubjectsDescriptionThis book examines the drivers of regionalism and integration in both Europe and Asia and seeks to forge comparative perspectives between the two regions.
Comprising contributions from scholars, analysts and policymakers, this volume explores and debates how and why regional bodies such as the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are formed and sustained. Furthermore, it examines the drivers of, and impediments to, regionalism and integration. The debates regarding what and who constitute drivers are presented in a fresh, thematic and comprehensive manner. Leadership and core states are also critically examined, whilst material, ideational and normative factors are all assessed comparatively. Significantly, in light of the global financial crisis, the book considers the role of crisis as a driver of regionalism and integration.
This book will be of interest to students, scholars and policymakers interested in Asian and European politics and comparative politics.ReviewsThis is a scholarly, comprehensive and timely study of the different experiences of regional integration that Europe and Asia, two of the world’s most diverse and important areas, have had in recent history. Covering issues like trust, sovereignty, reconciliation and values, the contributors show that in spite of differences, there is much that both can learn from each other as they strive for a more dynamic relationship in the 21st century.Kerry Brown, Director of the China Studies Centre and Professor of Chinese Politics, the University of Sydney.
The book offers rich insights into the drivers and development of regionalism in Europe and Asia, covering a wide range of themes and providing comparative perspectives between the two regions. Its worthy analysis represents an invaluable guide and a must-read for all who are interested in regional studies.
Emil Kirchner, Jean Monnet Chair, University of Essex.
This is an excellent book that fills a much needed gap in the literature on regional integration by analysing the comparative drivers of regional cooperation in Europe and Asia. What is especially welcome in this volume is a comparative approach that does not take European regional integration as a benchmark for Asian regional integration. It sets out an exciting agenda for future work on comparative regionalism which will be invaluable for researches working on regional governance. Highly recommended.
Kanishka Jayasuriya, Professor of Politics and International studies and Director of the Indo-Pacific Governance Research Centre at the University of Adelaide.  
Detailed yet highly accessible, a cutting-edge account of the key driving forces behind regional integration in Europe and Asia. Carefully avoiding a Eurocentric approach, the contributing authors provide scholars and policymakers alike with an essential source of conceptual, empirical, comparative and multidisciplinary insights into the study of regions.
Bart Gaens, Senior Research Fellow, The Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
The European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are two relatively successful regional organizations in the world, and their trans-regional cooperation in the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) is likely to redefine and affect both regional and global politics. In this context, there is an increasing demand for knowledge in order to understand both regional organizations and their collaborative relations and efforts. This edited book meets this demand by undertaking a comprehensive comparative study of European and Asian regionalism. The intellectual virtue of this book lies in the fact that it brings together diverse scholars from both regions and offers a variety of fresh perspectives. The uniqueness of this book is its focus on the multifaceted drivers of, as well as impediments to, regionalism in comparative terms. It covers a wide range of issues such as the role of crisis, traditional and non-traditional security, economic dynamics, regional institutions, and processes of European and Asian regional integration. I strongly recommend it as a textbook for graduate courses on international relations, comparative regionalism, and global politics. 
Professor Baogang HE, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
This volume is an important contribution to the quickly expanding field of research on Comparative Regionalism. In this comprehensive text, a broad range of potential driving forces of integration in Europe and Asia are being explored, from historical narratives and institutional dynamics to the influence of economic crises and sector-specific interests. Brennan and Murray have assembled a group of leading experts who leave no stone unturned in identifying the drivers and barriers to regionalism on the two continents.

Reviews




“This is an excellent monograph of the Diagnosis,
Pathology, Imaging, Treatment, and Surgical outcomes of sarcomas and related
tumors of the soft tissue variety. … This is a very good book for oropedic
surgeons, patologists, students, and clinicians with an interest in the
diagnosis and treatment of high and low grade liposarcomas, leomyosarcomas,
benign type lesions, and other kind of subcutaneous tumors with distant lung,
brain, and liver metastases.” (Joseph J. Grenier, Amazon.com, October, 2015)“This is an impressive book. Written by a surgeon, a pathologist and an oncologist, the book draws heavily on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center soft tissue sarcoma (STS) database. … it is a book that should be in the library of any sarcoma unit and will appeal to the sub-specialist in Orthopaedic Oncology.” (Robert U.

Philosophy



The nature of information is changing.  Communication technologies are driving humanity towards an increasingly hyperconnected and collaborative society.  While the potential to share ideas and creations is limitless, we must move towards this inevitable future as effective and ethical users of information.  
The skills of the 21st century learner and worker are based on critical thinking, communication and innovation.  It is imperative to build these strengths in our citizens through effective information literacy instruction.  Librarians and information specialists must play a key role in developing these talents, and I hope to have the opportunity to participate in this noble goal.  
Below are listings of my previous experience and education.  I have also included samples of lessons, presentations, and other work that showcase my abilities as a communicator.

"Collaboratively, Brennan, a natural teacher, created and implemented exceptional standards-based lessons that extensively involved students in inquiry-based projects.  Brennan's lessons offered students an opportunity to individualize and construct his or her learning experience.  They also offered the student's ownership of the process and the product, as well as an opportunity to be self-directed, apply critical/analytical thinking, organizational, and presentation skills...Clearly, he has the ability to create, implement, and manage an exemplary, dynamic, technologically rich 21st century school library media program." Mentor Evaluation

 
Cheryl  McCarthy

"Bravo! Brennan is the most outstanding student in my practicum and he shows the most promising skills as an LMS!
