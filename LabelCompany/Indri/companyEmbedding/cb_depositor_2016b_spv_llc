Independent Accountants� Report
on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures
�
�
Ladies and Gentlemen:
�
We have performed the procedures described
below, which were agreed to by CommonBond, Inc. (the �Company�) and Barclays Capital Inc. (the �Other Specified
Party� and, together with the Company, the �Specified Parties�), related to their evaluation of certain information
with respect to a portfolio of student loans in connection with the proposed offering of CommonBond Student Loan Trust 2016-A,
Private Credit Student Loan-Backed Notes (the �Transaction�).
�
This agreed-upon procedures engagement was
conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency
of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties of this report. Consequently, we make no representations
regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or
for any other purpose.
�
Agreed-Upon Procedures 
�
On March 22, 2016, representatives
the Company provided us with a computer-generated student loan data file and related record layout containing, as represented to
us by the Company, data as of March 16, 2016, with respect to 2,398 student loans (the �Initial Statistical Loan File�).
Further, on March 27, 2016 representatives of the Company provided us with a supplemental student loan data file containing �borrower
name� and �amount of last payment� information for each of the 2,398 student loans set forth on the Initial Statistical
Loan File (the �Supplemental Loan File�).
�
Representatives of the Company instructed
us to append the Initial Statistical Loan File with the information set forth on the Supplemental Loan File. The Initial Statistical
Loan File, as adjusted, is herein referred to as the �Statistical Loan File.�
�
At your instruction, we randomly selected
100 student loans (the �Sample Loans�) from the Statistical Loan File and performed certain comparisons and recomputations
for each of the Sample Loans relating to the student loan characteristics (the �Characteristics�) set forth on the
Statistical Loan File and indicated below.

We compared Characteristics 2. and

or Approval Disclosure Statement (collectively, the �Originating Documents�) and to an electronic loan file, prepared,
created, and delivered by the Company to us on March 31, 2016, from the Company�s servicing system as of March 16, 2016 (the
�Servicer System File�); Characteristics 4. through 14. to the Servicer System File; Characteristics 15. through 17.

(collectively, the �Income Verification Documentation�) and Characteristics 19. through 21. to the Degree Verified
Certificate, or other related correspondence (collectively, the �Degree Verification Form�).
�
At your instruction, for purposes
of our comparisons:
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 2., a loan type of (i) �refinance�
as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �consolidation� as set forth on the Originating
Documents and (ii) �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �private
education� as set forth on the Originating Documents. Further, a loan type of (i) �refinance� as set forth on
the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �CBGRL� or �CBHBRD� as set forth on the Servicer
System File and (ii) �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with �CBMBA�
and as set forth on the Servicer System File.
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 5., for those Sample Loans
indicated to be �in-school� as set forth on the Statistical Loan File, we were instructed to multiply the original
loan balance as set forth on the Servicer System File by 102% and compare such recomputed amount. Such comparisons were found to
be in agreement;
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 17., if a borrower and co-borrower
credit score were observed on the Credit Report, we compared the higher score; and
�

�with respect to our comparison of Characteristic 18., differences of 2.5%
or less of the borrower income amount indicated on the Statistical Loan File are noted to be in agreement;
�
The student loan documents (including
the Servicer System File) described above and any other related documents used in support of the Characteristics were provided
to us by representatives of the Company and are collectively referred to hereinafter as the �Loan Documents.� We were
not requested to perform, and we did not perform, any procedures with respect to the preparation or verification of any of the
information set forth on the Loan Documents and we make no representations concerning the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information contained therein. In certain instances, procedures were performed using data imaged facsimiles or photocopies of the
Loan Documents. In addition, we make no representations as to whether the Loan Documents are comprehensive or valid instruments
or reflect the current prevailing terms with respect to the corresponding Sample Loans.

Independent Accountants’ Report
on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures




Ladies and Gentlemen:


We have performed the procedures described below, which were agreed to by CommonBond, Inc. (the “Company”) and Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Other Specified Party” and, together with the Company, the “Specified Parties”), related to their evaluation of certain information with respect to a portfolio of student loans in connection with the proposed offering of CommonBond Student Loan Trust 2016-B, Private Credit Student Loan Backed Notes (the “Transaction”).


This agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.  The sufficiency of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the Specified Parties of this report.  Consequently, we make no representations regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.


Agreed-Upon Procedures


On September 7, 2016, representatives the Company provided us with a computer-generated student loan data file and related record layout containing data, as represented to us by the Company, as of August 29, 2016, with respect to 2,131 student loans (the “Statistical Loan File”).  At your instruction, we randomly selected (i) 100 student loans (the “Sample Loans”) from the Statistical Loan File and (ii) an additional 240 student loans, which includes 93 of the 100 Sample Loans, from the Statistical Loan File that were indicated on the Statistical Loan File as being originated by CommonBond Lending LLC (the “Selected Sample Loans”).


File Review Procedures of the Sample Loans:


For each of the Sample Loans, we performed certain comparisons and recomputations relating to the student loan characteristics (the “Sample Loan Characteristics”) set forth on the Statistical Loan File and indicated below.
Sample Loan Characteristics



1.  Loan number (for informational purposes)
2.  Loan type (in-school, refinance)
3.  Borrower state (original)
4.  Original loan balance
5.  Deferment end date (if applicable)
6.  Forbearance end date (if applicable)
7.  Payment amount
8.  First disbursement date
 


9.   Maturity date
10.  Next Payment Date (if applicable)
11.  Current loan status

14.  Borrower graduation year*
15.  Borrower degree program*
 



*For Sample Loans with a loan type of “refinance” only.

We compared Sample Loan Characteristics 2. and 3. to the corresponding information set forth on or derived from the Promissory Note or Approval Disclosure Statement (together, the “Originating Documents”) and to an electronic loan file, prepared, created, and delivered by the Company, from the Company’s servicing system as of the close of business on a specified date (the “Servicer System File”);  Sample Loan Characteristics 4. through 13. to the Servicing System File and Sample Loan Characteristics 14. and 15. to the Degree Verification Form.


At your instruction, for purposes of our comparisons:






·


with respect to our comparison of Sample Loan Characteristic 2., a loan type of (i) “refinance” as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with “consolidation” as set forth on the Originating Documents and (ii) “in-school” as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with “private education” as set forth on the Originating Documents.  Further, a loan type of (i) “refinance” as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with “CBDPCN03,” “CBDPCN02,” “CBDPCN01,” “CBDPCN06,” “CBDPCN04,” “CBDPCN15,” “CBDPCN05,” “CBDPCN07,” “CBDPCN08,” “CBDPCN09,” “CBGRL,” “CBHBRD” and “CBDPCN10” as set forth on the Servicing System File and (ii) “in-school” as set forth on the Statistical Loan File is noted to be in agreement with “CBMBA,” “CBDGRD01” and “CBDGRD15” as set forth on the Servicing System File; and










·


with respect to our comparison of Sample Loan Characteristic 4., for the Sample Loan indicated in Appendix A, we noted a difference with respect to the original loan balance, as set forth on the Statistical Loan File, when compared to the original loan balance, as set forth on the Originating Documents.  For such Sample Loan, we were instructed by the Company to perform an additional procedure and compare the original loan balance set forth on the Statistical Loan File to a screen shot from the Company’s servicing system, provided by representatives of the Company.  Such comparison was found to be “in agreement.”






File Review Procedures of the Selected Loans:


For each of the Selected Loans, we performed certain comparisons and recomputations relating to the student loan characteristics (the “Selected Loan Characteristics”) set forth on the Statistical Loan File and indicated below.


Selected Loan Characteristics



1.  Loan number (for informational purposes)
2.  Borrower credit score
3.  Co-signor credit score (if applicable)
4.  Credit score
 


5.  Borrower income
6.  Free cash flow
7.  Borrower school
 





We compared Selected Loan Characteristics 2. through 4. to the “Credit Report;” Selected Loan Characteristic 5. to a borrower’s pay stub, borrower’s W-2 or other related correspondence (collectively, the “Income Verification Documentation”); Selected Loan Characteristic 6. to an electronic loan file, prepared, created, and delivered by the Company, from the Company’s accounting system (the “Accounting System File”) and Selected Loan Characteristic 7. to the Degree Verified Certificate or other related correspondence (collectively, the “Degree Verification Form”).


At your instruction, for purposes of our comparisons:






·


with respect to our comparison of Selected Loan Characteristic 4., if both a borrower and co-signor credit score is observed on the Credit Report, we compared the co-signor credit score; and




 
 




3

with respect to our comparison of Selected Loan Characteristics 5. and 6., differences of 2.5% or less of the borrower income amount and free cash flow amount indicated on the Statistical Loan File are noted to be “in agreement.”






 
In addition to the procedures described above, for each Selected Loan, we noted that the Credit Report of  the (i) borrower, (if no co-signor is applicable to the Selected Loan, as represented to us by the Company)  or (ii) co-signor (if a co-signor is applicable to the Selected Loan, as represented to us by the Company):
 






a)


included at least two years of credit history;










b)


does not indicate having a “public record code” of “AM,” “CB,” “CJ,” “CP,” “CS,” “DF,” “DS,” “FC,” “DF,” “FF,” “FT,” “GN,” “HA,” “HF,” “HL,” “JL,” “JM,” “LR,” “ML,” “PC,” “PF,” “PG,” “PL,” “PQ,” “PT,” “PV,” “RL,” “RM,” “RS,” “SF,” “SL,” “TB,” “TC,” “TL,” “TP,” “TR,” “TX,” “WS,” “1D,” “1F,” “1V,” “1X,” “2D,” “2F,” “2V,” “2X,” “3D,” “3 F,” “3V,” “3X,” “7D,” “7F,” “7V” or “7X;”










c)


that the “paymentPattern” field does not indicate a “4” or “5” for the most recent 12 payments represented; and










d)


that the “chargeOffRepo” for each tradeline does not contain a “currentBalance” of $500 or more in the last  24 months.






Further, representatives the Company provided us with a computer-generated student loan data file containing the “offer deadline date,” “approval TIL date,” “right to cancel date” and “final TIL date” for each Selected Loan (the “TILA Dates Data File”).  For each Selected Loan, we noted:






·


that the difference between the “offer deadline date” and “approval TIL date,” each as set forth on the TILA Dates Data File, is at least 33 calendar days; and






 




·


that the difference between the “right to cancel date” and “final TIL date,” each as set forth on the TILA Dates Data File, is at least 3 business days.






 
The student loan documents (including the Servicer System File) described above and any other related documents used in support of the Sample Loan Characteristics or Selected Loan Characteristics were provided to us by representatives of the Company and are collectively referred to hereinafter as the “Loan Documents.”  We were not requested to perform, and we did not perform, any procedures with respect to the preparation or verification of any of the information set forth on the Loan Documents and we make no representations concerning the accuracy or completeness of any of the information contained therein.  In some instances, our comparisons and recomputations were made using data imaged facsimiles or photocopies of the Loan Documents.  In addition, we make no representations as to whether the Loan Documents are comprehensive or valid instruments or reflect the current prevailing terms with respect to the corresponding Sample Loans or Selected Loans.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
