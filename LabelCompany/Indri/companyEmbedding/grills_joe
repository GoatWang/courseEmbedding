Grilling Tools & Supplies from Amazon.comWhen the weather gets warmer and the skies clear, it’s a perfect time to relax with a barbeque, and when the skies get cloudy and the cold wind blows, that’s also the perfect time to warm yourself up with some barbeque. Grilling season can last all year thanks to quality grilling supplies from Amazon.comWe feature a wide variety of grilling supplies, including the grills themselves. We have many propane, natural gas grills, and electric-powered grills so you can choose the one that best suits your purposes. Classic charcoal burning grills offer that traditional smoky flavor you grew up with, while our gas and electric grills provide a flavorless heat source, letting your marinades and barbeque sauces take center stage. Wire brushes can also help keep old flavors of last week’s dinner from changing the flavor of your burgers and corn on the cob.For more advanced barbeque masters, we offer smokers, fryers, and Dutch ovens to complete your meat-making arsenal. Smokers come in a variety of shapes and use many different heat sources. You’ll have a lot of fun experimenting with different smoked meats, cheeses, peppers, and more. Dutch ovens are as versatile as any other piece of cooking hardware out there, and can simplify cooking stews, roasts, chilies, and much more. They’re ideal one-pot cookers, which saves on clean-up afterwards.If you’re already happy with your grilling and barbequing setup, we have a variety of grilling accessories and supplies to go with it. We carry everything from essential heavy-duty spatulas, tongs, and forks to high-tech meat thermometers that help you grill the perfect steaks every time. We even have metal or disposable skewers perfect for grilling shrimp, veggies and even marshmallows.Any season is barbeque season thanks to quality grilling supplies from Amazon.com.

THE BEST BBQ MEMORIES ARE MADE BY SHARING WONDERFUL MEALS

Inspired by his passion for grilling the best steaks for family and friends, Weber’s founder, George Stephen, invented the revolutionary kettle grill in 1952.
George knew that a rounded cooking bowl with a lid was the key to success. He added three legs to the bottom, a handle to the top, and the rest is history.

                            Kamado Joe excels in providing the essential grilling accessories to enhance your backyard BBQ experience. Create delicious, restaurant-quality pizza on your Kamado grill with this Kamado Joe pizza stone. This ceramic pizza stone distributes heat evenly while absorbing excess moisture for pizza that comes out hot, full of flavor and with a crispy crust. Use it to bake bread, casseroles and just about anything you bake in an indoor oven. The pizza stone arrives ready to use, and does not need to be seasoned with any type of cooking oil. To clean the pizza stone, simply brush it off with a wire BBQ brush and store in a dry area. Cleaning off residual food is as easy as flipping the ceramic plate over so heat from the charcoal fire burns away any remaining food particles. Cleaning solutions should not be used, since they can be absorbed into the stone. The Pizza Stone must be used with the Kamado Joe Heat Deflector to avoid burning the pizza. This pizza stone is designed for use with Kamado Joe Big Joe grills.
                        


Warranty
                        Kamado Joe warrants this product to be free of defects in material and workmanship for one year.

45 Day No Hassle Returns
We want you to love what you buy! But if you don’t, we offer a simple “No Hassle Returns” policy. We allow you to return all new, unused, unassembled, and resalable items in their original packaging within 45 days of delivery for a refund (minus the original and return shipping costs incurred by BBQGuys.com). Naturally, if your return is because of our error, you are not responsible for any shipping costs.

If your return request is due to product defect or damage, we will first work with you to get the product repaired. If repair is not possible, then we’ll work with you to get it replaced.
If your return will be coming back via freight truck, we will require you to provide us a photo before your return will be authorized. This can be as simple as a cell phone pic! We just need a “before” picture in case there is any damage to the item on its way back to us.
To expedite the returns process, before shipping the item(s) back, make sure they are clean, the packaging is sufficient to prevent damage, and (if necessary) you note all defects along with the photos taken.

Important information about refund eligibility:
To be eligible for a “No Hassle Return,” items must be returned within 45 days of delivery in “Like New” condition. “Like New” condition is when a returned item is unused, unassembled, and has been returned in the original packaging.

Full refunds do not apply to certain items, including clearance items, gift cards, gift certificates, items that have been personalized, and items clearly marked as “non-returnable,” such as products sold as “Warehouse Deals.”
The costs of return shipping are deducted from your refund or merchandise credit.
In many cases, refunds are not processed until the item has been inspected by us in our warehouse.
Refunds must be applied to the same credit card, debit card, or other form of payment used in the original transaction.
In many cases, refunds are not processed until the item is inspected upon return delivery.
BBQGuys.com reserves the right to refuse a refund on a returned item if:
				
The item that has been returned does not match the original item shipped to the customer.
The returned item is missing parts or the original product’s packaging.
The item was damaged during the return shipment due to improper or insufficient packaging.
The item being returned has been obviously heavily used (such as significant charcoal buildup inside a grill).
The item has been assembled in a way that would impede proper packaging for return shipping.



In exchange situations, there are TWO options:

If you need the product right away, you can purchase a replacement on a new order to get it shipped out as soon as possible. Then return the original item and we’ll refund you for the original once we’ve received it back to our warehouse in “Like New” condition.
If you can wait a little longer, return the original item and once we’ve received it back to our warehouse in “Like New” condition, we’ll refund you for that purchase, then have you purchase the replacement on a new order and we’ll ship the replacement as soon as possible.

Custom made-to-order/special order items are made to your specifications. Due to the custom nature of made-to-order/special order items, all sales are final. Made-to-order/special order items defective due to manufacturing will be repaired/replaced as long as the claim is made within the warranty period offered by the manufacturer. Custom pieces damaged in shipping will still follow all steps for a freight claim as previously listed here. All Custom pieces will be repaired or replaced with an item of the same nature as previously ordered. You will not be allowed to order an item that differs from the damaged or defective item.
Feel free to use our simple online form to obtain a Returns Authorization Number (also known as an RMA number) and let us walk you through our 45 Day No Hassle Returns process.



Customer Safety & Security
All purchasing transactions take place over a secure connection. This means that while theoretically someone could be listening to the conversation between your computer and our server, they could not understand it. It is encrypted with the highest standards and latest technologies possible.
Also, our site is checked daily to verify the security of our site and your transactions.
