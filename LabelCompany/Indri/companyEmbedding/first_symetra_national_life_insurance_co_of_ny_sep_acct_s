Fixed Deferred Annuities





Fixed deferred annuities are a popular way to build retirement income through tax-deferred growth, especially if you want to minimize risk.


Growth isn’t tied to market performance. Consider these annuities for the conservative part of your savings plan.
You receive an initial guaranteed interest rate for a specific period of time. At the end of that period, the interest rate is reset, but will not be lower than a guaranteed minimum interest rate established at issue.



SINGLE PREMIUM
Choose from a variety of products offering a guaranteed interest rate for 3, 5 or 7 years, depending on the product selected.
Learn more.

 
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM
Receive guaranteed interest for no less than 1 year, plus you can make additional purchase payments over time.
Learn more.

a __________ corporation ("Broker-Dealer") and ________________________________ 
_____ _______________________________________, a ______________ corporation     
("Insurance Agency").                                                           

RECITALS:   
  A. First Symetra pursuant to distribution agreements with SSI (the
"Distribution Agreements") has appointed SSI as the principal underwriter of    
the class or classes of group and individual variable life insurance and        
annuity contracts identified in Schedule 1 to this Agreement at the time that   
this Agreement is executed, and such other class or classes of variable         
insurance products that may be added to Schedule 1 from time to time in         
accordance with Section 2(f) of this Agreement (each, a "class of Contracts";   
all such classes, the "Contracts").  For the purposes of this Agreement         
(including the schedules), a group life insurance or annuity "enrollment form"  
shall mean the same as the individual "application," "certificate" shall mean   
the same as "contract" and all other group insurance terms shall have the same  
meaning as their individual insurance contract counterpart.  Each class of      
Contracts will be issued by First Symetra through one or more separate          
accounts of First Symetra ("Separate Accounts") and each class of Contracts     
will be funded by shares of certain registered investment companies (each, a    
"Fund"; together, the "Funds") and/or by a fixed account option(s).  First      
Symetra has authorized SSI to enter into separate written agreements with       
broker-dealers pursuant to which such broker-dealers would be authorized to     
participate in the sale of the Contracts.                                       

B. Broker-Dealer is a broker-dealer and Insurance Agency is a life insurance    
agency.  Insurance Agency is (__) an Affiliate of Broker-Dealer; Insurance      
Agency is (___) the same person as Broker-Dealer; or (___) Broker-Dealer        
controls Insurance Agency's securities-related activity by contract.            
C. The parties to this Agreement desire that Broker-Dealer and Insurance        
Agency be authorized to solicit applications for the sale of the Contracts      
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein.

    an insurer.  Insurance Agency must, at all times when performing its
      functions and fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement, be duly
     licensed to sell the Contracts in each state or other jurisdiction in

      of such no action letters and specifically agree that:

(a)     Insurance Agency shall train, supervise, and be solely responsible for  
        the conduct of the Agents in their solicitation activities in connection

   securities laws and regulations, including without limitation state
       insurance laws and regulations imposing insurance licensing requirements.

(d)     Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency each shall carry out their respective
      sales and administrative obligations under this Agreement in continued

P-->EX-36th�Page�of�15TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
(f)     In addition to any other provisions of this Agreement applicable to

 (i)     An Agent shall recommend the purchase of a Contract to an
             applicant only if he or she has reasonable grounds to believe
              that such purchase is suitable for the applicant in accordance
             with, among other things, applicable regulations of any state
     insurance regulatory authority, the SEC and the NASD.

     (ii)    An Agent shall accept initial Premiums in the form of a check
              or money order only if made payable to "First Symetra National
               Life Insurance Company of New York" and signed by the applicant
               for the Contract.  An Agent shall not accept third-party checks

      (iii)   All checks and money orders and applications for the Contracts
           received by an Agent shall be remitted promptly, and in any
          event not later than 2 business days after receipt, to the

        (iv)   An Agent shall not encourage a prospective purchaser to surrender
                or exchange an insurance policy or contract in order to purchase
              a Contract, or conversely, to surrender or exchange a Contract
                in order to purchase another insurance policy or contract unless
            proper state required replacement procedures are adhered to.

(g)     Upon issuance of a Contract, First Symetra shall, in accordance with its
       procedures with respect to each class of Contracts, either deliver such
Contract directly to the purchaser or deliver such Contract to  
 Insurance Agency or the Agent for delivery to the purchaser. Upon
     issuance of a Contract by First Symetra and delivery of such Contract
 to Insurance Agency or the Agent, Insurance Agency shall promptly
 deliver such Contract, or ensure prompt delivery by Agent of such
       Contract, to its purchaser.  Insurance Agency or the Agent shall return
   promptly to First Symetra all receipts for delivered Contracts, all
      undelivered Contracts and all receipts for cancellation, in accordance
with the instructions provided by First Symetra.

       Dealer, rather than to the Service Center, Insurance Agency and Broker-
  Dealer shall promptly (and in any event, not later than 2 business
 days) remit such Premiums to First Symetra at the Service Center.
     Insurance Agency and Broker-Dealer acknowledge that if any Premium is
 held at any time by either of them, such Premium shall be held on
   behalf of the customer, and Insurance Agency or Broker-Dealer shall
    segregate such Premium from their own funds and promptly (and in any
   event, within 2 business days) remit such Premium to First Symetra.
      All such Premiums, whether by check, money order or wire, shall at all
times be the property of First Symetra.                         

(i)     Neither Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency nor any Agent, in connection    
      with the offer or sale of the Contracts, shall give any information or
       make any representations or statements, written or oral, concerning the
Contracts, a Fund or Fund Shares, other than information or

      the Contracts, or a Fund, or in reports or proxy statements therefore,
     or in promotional, sales or advertising material or other information
supplied and approved in writing by First Symetra.

    Agency. Broker-Dealer shall make such books and records available to
  First Symetra at any reasonable time upon written request by First
Symetra.

     pay to Insurance Agency as compensation for Contracts for which it is

   repayment and/or payment under any of the provisions of Schedules 2
      and/or 3 is not promptly made following receipt of a notice of request
     for repayment, Insurance Agency authorizes First Symetra, at its sole
   option and to the extent permitted by applicable law, to deduct any
such unrepaid compensation or unpaid payment from any future    
    compensation owed by First Symetra or any affiliate of First Symetra
   to Insurance Agency as it becomes due; provided, however, that this
      option on the part of First Symetra shall not prevent it from pursuing
        any other means or remedies available to it to recover such compensation
and/or payment.                                                 

(d)     Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency shall immediately remit to First      
   Symetra any premium retained in error by Broker-Dealer or Insurance
Agency.                                                         

7.      Interest in Agreement.  Agents shall have no interest in this Agreement 
    or right to any commissions to be paid by First Symetra to Insurance
     Agency.  Insurance Agency shall be solely responsible for the payment
   of any commission or consideration of any kind to Agents. Insurance
    Agency shall have no right to withhold or deduct any commission from
any Premiums in respect of the Contracts which it may collect.  
   Insurance Agency shall have no interest in any compensation paid by
   First Symetra to SSI, now or hereafter, in connection with the sale
of any Contracts hereunder.                                     

8.      Term of Agreement

        (iii)   if Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency, on the one side, or SSI or
              First Symetra, on the other side, should default in a material
              respect, in their respective obligations under this Agreement,
        or breach in a material respect, any of their respective
              representations or warranties made in this Agreement, any non-
              defaulting or non-breaching party may, at their option, cancel
and terminate this Agreement without notice.    

(c)     Upon termination of this Agreement, all authorizations, rights, and

           payment of compensation with respect to Contracts in effect

          received by First Symetra prior to termination or Premiums
            received on such Contracts subsequent to termination of this
      Agreement provided, however, that if this Agreement is
      terminated by First Symetra or SSI pursuant to Section
              8(b)(iii), First Symetra's obligations under this subparagraph
(i) shall cease upon such termination;          

   (ii)    the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in
Section 13 hereof;                              

P-->EX-39th�Page�of�15TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
    (iii)   the provisions of Sections 4(l) and 4(m) hereof that require
            Insurance Agency and Broker-Dealer to maintain certain books
and records;                                    

      (iv)    the confidentiality provisions contained in Section 11 hereof;

(v)     the audit provisions contained in Section 21; and       

    (vi)    the provisions with respect to complaints and investigations
set forth in Section 9 hereof.                  

9.      Complaints and Investigations                                           

(a)     SSI, First Symetra, Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency each shall       
       cooperate fully in any insurance regulatory investigation or proceeding
        or judicial proceeding arising in connection with the Contracts marketed
     under this Agreement.  In addition, SSI, First Symetra, Broker-Dealer
       and Insurance Agency shall cooperate fully in any securities regulatory
       investigation or proceeding or judicial proceeding with respect to SSI,
    Broker-Dealer, their Affiliates and their agents, to the extent that
    such investigation or proceeding is in connection with the Contracts
    marketed under this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing, each
     party shall promptly notify the other parties of any written customer
    complaint or notice of any regulatory investigation or proceeding or
    judicial proceeding received by such party with respect to any other
   party, any Agent, or in connection with any Contract marketed under
    this Agreement or any activity in connection with any such Contract.

(b)     In the case of a customer complaint, SSI, First Symetra, Broker-Dealer  
       and Insurance Agency will cooperate in investigating such complaint and

      will be sent to First Symetra for approval not less than five business
     days prior to its being sent to the customer or regulatory authority,
except that if a more prompt response is required, the proposed 
response shall be communicated by telephone or facsimile.       

10.     Assignment.  This Agreement shall be nonassignable by the parties       
hereto unless an authorized officer of the non-assigning parties
   agrees to the proposed assignment in writing prior to its effective
date.                                                           

11.     Confidentiality/Security of Information. Each party shall maintain the  
confidentiality of any other party's customer list or any other 
      proprietary information that it may acquire in the performance of this
     Agreement.  Company may furnish Broker-Dealer and/or Insurance Agency
      with personal customer information that is non-public and confidential
      in nature. Except as required in order to perform Broker-Dealer and/or
  Insurance Agency's obligations and duties under this Agreement, to
     perform joint marketing efforts with Company, or as permitted by law,
    Broker-Dealer and/or Insurance Agency shall not use or disclose such
non-public or confidential information received from Company.   

   Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency will maintain and enforce safety
and physical security procedures with respect to its access and 
    maintenance of personal customer information that provide reasonably
      appropriate technical and organizational safeguards against accidental
       or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized disclosure or
  access.  Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency will notify Company of
    any breach of security and use diligent efforts to remedy any breach
     of security or unauthorized access in a timely manner.  Broker-Dealer
     and Insurance Agency agree to cooperate with the Company's efforts to
remedy any breach of security or unauthorized access.           

P-->EX-310th�Page�of�15TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�10th
12.     Modification of Agreement.    This Agreement supersedes all prior       
       agreements, either oral or written, between the parties relating to the
       Contracts or among Broker-Dealer and/or Insurance Agency, First Symetra
    and Symetra Investment Services, Inc., and, except for any amendment
    of Schedule 1 pursuant to the terms of Section 2 hereof or Schedules
2 and/or 3 pursuant to the terms of Section 6 hereof, may not be
    modified in any way unless by written agreement signed by all of the
parties.                                                        

13.     Indemnification                                                         

(a)     Broker-Dealer and Insurance Agency, jointly and severally, shall        
      indemnify and hold harmless First Symetra and each person who controls
    or is associated with First Symetra within the meaning of such terms
      under the federal securities laws, and any officer, director, employee
      or agent of the foregoing, against any and all losses, claims, damages
    or liabilities, joint or several (including any investigative, legal
  and other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with, and any
    amounts paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding or any
      claim asserted), to which they or any of them may become subject under
      any statute or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such
      losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon:

       (i)     violation(s) by Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency, or an Agent of
           federal or state securities law or regulation(s), insurance
             law or regulation(s), or any rule or requirement of the NASD;

  (ii)    any unauthorized use of sales or advertising material, any
         oral or written misrepresentations, or any unlawful sales
     practices concerning the Contracts, by Broker-Dealer,
Insurance Agency or an Agent;                   

  (iii)   claims by the Agents or other agents or representatives of
          Insurance Agency or Broker-Dealer for commissions or other
compensation or remuneration of any type;       

        (iv)    any action or inaction by a clearing broker through whom Broker-
             Dealer or Insurance Agency processes any transaction pursuant
to this Agreement;                              

      (v)     any failure on the part of Broker-Dealer, Insurance Agency, or
             an Agent to submit Premiums or applications to First Symetra,
               or to submit the correct amount of a Premium, on a timely basis
       and in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement;  or

      (vi)    a breach by Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency of any provision
of this Agreement.                              
This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which Broker-Dealer   
and Insurance Agency may otherwise have.                                        

(b)     First Symetra shall indemnify and hold harmless Broker-Dealer and       
   Insurance Agency and each person who controls or is associated with
  Broker-Dealer or Insurance Agency within the meaning of such terms
under the federal securities laws, and any officer, director,   
employee or agent of the foregoing, against any and all losses, 
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several (including any 
investigative, legal and other expenses reasonably incurred in  
   connection with, and any amounts paid in settlement of, any action,
  suit or proceeding or any claim asserted), to which they or any of
  them may become subject under any statute or regulation, at common
law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or    
liabilities arise out of or are based upon:                     

   (i)     any breach by SSI or First Symetra of any provision of this
Agreement;                                      

P-->EX-311th�Page�of�15TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
(ii)    any untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
               Registration  Statement or Prospectus relating to any Contract;

       (iii)   the omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated
        therein or  necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading;                                     

    (iv)    violation(s) by First Symetra of federal or state securities
            law or regulation(s), insurance law or regulation(s), or any
rule or requirement of the NASD; or             

 (v)     any breach of a fiduciary duty owed by First Symetra to a
contractholder  with respect to a Contract.     
This indemnification will be in addition to any liability which First Symetra   
may otherwise have.                                                             

(c)     After receipt by a party entitled to indemnification ("indemnified      
  party") under this Section 13 of notice of the commencement of any
      action, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any person
obligated to provide indemnification under this Section 13      
("indemnifying party"), such indemnified party will notify the  
    indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof as soon as
   practicable thereafter, provided that the omission to so notify the
    indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability under this
Section 13, except to the extent that the omission results in a 
failure of actual notice to the indemnifying party and such     
  indemnifying party is damaged solely as a result of the failure to
  give such notice.  The indemnifying party, upon the request of the
      indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
       indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the
     indemnifying party may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the
      fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding.  In
  any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to
       retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall
       be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying
 party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such 
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the   
       indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
   parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
   potential differing interests between them.  The indemnifying party
 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected
   without its written consent, but if such proceeding is settled with
   such consent or if final judgment is entered in such proceeding for
     the plaintiff, the indemnifying party shall indemnify the indemnified
party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such  
settlement or judgment.                                         

14.     Rights, Remedies, etc., are Cumulative.  The rights, remedies and       
 obligations contained in this Agreement are cumulative and are in
   addition to any and all rights, remedies and obligations, at law or
   in equity, which the parties hereto are entitled to under state and
      federal laws. Failure of a party to insist upon strict compliance with
   any of the conditions of this Agreement shall not be construed as a
  waiver of any of the conditions, but the same shall remain in full
       force and effect.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement
       shall be deemed, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other provisions,
    whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.

and supersedes all prior oral or written understandings, agreements or          
negotiations between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

of any provision of this Agreement.  This Agreement shall be construed and its

19. Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts,  
each of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.      

20. Severability.  This is a severable Agreement.  In the event that any        
provision of this Agreement would require a party to take action prohibited by  
applicable federal or state law or prohibit a party from taking action required 
by applicable federal or state law, then it is the intention of the parties     
hereto that such provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted under the  
law, and, in any event, that all other provisions of this Agreement shall       
remain valid and duly enforceable as if the provision at issue had never been   
a part hereof.                                                                  

21. Audit of Records. To the extent not otherwise provided herein, each party   
hereto (the "Requesting Party") shall have the right at its expense, upon       
reasonable notice to any other party hereto (the "Other Party"), during regular 
business hours, to audit all the records and practices of the Other Party       
relating to the business contemplated hereunder in order to determine whether   
such Other Party is complying with the terms of this Agreement, including the   
payment of commissions and fees.  The Requesting Party shall have the right to  
copy any of such records at its expense. At its option, such audit may be       
conducted by the Requesting Party's own personnel or by a qualified independent 
auditor selected by it. The Requesting Party shall make reasonable efforts to   
conduct each such audit in a manner that avoids any material disruption of the  
Other Party's business.

THE CONTRACT            First Symetra and you, the Owner, where we              
               promise to pay an income in the form of annuity
              payments, beginning on the date you select, or
               a death benefit.  When you are investing money,
           your Contract is in the Accumulation Phase.
          Once you begin receiving annuity payments,
     your Contract is in the Income Phase.

            You purchased this Contract with the initial
           Purchase Payment you paid, and the Contract
               became effective on the contract date, shown on
            your contract data page. The minimum initial
          and subsequent Purchase Payments are shown
on the contract data page.      

                 The Contract is called a variable annuity because
               you allocate money among Sub-accounts available
            within the Separate Account.  The investment
            performance of the Sub-account(s) you select
           may be positive or negative and affects the
            value of your Contract and the amount of any
variable annuity payments.      

OWNER                   The Owner is shown on the application, unless           
              changed.  On the contract date, the Owner must
          not have been older than the maximum issue
         age shown on the contract data page.  The
       Owner may exercise all ownership rights
under this Contract.            

               If this Contract is owned by joint Owners, they
             must jointly exercise their ownership rights,
              unless we are directed otherwise by both joint
              Owners in writing.  On the contract date, each
             joint Owner must not have been older than the
            maximum issue age shown on the contract data
           page.  An Owner who is a non-natural person
           (for example, a corporation or a trust) may
not name a joint Owner.         

          You may change the Owner or joint Owner by
              sending us a signed and dated request.  If you
            designate someone else as Owner, that person
         must not have been older than the maximum
          issue age on the contract date. Unless you
           specify otherwise, a change in ownership is
              effective as of the date you signed the notice
          of change, subject to any payments made or
           actions we may take prior to receipt of the
notice.                         

ANNUITANT               The Annuitant is/are the person(s) on whose             
               life/lives annuity payments are based.  You are
          the Annuitant unless you designate someone
               else before the Annuity Date.  If you designate
           someone else as Annuitant, that person must
          not be older than the maximum issue age on
 the contract date and the maximum
              annuitization age when annuity payments begin.
     The maximum issue age and the maximum
           annuitization age are shown on the contract
data page.                      

        An Owner who is a non-natural person may
not change the Annuitant.

BENEFICIARY             The Beneficiary receives any death benefit              
            payable in accordance with the provisions of
       this Contract.  You initially name your
          Beneficiaries on the contract application.

Change of Beneficiary   You may change your Beneficiary designation at          
         any time by sending us a signed and dated
               request.  However, if a Beneficiary designation
                is irrevocable, that Beneficiary must consent in
         writing to any change.  A new Beneficiary
                designation revokes any prior designation and is
              effective when signed by the Owner. We are not
               responsible for the validity of any Beneficiary
           designation nor for any actions we may take
              prior to receiving and recording a Beneficiary
change.

PURCHASE PAYMENT PROVISIONS                                                     
----------------------------------------------------------------------          

PURCHASE                During the Accumulation Phase, you may make             
PAYMENTS               additional Purchase Payments.  You may change          
              the amount and frequency of Purchase Payments.
           The minimum dollar amounts are shown on the
                contract data page.  If you stop making Purchase
                   Payments, all benefits under this Contract continue
                 until the contract value is completely withdrawn.

               Purchase Payments must be in lawful currency of
      the United States and submitted to our
                    Administrative Office at [P.O. Box 3882, Seattle, WA
98124-3882], or in a manner agreed to by First
Symetra.                        

                 We reserve the right to reject any application by
                an Owner or Annuitant who is ineligible for this
                  Contract, any incomplete application, any Purchase
       Payment which does not meet the minimum
         payment amount shown on the contract data
              page, and any Purchase Payment in excess of $1
                million dollars.  If we do not accept a Purchase
               Payment, we will return it within five business
days.                           

ALLOCATION OF           Your initial Purchase Payment will be allocated         
PURCHASE PAYMENTS       according to your instructions on your application.     
        Unless you tell us otherwise, subsequent
               Purchase Payments will be allocated in the same
       proportion as your most recent Purchase
           Payment (unless that was a Purchase Payment
              you directed us to allocate on a one-time-only
basis).                         

          Once we receive your Purchase Payment, the
                    allocation to the Portfolios is effective and valued
          as of the next close of the New York Stock
               Exchange (NYSE).  If for any reason the NYSE is
             closed when we receive your Purchase Payment,
                it will be valued as of the close of the NYSE on
its next regular business day.  

             When we are required to guarantee a return of
             Purchase Payments during the Right to Examine
               period, we reserve the right to initially apply
                 amounts to the [Fidelity VIP Money Market Initial
         Class] as shown on the cover page of this
               Contract.  These amounts will then be allocated
           in the manner you selected, unless you have
canceled the Contract.          

ACCUMULATION            When you make Purchase Payments or transfers into a     
UNITS                   Sub-account, we credit your Contract with               
                  Accumulation Units.  Similarly, when you request a
             withdrawal or a transfer of money from a Sub-
               account, Accumulation Units are liquidated.  In
            either case, the increase or decrease in the
    number of your Accumulation Units is
             determined by taking the dollar amount of the
         Purchase Payment, transfer, or withdrawal
               and dividing it by the value of an Accumulation
        Unit on the date the transaction occurs.

              We calculate the value of an Accumulation Unit
                  for each Portfolio after the NYSE closes each day.
          To determine the current Accumulation Unit
                value, we take the prior day's Accumulation Unit
           value and multiply it by the Net Investment
Factor for the current day.     

P-->EX-49th�Page�of�29TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
            The Net Investment Factor is used to measure
               the daily change in Accumulation Unit value for
            each Sub-account.  The Net Investment Factor
equals:                         
               -       the net asset value per share of a Sub-
                     account at the end of the current day
                plus the per share amount of any
                     dividend or income distributions made
                    by the Sub-account that day; divided
by              
          -       the net asset value per share of a
                   Sub-account at the end of the prior
                    day plus the per share amount of any
                     dividend or income distributions made
                  by the Sub-account that day; minus
              -       the daily insurance charges, expressed
                       as a percentage of the total net assets
   of the Sub-account.

                      The value of an Accumulation Unit will
                      usually go up or down from day to day.

INVESTMENT OPTIONS                
-----------------------------------------------------------------------         
SUB-ACCOUNTS            You may allocate money to the Sub-accounts              
shown on the contract data page.
     We reserve the right to add, combine,
      restrict, or remove any Sub-account as
      an investment option of this Contract.
      Sub-accounts have different investment
      objectives. The investment performance
   of a Sub-account may be positive or
negative.                       

Substitution of Shares  If any shares of the Sub-accounts are                   
      no longer available, or if in our view
 no longer meet the purpose of the
Contract, it may be necessary to
 substitute shares of another Sub-
     account.  We will seek prior approval
of the Securities and Exchange  
       Commission (SEC) to the extent required
 by law and give you notice before
doing this.                     

CONTRACT VALUE          Your contract value is the sum of the                   
       values in the Sub-accounts attributable
        to your Contract.  We calculate this by:
-       adding all the Purchase 
        Payments you invested;
     -       subtracting the charges which
   have been deducted;
   -       subtracting the withdrawals
you have made;  
-       adjusting for each Sub- 
       account's gain or loss;
-       subtracting the amounts 
        withdrawn for an annuity
option; and     
-       subtracting the amounts 
          withdrawn to pay the death
benefit.        

TRANSFERS               During the Accumulation Phase, you can                  
    transfer money among the Portfolios.
The minimum amounts that can be 
     transferred are shown on the contract
   data page.  In each Contract Year a
         specified number of transfers are free of
      charge.  Each additional transfer in a
 Contract Year may have a transfer
     charge.  The number of free transfers
    and the transfer charge are shown on
the contract data page.         

        We reserve the right to modify, suspend,
       or terminate transfer privileges at any
   time if they violate the provisions
    outlined in the "Limits on Excessive
    Transfers" section of this Contract.

Limits on Excessive     We may restrict or eliminate the right                  
Transfers               to make transfers among Sub-accounts                    
     if such rights are executed by you, a
        market timing firm, or other third party
   authorized to initiate transfers or
     exchange transactions on your behalf.
    For example, we reserve the right to
      reject any transfer request if, in our
judgment, you are engaging in a 
pattern of transfer that may    
  disadvantage other contract owners
or would cause a Portfolio to be
unable to invest effectively in 
accordance with its investment  
objectives and policies or would
  otherwise be potentially adversely
    affected.  In addition, if we or any
   affected Portfolio believes you are
 engaging in activity as described
    above or similar activity which will
        potentially hurt the rights or interests
 of other contract owners, we have
   the right to restrict the number of
transfers you make.             

        We will continue to monitor the transfer
 activity occurring among the Sub-
accounts and may modify these   
       transfer restrictions at any time if we
deem it necessary to protect the
       interest of all contract owners.  These
       modifications may include curtailing or
    eliminating, without notice, certain
methods to request transfers.   
       Portfolios offered in this Contract may
     have their own market timing policies
    and procedures and impose redemption
        fees for short-term investments in their
       Portfolios. We have the right to deduct
those redemption fees from your 
contract value.

CHARGES           
---------------------------------------------------------------------------     

The following charges apply to your Contract:                                   

INSURANCE CHARGES       Each day we make deductions for our                     
      insurance charges.  We do this as part
  of our calculation of the value of
     Accumulation Units and Annuity Units.
     The insurance charges are as follows:

Mortality and Expense   The mortality and expense risk charge                   
Risk Charge             is equal, on an annual basis, to a                      
             percentage of the average daily net assets of
            each Sub-account.  The percentage is shown
on the contract data page.      

Asset-Related           The asset-related administration charge is              
Administration Charge   equal, on an annual basis, to a percentage              
            of the average daily net assets of each Sub-
          account.  The percentages are shown on the
contract data page.             

          The asset-related administration charge is
              determined at the start of each Contract Year.
             The contract value at the start of a Contract
            Year determines the applicable asset-related
        administration charge. The asset-related
             administration charge applies for the current
           Contract Year. The applicable charge may go
      up or down based on market conditions,
             deposits, withdrawals, and surrenders. It may
       be different for each Contract and each
Contract Year.                  

ANNUAL ADMINISTRATION   The annual administration maintenance charge,           
MAINTENANCE CHARGE      shown on the contract data page,                        
               will be deducted from your Contract on the last
             day of each Contract Year and if you withdraw
           the entire contract value.  The Sub-account
     from which this charge is deducted is
           determined by the hierarchical order of the
       Sub-accounts shown on the contract data
page.                           

               We will not deduct this charge if your contract
              value is at least equal to the amount shown on
            the contract data page when the deduction is
             to be made.  During the Income Phase, we will
not deduct this charge.         

SURRENDER CHARGE        A surrender charge may be applied to any                
           withdrawal from the Contract. The surrender
               charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn.
              The surrender charge is based on the length of
           time each Purchase Payment has been in your
               Contract according to the schedule shown on the
              contract data page. We treat Purchase Payments
                  as being withdrawn on a first in, first out basis.
              For purposes of applying the surrender charge,
        all withdrawals are assumed to come from
Purchase Payments first.        

           You can withdraw 10% of your contract value
              each Contract Year without a surrender charge.
          The determination of whether more than 10%
           of the contract value has been withdrawn is
               made at the time of surrender. If you take more
           than one withdrawal in a Contract Year, the
             previous withdrawals in the Contract Year are
                added to the current contract value to determine
           whether more than 10% of the contract value
         has been withdrawn in that Contract Year.

P-->EX-412th�Page�of�29TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�12th
             Surrender charges will not be assessed on the
following:                      

        -       withdrawals, if the total amount
                       withdrawn during the Contract Year does
                     not exceed 10% of the contract value;
        -       withdrawals taken for payment of
                     the annual administration maintenance
                    charge, withdrawal charges, transfer
          charges, or premium taxes;
                  -       repetitive withdrawals, if the withdrawals
                        are equal or substantially equal and are
                           expected to deplete the contract value over
                      your life expectancy or the joint life
                      expectancy of you and your joint Owner
                             (or, if applicable you and your Beneficiary).
                               If you take additional withdrawals or otherwise
                          modify or stop the repetitive withdrawals,
                         however, the repetitive withdrawals taken
                         during the Contract Year will be included
                      when determining whether more than 10%
                         of the contract value has been withdrawn;
-       annuity payments; and   
            -       withdrawals taken on account of your
death.          

WAIVER OF          Surrender charges will also not be assessed on the following:
SURRENDER               -       withdrawals taken after you have been           
CONFINEMENT:                    confined to a hospital or nursing home for      
CHARGES UPON                   30 consecutive days if the withdrawal is taken:
PROVISIONS AND                  -       during confinement; or                  
RESTRICTIONS                    -       within 60 days after confinement ends.  

                 The 30-day period may be satisfied by confinement
                in a combination of hospitals, nursing homes, or
          home care. Separate periods of confinement
           occurring within 6 months of the start of a
     previous 30 consecutive day period of
             confinement for the same or related condition
        will be considered the same confinement.

               A new 30 consecutive day period will be applied
             for a confinement due to a new or non-related
             cause or to a confinement occurring more than
           six months from the most recent confinement
  for the same or related condition.

                 If you are confined to a hospital or nursing home
                   on the contract date, you are not eligible for this
           waiver of surrender charges until after the
first Contract Year.            

              We may require proof of confinement.  Proof of
                confinement may include a billing statement from
              the hospital or nursing home showing the dates
                of confinement and service or a certification of
    confinement signed by your attending
physician.                      

       Hospital is defined in one of two ways:
               (1)     a lawfully operated institution that is
                   licensed as a hospital by the Joint
              Commission of Accreditation of
Hospitals; or   
            (2)     a lawfully operated institution that
                   provides in-patient treatment under
                      the direction of a staff of physicians
               and has 24-hour per day nursing
services.       

              Nursing home is defined as a facility operated
                pursuant to state law that provides convalescent
                 or chronic care for in-patients who, by reason of
                 illness or infirmity, are unable to properly care
for themselves.

          Physician means a health care practitioner
                  licensed, board certified or board eligible in the
               state of New York, who is qualified to practice
         in the area of medicine or in a specialty
             appropriate to treat the Owner's condition or
           disease. It does not include the Owner, the
          Annuitant, or a member of the Owner'(s) or
Annuitant'(s) family.           

             Home care means the care and treatment of the
              Owner who is under the care of a physician but
                 only if confinement in a hospital or nursing home
         would otherwise have been required f home
            care was not provided. The plan covering the
           home health service must be established and
               approved in writing by the attending physician.

WITHDRAWAL CHARGE       The withdrawal charge, shown on the contract            
          data page, is deducted for each withdrawal
              after the first withdrawal in a Contract Year.
      This charge will be deducted from your
            remaining contract value, unless you tell us
otherwise.                      

          We will not deduct this charge for annuity
                 payments, repetitive withdrawals using electronic
               funds transfer (EFT), or if the entire contract
value is withdrawn.             

TRANSFER CHARGE         The transfer charge is deducted from your Contract      
                 for each transfer in excess of the number of free
                   transfers allowed in a Contract Year.  The transfer
                 charge and the number of free transfers are shown
on the contract data page.      

                  Scheduled transfers authorized by us as part of an
                  investment strategy such as dollar cost averaging,
               appreciation sweep, Sub-account rebalancing, or
              asset allocation programs do not count against
your free transfers.            

PREMIUM TAXES           The contract data page shows whether or not             
              premium tax is charged in your state as of the
contract date.                  

INCOME OR OTHER TAXES   Currently we do not pay income or other taxes           
          on earnings attributable to your Contract.
                However, if we ever incur such taxes, we reserve
            the right to deduct them from your Contract.

WITHDRAWAL PROVISIONS       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------      

WITHDRAWALS             During the Accumulation Phase, you may withdraw         
                part or all of your contract value.  The minimum
            amount that can be withdrawn is shown on the
contract data page.             

            To take withdrawals, you must send a written
             request to our Administrative Office.  Unless
                    you tell us differently, partial withdrawals will be
          made pro rata from each Sub-account.  Once
             we receive your request, withdrawals from the
             Sub-accounts will be effective as of the next
close of the NYSE.              

           A withdrawal may have a surrender charge, a
           withdrawal charge, and, if you withdraw the
               entire contract value, an annual administration
maintenance charge.             

Repetitive Withdrawals  You may request repetitive withdrawals of a             
             predetermined amount on a monthly, quarterly,
             or annual basis by completing the appropriate
form.

ANNUITY PAYMENT PROVISIONS        
-------------------------------------------------------------------------       

ANNUITY OPTIONS         The Income Phase will start no later than the           
      maximum annuitization age shown on the
                  contract data page, or an earlier date if required
           by law.  During the Income Phase, the payee
            (you or someone you choose) receives regular
         annuity payments beginning on the Annuity
Date.                           

             To start the Income Phase, you must notify us
                  in writing at least 30 days prior to the date that
            you want annuity payments to begin.  You may
        choose annuity payments under an annuity
            option described in this Contract or another
              annuity option that you want and that we agree
             to provide. You cannot start the Income Phase
                  until the Contract has been in effect for at least
             one year. If the amount applied to an annuity
       option is less than $2,000, we may make
        payment in a lump sum where permitted by
              state law.  We reserve the right to change the
          payment frequency if payment amounts would
be less than $250.              

             Switching to the Income Phase is irrevocable.
              Once you begin receiving annuity payments, you
             cannot switch back to the Accumulation Phase.
           You cannot add Purchase Payments, change or
               add an Annuitant, change the annuity option, or
         change between fixed and variable annuity
             payments.   When the Contract switches to the
          Income Phase, the guaranteed minimum death
     benefit will no longer be applicable.

         The annuity benefits at the time of their
             commencement will not be less than those that
                are provided by the application of the amount to
           purchase any single consideration immediate
                annuity contract offered by First Symetra at the
          same time to the same class of annuitants.

              Annuity payment options based on a life ensure
               that the annuitant or annuitants cannot outlive
          the annuity payments.  The duration of the
               annuitant's life or annuitants lives determines
              how long payments continue under the following
options:                        

Life Annuity            The payee receives monthly annuity payments             
            as long as the Annuitant is living.  Annuity
      payments stop when the Annuitant dies.

Life Annuity with       The payee receives monthly annuity payments             
Guaranteed Period      for the longer of the Annuitant's life or              
            a guaranteed period of five or more years as
            selected by you and agreed to by us.  If the
             Annuitant dies before all guaranteed payments
          have been made, the remaining payments due
           will be made to the payee designated by the
              Owner.  Annuity payments stop the later of the
            date the Annuitant dies or the date the last
guaranteed payment is made.     

          As an alternative to monthly payments, the
            Owner may elect to have the present value of
        the guaranteed variable annuity payments
               remaining as of the date the notice of death is
      received by us commuted at the assumed
            investment return of 4% and paid in a single
payment.                        

Joint and Survivor Life The payee receives monthly annuity payments as          
Annuity                 long as the Annuitant is living.  After the             
              Annuitant dies, the payee receives a specified
             percentage of each annuity payment as long as
                  the joint Annuitant is living.  You name the joint
            Annuitant and payment percentage at the time
             you elect this option.  Annuity payments stop
               the later of the date the Annuitant dies or the
date the joint Annuitant dies.  

P-->EX-416th�Page�of�29TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
Automatic Option        If you do not choose an annuity option at least 30      
                 days before the latest Annuity Date allowed under
            this Contract, we will make variable annuity
               payments under the Life Annuity with Guaranteed
             Period annuity option.  The guaranteed period
           will be equal to 10 years, unless otherwise
required by the IRC.            

ANNUITY PAYMENTS        You can choose whether annuity payments will be         
               made on a fixed basis, variable basis, or both.
          After the Annuity Date, you may not switch
           between fixed annuity payments and variable
annuity payments.               

Fixed Annuity Payments  The dollar amount of each fixed annuity                 
              payment will stay the same.   Annuity payments
           will be determined by applying the contract
            value that you want to use to purchase fixed
              annuity payments to the Fixed Annuity Purchase
                 Rate Table of this Contract, or the current rates
                  at that time if more favorable to you.  If premium
                 taxes are required by state law, these taxes will
           be deducted before the annuity payments are
calculated.                     

Variable Annuity        The dollar amount of each variable annuity              
Payments                payment will vary depending on the investment           
        performance of the Sub-accounts that you
                   selected. Unless we receive different instructions,
              variable annuity payments will be based on the
              investment allocations in place on the Annuity
        Date.  Variable annuity payments will be
determined as described below.  

          First Variable Annuity Payment: The dollar
               amount of the first variable annuity payment is
             the sum of the payments from each Sub-account
              determined by applying the contract value used
                to purchase variable annuity payments, as of the
                15th day of the preceding month, to the Variable
                 Annuity Purchase Rate Table of this Contract.  If
                  the NYSE is not open on that date, the calculation
             will be made on the next day that the NYSE is
             open.  If premium taxes are required by state
            law, these taxes will be deducted before the
annuity payment is calculated.  

                Subsequent Variable Annuity Payments: The dollar
          amount of each subsequent variable annuity
                 payment is the sum of the payments from each Sub-
                account, which are determined by multiplying the
                   number of Annuity Units credited for that Portfolio
                   by the Annuity Unit value of that Sub-account as of
                    the 15th of the month preceding the annuity payment.
                     If the NYSE is not open on that date, the calculation
                   will be made on the next day that the NYSE is open.

                     Number of Variable Annuity Units: The
                    number of Annuity Units credited for
                     each Sub-account is the amount of the
                     first annuity payment attributable to
                     that Sub-account divided by the value
                       of the applicable Annuity Unit for that
                 Sub-account as of the 15th day of
                     the month preceding the Annuity Date.
                   The number of Annuity Units used to
                      calculate the variable annuity payment
                  each month remains constant unless
                 you change Sub-account elections.

P-->EX-417th�Page�of�29TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
                    Value of Variable Annuity Units: The
                     value of an Annuity Unit will usually
             increase or decrease from one
                  month to the next.  For each month
                   after the first month, the value of
               an Annuity Unit of a particular
Sub-account is: 
                 -       the value of that Annuity
                            Unit as of the 15th day of
                       the preceding month (or
                          the next day that the NYSE
         is open);
             -       multiplied by the Net
                           Investment Factors for that
                Sub-account; and
              -       divided by the Assumed
                     Investment Factor for
           the period.

                     The Net Investment Factor is a number
                 that represents the change in the
                        Accumulation Unit value of a Sub-account
                   on successive days when the NYSE is
                        open.  The Net Investment Factor for any
                    Sub-account for any valuation day is
                  determined by dividing the current
                    Accumulation Unit value by the prior
                   day's Accumulation Unit value.  The
                    Net Investment Factor will likely be
                     different than the Assumed Investment
                      Factor, and therefore the Annuity Unit
              value will usually increase or
decrease.       

                   The Assumed Investment Factor for a
                       one-day valuation period is 1.00010746.
                   This factor neutralizes the assumed
              investment return of 4% in the
              Variable Annuity Purchase Rate
Table.          

           We guarantee that the dollar amount of each
             variable annuity payment made after the first
         payment will not be adversely affected by
            variations in actual mortality experience or
                 actual expenses incurred in excess of the expense
        deductions provided for in the Contract.

Changing Sub-account    If you have selected variable annuity payments,         
Elections after         after the Annuity Date you may request to change        
the Annuity Date        Sub-account elections once a month. Changes             
                 will affect the number of units used to calculate
annuity payments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------         
DEATH BENEFIT PROVISIONS            
-----------------------------------------------------------------------         

DEATH OF ANNUITANT      If the Annuitant is not an Owner and the                
Prior to the Annuity    Annuitant dies before the Annuity Date,                 
Date                    you must designate a new Annuitant.  If no              
           designation is made within 30 days after we
               are notified of the Annuitant's death, you will
become the Annuitant.           

                 If this Contract is owned by a non-natural person
                (for example, a corporation or trust), the death
                of the Annuitant will be treated as the death of
                   the Owner.  In this case, all references to "Owner"
                  and "joint Owner" in these provisions are replaced
     by "Annuitant" and "joint Annuitant".

DEATH OF OWNER          If any Owner dies before the Annuity Date, we will      
Prior to the Annuity    pay a death benefit to the:                             
Date                    -       surviving Owner; or if none, then               
              -       surviving primary Beneficiary(ies); or
if none, then   
              -       surviving contingent Beneficiary(ies);
or if none, then
            -       the estate of the last Owner to die.

              If the death benefit is payable to the Owner's
          spouse, the spouse will have the option to
          continue the Contract and will then be the
Owner of the Contract.          

Guaranteed              The guaranteed minimum death benefit is                 
Minimum Death           initially equal to the first Purchase Payment.          
Benefit                 It is immediately increased by additional Purchase      
        Payments and proportionately reduced for
         withdrawals.  After such withdrawals, the
        guaranteed minimum death benefit will be
                recalculated by multiplying the prior guaranteed
                  minimum death benefit by the ratio of the contract
                value after the withdrawal to the contract value
before the withdrawal.          

Calculation of          If the Owner or older joint Owner is under age          
Death Benefit           75 at the time of death, the death benefit on the       
calculation date is the sum of: 
(1)     the contract value; plus
            (2)     any excess of the guaranteed minimum
                      death benefit over the contract value.

              If the Owner is age 75 or older at the time of
                death, the death benefit is the  contract value.

              The guaranteed minimum death benefit is always
                    calculated on the life of the oldest original Owner,
                       as shown on the original application for this Contract.
            The amount payable on the death of any Owner
                other than the oldest original Owner will be the
               current contract value.  If the oldest original
            Owner ceases to be an Owner of the Contract,
            the guaranteed minimum death benefit will be
terminated.                     

       When determining (1) and (2) above, the
         calculations are based on the earlier of:
                  -       the date we receive proof of death and the
                       first election of how to take the death
   benefit payment; or
          -       six months from the date of death.

                    If we receive due proof of death and the first death
                    benefit payment election within 6 months of the date
                  of death:  If the guaranteed minimum death benefit
           exceeds the contract value, we will add the
               difference to the contract value on the date we
                     receive the required information so that the contract
                      value will equal the guaranteed minimum death benefit.
                    This additional amount will be allocated to the Sub-
                      accounts in the same proportion that Purchase Payments
                    were last allocated.  Thereafter, the contract value
             will be subject to investment performance and
                   applicable charges until the date the death benefit
is paid.                        

                    If we receive due proof of death and the first death
                     benefit payment election more than 6 months after the
                       date of death:  If the guaranteed minimum death benefit
                     exceeds the contract value on the 6-month anniversary
                   of the date of death, we will credit the difference
                   with interest at the currently offered money market
                   Sub-account rate from the 6-month anniversary until
                      the date we receive the required information.  At that
                  time we will allocate this additional amount, with
                    the credited interest, to the Portfolios in the same
                      proportion that Purchase Payments were last allocated.
                 Thereafter, the contract value will be subject to
              investment performance and applicable contract
       charges until the date payment is made.

Limitation on           At most, one guaranteed minimum death benefit will      
Death Benefit           be paid during the life of the Contract.In addition,    
                   the maximum amount that we will add to the contract
                        value is limited to $1 million.  This limitation applies
                     to any amount added to the contract value so that the
                  contract value equals the guaranteed minimum death
benefit.                        

Payment of Death        To pay the death benefit, we need proof of death        
Benefit                 acceptable to us, such as a certified copy of a death   
                    certificate, plus written direction regarding how to
                    pay the death benefit payment.  If the death benefit
                    is payable to an Owner's estate, we will pay it in a
single payment.                 

                Upon receiving due proof of death we will credit
     interest at the rate required by law.

 The death benefit may be paid as:
                   -       a lump sum payment or series of withdrawals
                         that are completed within five years from
     the date of death; or
               -       annuity payments made over life or life
                         expectancy.  To receive annuity payments,
                         this election must be made within 60 days
                            from our receipt of proof of death.  Annuity
                            payments must begin within one year from the
                            date of death.  Once annuity payments begin,
       they cannot be changed.

                    If a person entitled to receive a death benefit dies
                    before the death benefit is distributed, we will pay
                        the death benefit to that person's named beneficiary or,
 if none, to that person's estate.

DEATH OF ANNUITANT      If the Annuitant is not the Owner and dies after the    
On or After the         Annuity Date, then we will continue paying any remaining
Annuity Date            annuity payments to the payee designated by the Owner.  

DEATH OF OWNER          If the Owner dies after the Annuity Date, any amounts   
On or After the         paid will depend on the annuity option then in effect.  
Annuity Date            The right to change the payee for remaining annuity     
  payments is determined as follows:
             -       the surviving Owner; or if none, then
                     -       the surviving primary Beneficiary(ies); or if
none, then      
                     -       the surviving contingent Beneficiary(ies); or
if none, then   
            -       the estate of the last Owner to die.

THE CONTRACT            The entire Contract between you and First Symetra       
                  consists of this Contract, contract data page, any
                endorsements, amendments or riders, and contract
               application, a copy of which is attached to the
Contract.                       

                    All statements made by or under the authority of the
                    applicant for issuance of the contract are deemed to
      be representations and not warranties.

                The terms and conditions of this Contract may be
                      amended by written endorsement or amendment and signed
                     by an authorized officer of First Symetra. Any change
                     must be in writing. No other person can change any of
                        the terms or conditions of this Contract.  First Symetra
                   reserves the right to change the provisions of this
                      Contract to conform to any applicable law, regulation,

VOTING RIGHTS           First Symetra is the legal owner of the Portfolios'     
                      shares.  However, when a Portfolio solicits proxies in
                      connection with a shareholder vote, we are required to
                        ask you for instructions as to how to vote those shares.
                  All shares are voted in the same proportion as the
                      instructions we received.  Should we determine that we
                   are no longer required to comply with the above, we
                      will vote the shares in our own right. In addition, we
              may disregard shareholder voting instructions:

                   -       if required by regulatory officials if such
                         instructions would require us to vote the
                      shares so as to cause a change in sub-
                          classification or investment objectives of
                            one or more of the Portfolios, or to approve
                               or disapprove an investment advisory agreement;
                     -       if such instructions would require changes in
                              the investment objective or investment advisor
                          of a Portfolio or be inconsistent with the
                     investment objectives of a Portfolio;
                   -       vary from the general quality and nature of
                          investments and investment techniques used
                           by other Portfolios with similar investment
                        objectives and underlying other variable
                             contracts offered by First Symetra Life or of
                   an affiliated insurance company; or
     -       violate state or federal law.

                   If we disregard voting instructions, we will notify
                 contract owners of our actions and of our reasons
            for doing so in our next semi-annual report.

MORTALITY TABLE USED: The rates in the Variable Annuity Purchase Rate Table are based upon the Annuity                   
2000 Mortality Table projected using a generational approach with an initial projection of 20 years. An age              
setback of 1 year will be used if the annuity payments begin in the year 2013-2022, 2 years if the annuity               
payments begin in the year 2023-2032, and an additional 1-year setback for each additional 10 years. The                 
assumed investment return in the table is 4.00%.                                                                         

Age is to be taken for the exact number of years and completed months. Values for fractional ages are obtained           
by simple interpolation. Consideration for ages or combination of lives not shown will be furnished by Symetra           
upon request.

*  The consideration shown refers to the net value of the Portfolios used to purchase a variable annuity after           
   premium taxes or other applicable charges are deducted. For example, if the Annuitant is a 65-year old male,          
   a Life Annuity initially equivalent to a monthly income of $1,000 will cost $177,060. However, because this is        
   a variable annuity, the dollar amount of this monthly income is not guaranteed and may increase or decrease.          

** Annuitant and joint Annuitant are assumed to be the same age. The rate table for the Joint & Survivor is              
   calculated based on 100% of annuity payments to the surviving Annuitant.

MORTALITY TABLE USED: The rates in the Fixed Annuity Purchase Rate Table are based upon the Annuity                      
2000 Mortality Table projected using a generational approach with an initial projection of 20 years. The effective       
interest rate assumed in the table is 2.00%.                                                                             

Age is to be taken for the exact number of years and completed months. Values for fractional ages are obtained           
by simple interpolation. Consideration for ages or combination of lives not shown will be furnished by First             
Symetra upon request.

*  The consideration shown refers to the net value used to purchase a fixed annuity after premium taxes or               
   other applicable charges are deducted. For example, if the Annuitant is a 65-year old male, a Life Annuity            
   which provides a guaranteed monthly income of $1,000 will cost $222,440.                                              
** Annuitant and joint Annuitant are assumed to be the same age. The rate table for the Joint & Survivor is              
    calculated based on 100% of annuity payments to the surviving Annuitant.

Symetra is a United States-based family of companies providing retirement plans, employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through independent distributors nationwide. The main headquarters of the company is located in Bellevue, Washington. Started in 1957, Symetra Financial began as a subsidiary of Safeco. In 1967, the total amount of insurance in force for Symetra surpassed the $1 billion mark. By 1995, the total assets had grown to $10 billion. In 2004, Safeco sold its life insurance business to an investor group led by White Mountains Insurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway.[1]
Symetra Financial was eventually acquired by Japanese insurer Sumitomo Life for $3.8billion. The Japanese insurer was looking to expand its foothold on insurance especially with an aging Japanese market.[2]

Symetra is a United States-based family of companies providing retirement plans, employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through independent distributors nationwide. The main headquarters of the company is located in Bellevue, Washington. Started in 1957, Symetra Financial began as a subsidiary of Safeco. In 1967, the total amount of insurance in force for Symetra surpassed the $1 billion mark. By 1995, the total assets had grown to $10 billion. In 2004, Safeco sold its life insurance business to an investor group led by White Mountains Insurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway.[1]
Symetra Financial was eventually acquired by Japanese insurer Sumitomo Life for $3.8billion. The Japanese insurer was looking to expand its foothold on insurance especially with an aging Japanese market.[2]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
