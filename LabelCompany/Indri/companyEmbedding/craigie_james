Petition ClosedPetitioning CEO of Church and Dwight James CraigieDecision makersJames CraigieCEO of Church and DwightStop testing your products on animals!Adira Stratton New York, NYAdira StrattonNew York, NY602SupportersEvery year, over 100 million animals are killed due to animal testing in the US. Church and Dwight is one company that treats on animals. Its many popular products include Arm & Hammer, Aim, OxiClean, and Orajel. In order for these products to be deemed safe for human use, they are first tested on animals. Many of them lose their lives, or are injured due to these tests. Animal testing wastes $16 billion a year that is taken from the taxes of Americans. If Church and Dwight stops animal testing, other companies will follow suit, and the USA will be a better place for animals, and we will save money. There are alternate ways of making sure products are safe, and these methods are surely better than killing animals.

Because early involvement by plastic surgeons and other physicians can allow development of an optimum treatment plan for each individual patient, collaboration amongst specialties is essential. As such, ASPS suggests that primary care, general surgery, radiology, pathology, oncology, gynecology, and plastic surgery be available from the onset of treatment to ensure the greatest possible outcome for the patient.RadiologistMammographyPositron Emission Tomography (PET) scans can detect cancers in women who do not have success with mammograms. Often this is a go-to diagnostic for women with breast implants, very dense tissue or lumps that can be felt but not seen in mammography. (Breast Reconstruction Guide Book - Steligo)ChemotherapyAdvances in mastectomy save normal body tissue, like the breast skin and areola, that doesn't necessarily need to be removed in every patient. Every patient is different and so are mastectomies, preventive mastectomies are different than mastectomies for cancer or when lumpectomies don't work. It is possible under the right circumstances to have a mastectomy and save the nipple. There are also situations when a mastectomy is done with a "hidden" or "scarless" approach. Ask if your plastic surgeon works with a breast surgeon who considers these options when planning your mastectomy. Also if a reconstruction is scheduled immediately following mastectomy and you have completed chemotherapy and/or radiation, the mastectomy may be done in a way to make the overall result of your reconstruction better.Radiation TherapyMRIWomen at high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should get an MRI and a mammogram every year. Women at moderately increased risk (15% to 20% lifetime risk) should talk with their doctors about the benefits and limitations of adding MRI screening to their yearly mammogram.RadiologyInternistsOvarian CancerThis national, non-profit organization offers terrific resources to individuals and families affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.Â ÂCancer CareI am so thankful and happy with my surgery and care.  I arrived in your office unhappy and unsure of what to do. I had a great cancer care experience until the mastectomy and the complications. I felt it was best to come clean with my feelings and you have been caring, respectful, and very sensitive to them.  I was bitter, which placed you behind the eight ball.  You were great with me.  My family is impressed and pleased. I love the fact that you don’t have an ego.  Life is precious. I cry as I write this note, because cancer has been a “death sentence” for young women in my father’s family.  My aunt completed breast cancer treatment 32 years ago and she is very unhappy with her reconstruction.  She plans to come from Ocean Isle Beach, NC to see you soon.  Thank you so much!SurgeonsGeneral SurgeryEast Cooper Plastic Surgery is a top-notch medical team providing a wide scope of cosmetic and reconstructive surgical services performed by Dr. Richard Kline, Dr. James Craigie and staff.NeurosurgeryIts dedicated physicians and caregivers help make this hospital the premiere health care facility in the community. Specialties include reconstructive breast surgery, women's care, spine surgery, general surgery, and neurosurgery.ÂHysterectomy"I was hesitant about the DIEP procedure because it seemed like so much surgery to have at once. Compared to the 2 C-sections and hysterectomy that I have had, the "tummy tuck" part of the procedure was a breeze. Other than a little itching at the suture sites and a tight abdomen, I barely knew that I had had surgery on my stomach."Reconstructive SurgeryI had my stage I DIEP in Charleston with Drs. Kline and Craigie this last May 25th.  On a scale of 1-10, I would rate my experience a 12!  Before I go into more detail about my Charleston experience though, let me go back in time a little bit. I had my first unilateral mastectomy in 1998 (right side) with a reduction on the left side and immediate expanders. A while later, I had the exchange for the permanent implants.  This was all done in Atlanta, Georgia.  The process was painful and inconvenient, took over a year, and was a complete flop.  My right breast was half the size of the left, terribly scarred and deformed. The left breast was oddly shaped and had a very bad, fat scar underneath and was hard.  The consequences of my low self-esteem led to intimacy problems with my husband which resulted in divorce.  Several attempts by different plastic surgeons only made the appearance of my breasts worse.  The emotional consequences became compounded.  In short, I felt like a freak.  Dating was a concept I couldn't even fathom, I was so self conscious about my looks.  One day, 13 years after my first botched surgery, I saw a program on T.V. that discussed new procedures for reconstruction surgery after mastectomy.  I immediately went on line to research the DIEP procedure and decided to look into the facilities in Charleston.  I was certain that Charleston was the right fit for me.  Drs. Kline and Craigie are artists, and their highly trained staff made each and every step of the procedure flawless.  Their attention to detail made me feel secure before, during, and after.  I'm about four months out from Stage I now.  In those short months, my life has been transformed.  I haven't had my stage II yet, that comes next month, but already I'm walking around with my head up, and my shoulders back! My breasts look great, are soft and warm,  and it's great to have those implants out.  I would also like to add, if you are a single woman contemplating a location for reconstructive surgery, I highly recommend Charleston.  The entire staff has a special sensitivity for those of us flying solo now.GynecologistsGynecologyPlastic SurgeonsBreast LiftAdvances in microsurgery and breast surgery allow us to perform mastectomy with hidden scars as in a breast lift or augmentation, without leaving scars on the breast skin. Patients who are candidates for this surgery preserve their breast skin - including the nipple and areola.Breast ReconstructionWe realize that you may still have many questions. To learn more about The Center for Natural Breast Reconstruction, or to schedule an appointment, feel free to contact us either by phone at 1.866.374.2627 or email below. During our first conversation, our staff will guide you through a pre-screening document that helps determine how well natural breast reconstruction might fit your particular needs.Plastic SurgeryDr. Kline trained in microsurgery with Dr. Robert Allen, who was pioneering the DIEP, SIEA, and GAP flaps at LSU while Dr. Kline was a plastic surgery resident. "We knew that he (Dr. Allen) was on to something very exciting," remembers Dr. Kline, "but I doubt anyone back then foresaw just how sought-after those procedures would become."Thigh LiftThe microsurgery techniques used by CNBR surgeons spare the gluteal muscle, and forms the tissue into a new breast mound. The added benefit: patients also receive a buttocks/thigh lift!Breast SurgeryMonths or years have passed since your mastectomy or breast surgery. And when the swelling and bruising finally faded, you were left with something that just "didn't work." It happens. Sometimes mastectomies, reconstructive surgeries and implant based reconstruction simply don't work as well as you hoped, nor as well as they should. Our surgeons are experts at repair work. Using the various flap techniques, they can create full, natural looking breasts with tissue from your own body. Your own tissue can be used to give you a more natural and permanent result. Approximately 1/3 of our patients have experienced failed implant reconstruction and we "start over" without sacrificing any of your important muscles. Bonus: Your buttocks or tummy may look more aesthetically pleasing than you ever expected!Body ContouringSome of Dr. James Craigie's earliest memories are of afternoons spent at hospitals with his father, a general surgeon. "I liked to go with him on call and see the things that he did," Dr. Craigie says. Today, Dr. Craigie is an accomplished surgeon himself, conducting 70-100 breast reconstruction surgeries each year, along with all types of body contouring and cosmetic breast surgery that is part of the process of breast reconstruction. "As plastic surgeon's we use techniques that are often cosmetic in nature but included as part of the reconstructive process. My main goal is to help people," he says.PsychiatristsMental HealthThis Notice of Privacy Practices describes how we may use and disclose your protected health information (PHI) to carry out treatment, payment or health care operations (TPO) and for other purposes that are permitted or required by law.

Criagie is a village, in the parish of Dalmeny, county of Linlithgow. "It is in the eastern part of the parish, and in its vicinity is Craigie Hall, formerly the residence and estate of the Craigies, an ancient and considerable family. One of them was a witness to the original charter granted to the first laird of Dundas in the year 1120." [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland. Institute of Historical Research, 1848, Print. The Barony of Craigie is a Scottish  feudal Crown barony near Dundee and there are two other locals named Craigie: a hamlet  in the parish of Caputh; and a village, in the East parish of the city and county of Perth. The latter is home "of the old castle of Craigie" [1]CITATION[CLOSE]Lewis, Samuel, A Topographical Dictionary of Scotland.

In the colonies, they could find not only freedom from the iron hand of the English government, but land to settle on. The American  War of Independence allowed many of these settlers to prove their independence, while some chose to go to Canada as United Empire Loyalists.

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
