About Aim Exploration

Aim Exploration Inc. (AEXE) is a Henderson, Nevada headquartered company. Aim operates as a mining company focusing towards Anthracite production in Peru and worldwide marketing through a joint venture corporation with Prina Energy of India. The joint venture marketing arm is currently in the process of being formed and is intended to have the head office in Dubai, UEA.
The Anthracite Coal concessions are owned and/or controlled through their wholly owned subsidiary Aim Exploration SA. in Peru. AIM considers the mining concessions in Peru to be a high grade Anthracite Coal property in the Alto Chicama basin, in the province of Otuzco in Peru. Aim SA acquired these rights by purchasing these assets from Percana Mining Corp (Percana SA), a Peruvian corporation.
 
Present Activities
 The assets encompass 1,000 hectares of mining concession property consisting of three sites of 600, 200 and 200 hectares respectively. Percana SA initially acquired these properties based on indications of the presence of high grade anthracite coal. Illegal artisan miners are currently operating multiple one-entry mines on the property, which further indicates the presence and mine-ability of these deposits. To verify the geology and quality of the coal, Percana SA commissioned local geologists to compile a technical report on the 1,000 hectares. Although the report yielded optimistic estimates of resources, reserves and economics, it does not meet public reporting standards.
Consequently, Aim commissioned Gustavson Associates (of Colorado, USA) to visit the site, and to recommend plans for commencing mining projects on the property. The visit occurred at the end of 2013, and the report thereof outlined a four-phased approach for obtaining an “Indicated & Measured” classification for the deposits, and for compiling a Preliminary Economic Assessment. Aim now has a 36-month operations plan that accounts for the steps recommended by Gustavson, while enabling the company to immediately commence the business of selling coal sourced from artisan miners on and around its property.

Over the span of seven years, Percana SA acquired 3 mining concession properties in the Lajon area of the Huaranchal District, in the province of Otuzco. Totaling 1000 hectares, the individual properties are 600, 200 and 200 hectares respectively. The following table outlines the details of these properties:

600 hectares


Resolution No. 493-2001-RPM (March 16, 2001)




 
PREVIOUS ACTIVITIES
Percana SA purchased the concession properties based on indications of high-grade anthracite coal deposits. ( illegal artisan miners have been extracting anthracite coal from approx. 20 tunnel mines on one section of the properties.) To verify the geology and quality of these deposits, the company commissioned local Peruvian engineers and geologists to complete a Technical Report. While this report was very strong, the estimates of resources, reserves and economics did not meet public reporting standards. 
Anthracite coal samples from the tunnels have been tested by the SGS labs and the results have been excellent, these results can be obtained by contacting the company. 
Aim SA engaged Gustavson Associates to visit the site in order to provide preliminary assessments and recommendations for advancing projects on the property.

About Aim Exploration

Aim Exploration Inc. (AEXE) is a Henderson, Nevada headquartered company. Aim operates as a mining company focusing towards Anthracite production in Peru and worldwide marketing through a joint venture corporation with Prina Energy of India. The joint venture marketing arm is currently in the process of being formed and is intended to have the head office in Dubai, UEA.
The Anthracite Coal concessions are owned and/or controlled through their wholly owned subsidiary Aim Exploration SA. in Peru. AIM considers the mining concessions in Peru to be a high grade Anthracite Coal property in the Alto Chicama basin, in the province of Otuzco in Peru. Aim SA acquired these rights by purchasing these assets from Percana Mining Corp (Percana SA), a Peruvian corporation.
 
Present Activities
 The assets encompass 1,000 hectares of mining concession property consisting of three sites of 600, 200 and 200 hectares respectively. Percana SA initially acquired these properties based on indications of the presence of high grade anthracite coal. Illegal artisan miners are currently operating multiple one-entry mines on the property, which further indicates the presence and mine-ability of these deposits. To verify the geology and quality of the coal, Percana SA commissioned local geologists to compile a technical report on the 1,000 hectares. Although the report yielded optimistic estimates of resources, reserves and economics, it does not meet public reporting standards.
Consequently, Aim commissioned Gustavson Associates (of Colorado, USA) to visit the site, and to recommend plans for commencing mining projects on the property. The visit occurred at the end of 2013, and the report thereof outlined a four-phased approach for obtaining an “Indicated & Measured” classification for the deposits, and for compiling a Preliminary Economic Assessment. Aim now has a 36-month operations plan that accounts for the steps recommended by Gustavson, while enabling the company to immediately commence the business of selling coal sourced from artisan miners on and around its property.

AIM Exploration Inc. Shares the Latest Anthracite Analysis - Strong Positive Results

							Positive Lab results on Anthracite.						


Press Release
-

												Oct 5, 2016						
 





			Henderson, NV, 
			October 5, 2016			(Newswire.com) -
	AIM Exploration Inc. (OTCBB: AEXE) (OTC: AEXE)
AIM EXPLORATION RECEIVES LATEST ANTHRACITE ANALYSIS -- STRONG POSITIVE RESULTS PROVING HIGH GRADE anthracite extracted from the existing tunnels within the 1000 hectare Peru mining concessions.
AIM Exploration had samples of coal extracted from their mining concessions delivered to the world renowned SGS labs mineral services for evaluation and confirmation of the quality of the coal. The analysis consists of a fully comprehensive report where the technicians test the coal finding the chemical composition to a 0.001% degree of accuracy.
For more information on SGS labs see: http://www.sgs.ca/en/Energy.aspx
The findings were broken down into a rigorous series of tests specifically for coal: 10 tests for percentage elemental composition and 13 major classification coverage tests. The results prove that the coal is high grade anthracite with energy output of 7235 KiloCals per kilogram which is in the range for high heat burning anthracite.
The detailed results are attached to this press release and shared as either image format or PDF format so that all of our audience can easily review it. Please look at the supplemental images below for links to the jpg of PDFs of the granular SGS lab results.
For our audience, "ASTM International is an international standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical standards for a wide range of materials, products, systems, and services. Some 12,575 ASTM voluntary consensus standards operate globally." Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTM_International
In the tables (attached as images), "ND" denotes "Not detected".
Highlights from the extensive lab survey are as follows:
All of the tests performed have results that are indicative of high-grade anthracite.
The summary of the 3 page scientific report:

Little moisture of 1.87%
Ash is 3.55% denoting clean wastage.
And most importantly is the energy output of 7235 KiloCals per kilogram which is in the range for high heat burning anthracite.
The HGI is 35, which is an index of hardness where 30 is hard and 100 is the softest http://www.sgs.ca/en/Energy/Energy-Sources/Coal/Coal-Analysis/Hardgrove-Grindability-Index-HGI.aspx


Anthracite is also called "hard coal" although its composition is mostly dense carbon of 87% or higher. Being that it is not used for thermal coal. The density of carbon and low ash and low moisture amounts are good for industrial usage to produce high grade steel and water purification with the least amount of output impurities, contrasting to the lower grade coals lignite and bituminous and coking coal.

Anthracite as specified in the external source: http://www.chemicalland21.com/petrochemical/ANTHRACITE.htm where it states that, "It is nearly pure carbon, is very hard, black, and lustrous and burns with a clean flame and little smoke or odor. The moisture content is not more than 15 percent and the heat value ranges is from 22 to 28 million Btu per ton on a dry basis."
"The significance of the lab results shows that the mine property in Peru contains high value anthracite coal (92.29% carbon density). We are very excited about these findings because the demand for anthracite coal is growing and AIM Exploration is fully invested to provide anthracite coal to the world," says J.R. Todhunter, President and CEO of Aim Exploration.
Todhunter further went on to say that our highly positive lab test results makes us proud to have an ecologically responsible mineral with a high carbon content (92.29%) that can be applied to industrial uses worldwide.
The anthracite studies of import/export show that North America, Asia (india and china), and the Middle East have positive demand for anthracite coal, and are linearly proportional to their output for high grade quality steels and high precision steel products. External 2014 reports show that we are net 5.4% growth in anthracite usage worldwide. This is cited in the Anthacite Market Survey online at http://www.resource-net.com/rsn_uploads/files/Sample_2014.pdf on page 12 illustrated in the table below (as an image link).
"The sulphur content in our report is low where SGS labs show ND ( not detected ) which is an indication of clean product output when burning the coal (see column F). At 92.29% carbon we feel that our product is highly desirable in all markets in the world see column C). Anthracite has a composition between 87 to 97% so we are well within the range of high quality anthracite," says the Company (http://en.openei.org/wiki/Definition:Anthracite_coal )
In general with our highly positive lab results we are well positioned to work with other vendors to created Electrically Calcined Anthracite (ECA) (citation: http://wucarbon.com/zhsh.asp?id=178641) which can be used in the Aluminum industry and blended coal, which is a generic term. Blended coal is a mixture of lower grade coals with anthracite to create high BTU output. Anthracite is the key component for the BTU output to be consistent and high heat and for steady thermal distribution when in a kiln or am industrial oven," Abstracts and studies of Combustion characteristics of anthracite and bleanded coal with composite catalysts can be found online at: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743967114000312
Much of the world news of anthracite has been disseminated through our twitter page at www.twitter.com/aexeqb . The purpose of propagating the news about anthracite is not intended to be self serving -- rather it is to show that we are in an energy hungry era and we need to look for ecologically low impacting energy resources.
Aim Exploration has this formal report and is proceeding with marketing the Company. It is currently in talks with Prina Energy to start a joint venture with them. ( see www.prinaenergy.com)
We welcome our audience to view our web site http://aimexploration.com
We further welcome people to follow our twitter feed at www.twitter.com/aexeqb which has 2200 followers and growing. "This gives us indication that clean energy is a global concern and enforces our belief that is why we need to carry out our objective of mining clean high BTU anthracite coal." Says J.R. (Bob) Todhunter.
About Aim Exploration: The Company is a Anthracite coal mining and exploration company and plans to mine 1,000 hectares of land. We have expertise in business, mining, and legal with our distinguished board of directors. We have amicable relationships with all parties involved in mining in Peru.

The Selling Stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered in the 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the resale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to 
the registration of the shares for the Selling Stockholders.


We are a junior mineral resource exploration company.  We compete with other
mineral resource exploration companies for financing and for the acquisition of
new mineral properties.  Many of the mineral resource exploration companies with
whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than those
available to us.  Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater
amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their
mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties.  In addition,
they may be able to afford more geological expertise in the targeting and
exploration of mineral properties.  This competition could result in competitors
having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective
investors who may finance additional exploration and development.  This
competition could adversely impact on our ability to achieve the financing
necessary for us to conduct further exploration of our mineral properties.

We will also compete with other junior mineral exploration companies for
financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make
investments in junior mineral exploration companies.  The presence of competing
junior mineral exploration companies may impact on our ability to raise
additional capital in order to fund our exploration programs if investors are of
the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on the merit
of the mineral properties under investigation and the price of the investment
offered to investors.

We will also compete with other junior and senior mineral companies for
available resources, including, but not limited to, professional geologists,
camp staff, helicopter or float planes, mineral exploration supplies and drill
rigs.


Company Description
We are an exploration stage mining company and we plan to engage in the 
acquisition and exploration of mineral properties and to date we have received 
no revenues from our operations. We have not yet commenced operations and we 
have primarily undertaken only organizational activities. Our


 independent 
auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a 
going concern without significant additional financing. We will not generate 
revenues even if our initial exploration program indicates that feldspar or 
other mineral material may exist on the property that is the subject of our 
Raval Claim. Accordingly, for the foreseeable future, we will continue to be 
dependent on additional financing in order to maintain our operations and 
continue with our exploration activities. 

We are not sure yet if the property covered by the Raval contains any 
substantial mineral deposits or reserves of minerals. Additional exploration of
the property is required before making any determination as to whether any 
commercially viable mineral deposit may exist. We will require significant 
financing to undertake this additional exploration, and currently, we do not 
have plans for obtaining this financing.   

We were incorporated under the laws of Nevada effective February 18, 2010. Our 
principal offices are located at Suite 514 VGP Center 6772 Ayala Ave. Makati 
City, Manila, Philippines. Our telephone number is (632) 754-9929.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
