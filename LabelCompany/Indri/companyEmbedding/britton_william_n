Mr. Britton is a former member of the Northeast Advisory Council of Opera Solutions, a private firm engaged in consulting. Mr. Britton is a former Vice President-Finance for the Boy Scouts of America (Manhattan Council) and is on the board of the Rutgers Business School. We believe that Mr. Britton's finance and business consultation and executive-level management experience, as well as his service on the Board of the Company since 2006, give him the qualifications and skills to serve as one of our directors.

In that time, Bill and I developed an incredibly successful and thriving work partnership. On a daily basis, in conjunction with our boss Barb, we were in charge of managing every aspect of The CN8 Network's 24/7/365 Master Control department. 
 
From the coordination of numerous external broadcast sources A-Z to the intricate process of handling all the internal routing needs pertaining to the network's constant influx of feeds and guests for live air.
 
From directly partnering with outside media agencies/clients/sources in order to guarantee that all the necessary information related to any given scheduled broadcast was distributed properly and known by all to personally supervising every major high-profile live event, which always included being fully prepared to trouble-shoot any potential issue in a matter of seconds.
 
From training, interviewing and hiring to the conscription and continuous upkeep of the network's emergency procedures manual.  
 
From the various week-to-week staff and scheduling issues concerning our "always live" broadcast operations facility to dealing with every other department within the network on a routine basis.
 
From constant spot inventory checks to ensuring the complete accuracy of each day's Master Control broadcast logs.
 
From being the first persons responsible to learn all new equipment and procedures in an expedient and flawless fashion to running staff meetings and serving as a direct consultant/adviser for upper management as required.
 
Bill effectively worked with us to manage all of the above and deliver nothing less than the highest level quality and success day-in and day-out for many years. And Bill continues to do so today in his new role as a broadcast master control manager for The Comcast Network.
 
Bill is a seasoned veteran and true broadcast professional. He is reliable, intelligent, dedicated and skilled. His personal work ethic is tremendous. He is capable of taking the lead and being tough when he needs to be, but in doing so he never falters when it comes to his commitment to fairness and his ability to "roll up his sleeves and jump in" and truly earn the genuine respect of his fellow co-workers. Bill is also a really personable and friendly guy; he can get along with anyone. And on a final note, Bill is probably the most punctual person I have ever encountered at any point in my entire 20+ years professional career.    
 
Recommending Bill as someone who can handle anything in any situation is an easy statement to make for me, because I have seen his daily work performance first-hand for almost 10 years now. And I can assure anyone that when it comes to work and professionalism, Bill is as good as they come. You couldn't ask to find a better employee and/or person.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended William NGroupsTV & FILM JOB LOOPFinal Cut Pro Video EditingFilm and Television ProfessionalsView William N’S full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact William N directlyView William N’S Full ProfileView this profile in another languageEnglishGermanPeople Also ViewedJoshua ElmoreCharles NorthcuttMaster Control Manager at Spectrum ReachJason MonsonMaster Control Manager at ABC/FOX MontanaMariana ZamoraProgramming CoordinatorTyler HaleVice President, Studio Production at CBS SportsChris DodsonMaster Control Operations Manager at WVUA 23Israel AlejandroMaster Control ManagerLee SchaefferMaster Control Manager at Cornerstone Television NetworkBrian FergusonManager - On Air Operations at CBS Sports NetworkPublic profile badgeInclude this LinkedIn profile on other websitesView profile badgesSearch by nameOver 500 million professionals are already on LinkedIn.
