History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989.

CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

Las Vegas Sands Corp.
About











LAS VEGAS SANDS CORP.
About Us In the 1990s, Las Vegas Sands™ (NYSE: LVS) created and introduced to the world an entirely new kind of travel destination: the Integrated Resort.  As one of the leading global developers of destination properties, unlike the other hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, we offer an array of high-end amenities and integrated them under one roof to provide the ultimate guest experience.  From sumptuous suites to plush meeting rooms, celebrity status night clubs, intimate lounges, headliner and resident shows, upscale gaming, ultra-relaxing spa services, a wide range of retail shops and award-winning cuisine, we created a self-sustained world of entertainment at each of our exquisite properties in Las Vegas, Bethlehem (Pennsylvania), Singapore and Macau (China).
Our integrated resorts have become premier destinations for travel enthusiasts around the world.  We have raised the bar of excellence in the hospitality industry, providing unparalleled guest service, a luxurious atmosphere and a dynamic resort experience with each and every visit.
The guiding business philosophy of Las Vegas Sands is to see things from our guests' point of view.  All aspects of our resorts have one and only one goal: to make each guest’s time with us as unforgettably enjoyable as possible.  If you stay at any of our resorts, you will soon see how we continually strive to make the experience all about you.
The Venetian and The Palazzo Among our properties in the United States are two luxury resorts on the Las Vegas Strip - The Venetian® and The Palazzo® - where every room key unlocks a suite.  
The Venetian's standard suite is nearly double the size of the average Las Vegas hotel room, prompting it to be featured in the Guinness Book of World Records as the “largest standard hotel room in the world.”  If Guinness still included this category, The Palazzo (which opened in 2007) would surely be included as well, as it is the world’s largest all-suite resort hotel.
In 2014, TripAdvisor named The Venetian the world's most extraordinarily designed hotel.  When combined with Sands® Expo Convention Center, The Venetian and The Palazzo make up the largest LEED certified building on the planet, a testament to our commitment to sustainability.  
The Venetian and The Palazzo offer a variety of cuisines from a collection of award-winning chefs such as Buddy V’s by “The Cake Boss” Buddy Valastro,  Carnevino by Mario Batali, CUT by Wolfgang Puck, Bouchon by Thomas Keller, and Table 10 by Emeril Lagasse.
The expansive Venetian and Palazzo Congress Center features convention and meeting rooms that span 340 distinct venues and more than 2.25 million square feet of flexible space, including the 85,000-square-foot Venetian Ballroom and the newly remodeled Sands Expo. 
Grand Canal Shoppes® at The Venetian and The Palazzo features  more than 160 luxury boutiques, specialty brands and world-class restaurants nestled around a charming and faithful reproduction of Venice’s Grand Canal, complete with cobbled walkways, street side cafes and live entertainment. Signature brands include Nevada’s only Barneys New York, Jimmy Choo, Diane von Furstenberg, Christian Louboutin, Kenneth Cole, Dooney & Bourke, Hervé Léger and Swarovski.
Located in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, The Venetian features an indoor streetscape complete with gondolas and singing gondoliers, world-class gaming, exquisite restaurants, a wide variety of entertainment such as “John Fogerty – Fortunate Son in Concert,” showroom headlinersHuman Nature, and the female stand-up comedy series LIPSHTICK – The Perfect Shade of Stand Up.
Other unique offerings include the chic dining and nightlife hotspots, TAO and LAVO; the world’s largest Canyon Ranch SpaClub®; and Lagasse’s Stadium, the ultimate sports bar, sports book and restaurant on the Strip.
The Palazzo and The Venetian Las Vegas are the first ever Alliance Resorts in the InterContinental Hotel Group global portfolio.
Our Other Resorts Also in the United States is Sands® Casino Resort Bethlehem, situated on a historic steel mill in beautifully verdant Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
In Asia, we created and own the iconic Marina Bay Sands® in Singapore.  We also developed - through our majority-owned subsidiary Sands China Ltd. - a collection of leading properties in Macau, including The Venetian® Macao Resort Hotel, Sands® Macao, Four Seasons Hotel Macao, The Plaza Macao, as well as our most recent addition: Sands Cotai Central®, which boasts the world's largest Conrad, Sheraton and Holiday Inn hotels.
In addition to our commitment to tourism, we are involved in numerous philanthropic activities through Sands Cares®, our charitable nonprofit organization. We're also committed to global sustainability through Sands Eco 360°, our company-wide initiative to make our resorts the most eco-friendly in our industry.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

History[edit]
Entrepreneur Sheldon Adelson and his partners Dick Katzeff, Irwin Chafetz, Ted Cutler, and Jordan Shapiro bought the famous Sands Hotel in 1989. They opened the Sands Expo and Convention Center across from the hotel in 1990. The 1.2-million-square-foot center is currently the largest privately owned convention facility in the world.
The Sands Hotel was having trouble competing with the newer resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, Adelson imploded it to make room for The Venetian. Construction of the Venetian began in 1997, when themed hotels were the fashion. Modeled on Venice, Italy, it joined Excalibur, New York-New York, Paris Las Vegas and other themed hotels on the Las Vegas Strip.
When the trend in Las Vegas then shifted to more understated and "elegant" hotels, construction on The Palazzo began in 2005. Together, the Palazzo, Venetian and Sands Expo make up the world’s largest integrated resort, with 7,100 all-suite rooms, 2.3 million square feet of convention and exhibition space, and an array of shopping, dining and entertainment options.
Adelson got his start through the trade show business. As early as the 1970s, he saw the potential in personal computers. He and his partners founded the computer trade show COMDEX in 1979. They then sold it in 1995 for more than $800 million. In 2004, Adelson took the Venetian's parent company public:[4] Las Vegas Sands Inc. became Las Vegas Sands Corp.
Perhaps because of his start in the trade show business, Adelson focused his hotel efforts on courting the convention and trade show industry. At the time, when other hotels were focusing on gambling, his approach was considered unorthodox: the traditional strategy was to keep hotel rooms minimal, so as to encourage guests to spend as much time as possible in the casino. Adelson, however, had all his hotel rooms made into luxury suites; he put in mini-bars and big screen televisions; and he created comfortable work spaces in every room. By doing all this, he counted on business from the Sands Expo and Convention Center to keep mid-week occupancy strong. This proved correct; the company now makes more money in Las Vegas from conventions than gambling.[5] And Adelson's convention-centered approach is no longer considered unorthodox, but rather the paradigm in the hospitality industry in Las Vegas.
Adelson was also among the first to foresee the financial potential of Asia. Before his American competitors, he made the move to locate his company nearer to the Asian market. Macau, the former Portuguese colony turned over to China in late 1999, is the only place on mainland China where casino gambling is legal. Las Vegas Sands opened the Sands Macao in 2004.
Adelson next saw that 1 billion people are within a three-hour flight of Macau, and around 3 billion people are estimated to live within a five-hour flight. He realized that his company's future was in creating not one hotel, but establishing an entire strip---a Las Vegas-like Boulevard in Macau featuring many hotels of various styles and price ranges. But there were physical challenges to his idea: the total area of the small peninsula and two islands that make up Macao is less than 12 square miles; this area is densely populated; and, at the time, there was no land for such a large strip.
So Adelson created the land: he had his company fill the bay between the Coloane and Taipa islands. He called the area the Cotai Strip.
He then began construction of the largest inhabited building in the world---the Venetian Macao. To ensure the structure was stable, 13,500 steel piles were driven into the bedrock below. At peak times, 15,000 people were working on the construction site. Adelson set a three-year time limit for construction. This meant building needed to take place at a rapid pace, but the building was finished on time. The hotel officially opened at 7:18 p.m. on August 28, 2007---a time that was believed to have good feng shui.
The resort is twice the size of its Las Vegas counterpart, with an arena that will seat 15,000 people and one of the largest exhibition centers in Asia. The resort receives between 70,000 and 100,000 visitors each day and has a staff of approximately 12,000 on site. The 550,000-square-foot casino is also the largest in the world.
In 2008, Las Vegas Sands opened a Four Seasons hotel next to the Venetian Macao, as well as Paiza Mansions, which are "for invited guests only." The company is also building resorts in Macau for a number of brands---The Holiday Inn, Intercontinental, and Sheraton Hotels---when they open on the Sands Cotai Central in the first quarter of 2012.
Despite its successes, Las Vegas Sands hit hard times in 2008 during the financial crises. At one a point the company was losing $1,000 per second. The stock price fell 97 percent within a 52-week period. To stop the bleeding, Adelson loaned the company $1billion of his own money.
He also continued with plans to build a $5.6 billion resort---Marina Bay Sands---in Singapore. Given the financial difficulties the company was facing, there was skepticism about the decision to build the Marina Bay Sands. However, Adelson argued that, with only one other competitor in Singapore, opening the resort would prove profitable. After it opened at the end of April, 2010, it posted a $600 million operating profit in the first eight months of business, a record in the industry.
The Marina Bay Sands has three 55-story towers with approximately 2,600 rooms and suites. Atop the hotel is the Sands SkyPark, a park that is set on top of the three towers. The park has vegetation, an observation deck, several restaurants, and a swimming pool that seems to flow over the building. The resort's location right next to the city center allows it to serve as an entertainment site for the local population and also a destination for business travelers and MICE (Meetings, Incentive, Convention, Exhibition) events. A year after Marina Bay Sands opened, tourism to Singapore shot up 20% and the economy expanded by 15%.
Las Vegas Sands continues to look for new expansion opportunities. It is keeping an eye on countries such as Japan, Korea,[6] Vietnam, Taiwan and Thailand. In the US, the company continues to expand its 2009 resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which opened in 2009 to compete with Atlantic City for some of the New York-area market. Las Vegas Sands has also talked about the possibility of a Florida resort.
In Europe, Adelson and his management team were in discussions with governments in Madrid and Barcelona. In September 2012, Las Vegas Sands Corp. announced Madrid had been chosen as the destination for the gambling resort project dubbed Eurovegas.[7] More precisely, in February 2013 it was reported the town of Alcorcón, in the outskirts of the Spanish capital had been chosen as the site for the "EuroVegas" project.[8] It was expected to take about ten years to build six casinos, twelve hotels, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants.[9] However, in December 2013 the Eurovegas project was officially canceled and it will not be established anywhere in Europe.[10]
In Q1 2015, the company proposed a 65,000-seat facility for the Oakland Raiders football team. The total cost would be an estimated $1.2 billion, and the stadium would be located near the Las Vegas Strip and UNLV. It would be co-developed with City of Industry, California-based Majestic Realty Co.[11] By estimation, the stadium could be ready for NFL games by 2020. The proposal would require $420 million from private investors and $780 million in public funding. The main benefit from a stadium near the Strip is the benefit to tourism in Las Vegas.[11]
Political contributions[edit]
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Las Vegas Sands was the #1 contributor to federal campaigns during the 2012 election cycle, donating $52.9 million, 100% to Republicans.[12] By comparison, during that same period #2 Adelson Drug Clinic contributed $42.1 million, 100% to Republicans, and #21 Goldman Sachs donated $8.9 million, 77% to Republicans.[12] Since 1992, Las Vegas Sands has contributed $70.5 million to federal campaigns, and since 1999 has spent $5.4 million on lobbying.[13]

Ownership and stock[edit]
CEO Sheldon Adelson and his family currently[when?] own approximately 52% of the company.[citation needed] In December 2004, the company completed its initial public offering with the ticker LVS on the New York Stock Exchange at a price of $29 per share.[4] Only 6.8 percent of Las Vegas Sands was put on the market.[4] Adelson maintained 87.9 percent ownership of the company, while its management and directors owned the remaining 5.3 percent.[4] In October 2007, the company's market capitalization peaked at $52 billion at $144.56 a share. However, because of general market declines and overall concern of the short-term financial health of the gambling industry, the market capitalization sank to approximately $1 billion at less than $2 a share by March 2009.
On September 30, 2008, with the company stock trading at $36.11, Adelson and his wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, invested $475 million in the company through a 6.5% convertible note due in 2013. Subsequent to the $475 million investment by the Adelson family, and due to a further deterioration of the global economic environment, on November 11, 2008, the company announced that it will be receiving an additional investment of $525 million from Adelson and his family along with a raising an additional $1 billion in a secondary offering. The Adelsons agreed to buy 5.25 million shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase about 87.5 million shares of common stock at an exercise price of $6 each.
In November 2009, the company completed an initial public offering of Sands China Ltd., its subsidiary that owns and operated its Macau properties, and raised a total of $3.3 billion in equity capital by selling a 29% interest in Sands China Ltd.

Alleged antibribery violations[edit]
In March 2013, media reports claimed that Las Vegas Sands informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had likely violated federal law against bribery of foreign officials.[16] The company fired back at these reports, stating in a press release: "The company did not report any violations of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and it said news reports stating otherwise, such as the headline in today's New York Times which described the matter by saying 'Casino Says it Likely Cheated,' are both inflammatory and defamatory."[17] The company claimed that what it reported was that "in its preliminary findings the company's Audit Committee had advised that there were 'likely violations' of the books and records and internal controls provisions (i.e. 'accounting provisions') of the FCPA. A potential violation of the accounting provisions could range anywhere from a single transaction recorded incorrectly to other errors in the accounting records. The company said it will vigorously defend itself against that type of uninformed and misleading reporting."[17]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
