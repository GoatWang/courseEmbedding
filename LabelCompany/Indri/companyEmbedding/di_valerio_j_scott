Di Valerio, who also resigned from Outerwall’s board, was named CEO in April 2013. His previous experience included serving as Outerwall’s financial chief, starting in 2010. Denzel has been on Outerwall’s board for nearly two years. Her previous experience includes various management positions at Intuit Inc. from February 2008 through August 2012.

Alphabet adds Google CEO Sundar Pichai to board
              
              Alphabet Inc.  announced Monday that is has added Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai to its board. In a reorganization two years ago that created the Alphabet umbrella corporation, Google cofounder Larry Page became the CEO of Alphabet and Pichai rose to lead the most important Alphabet asset, Google. Since then, Pichai has become one of the most prominent Alphabet executives in public events and earnings calls, along with Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat, and could be the highest paid CEO in the U.S. "Sundar has been doing a great job as Google's CEO, driving strong growth, partnerships, and tremendous product innovation," Page said in Monday's announcement. "I really enjoy working with him and I'm excited that he is joining the Alphabet board." Alphabet is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings after the market closes Monday, and shares were bouncing between slight gains and losses in Monday trading.

Pandora Media shares gain more than 4% premarket after upbeat analyst note
              
              Shares of internet radio company Pandora Media Inc.  were up 4.5% in premarket trade on Monday after an upbeat analyst note. SunTrust analyst Matthew Thornton sent a note to investors on Monday following a meeting with Pandora interim Chief Executive Naveed Chopra. Thornton's key takeaways from the meeting were that the subscription model that many analysts feel Pandora was late to isn't going away, but the company plans to drop investment to maintenance levels. Pandora also plans to increase its focus on monetizing radio, while reallocating subscription investment to sales hires and ad technology. The company also wants to increase focus on cost efficiencies. Thornton said Chopra told him that Pandora's hours growth could hinge on new content and that more details will be available in the coming quarters. Thornton maintains a buy rating on Pandora and a $10.50 12-month price target, which is about 11% above current trading levels. Pandora shares have declined more than 27% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 index  is up more than 10% during the same period.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

              Recreational vehicles company Polaris Industries Inc.  recalled about 25,600 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) after reports of fuel leaks and fires.

The recall follows 30 reports of fuel leaks and four incidents involving a fire, although no injuries had been reported. "Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled ATVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair," the company said in a statement. "Polaris is contacting all known purchasers directly." The stock, which was up 1.2% in afternoon trade, has rallied 12.9% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%.

‹ Previous ArticleNext Article ›× BACK TO CFO ARTICLESJ. Scott Di Valerio, CFO for Coinstar, Inc. and Glenn Ayers, partner at Mercer, discuss how Coinstar has grown by addressing unmet customer needs and the importance of culture and nurturing an ecosystem in a company’s success.
Glenn Ayers: Can you start by giving us a bit of background on Coinstar?
Scott Di Valerio: Coinstaris a leader in the automated retail space, and we focus on going after an unmet demand by the consumer. Currently that means moving on the trends that you see in urbanization, instant access, technology and other ways where people want to be able to get the products they want, when they want them and in a way that’s simple, convenient and drives value for the overall business.
One of our two major brands is Coinstar, which is the green machine in front of the stores where you can convert your coins into cash, iTunes, Amazon.com cards or Starbucks coffee cards. The other is the Redbox kiosk that allows you to rent DVDs in a way that’s much more efficient and effective than the brick-and-mortar stores. We like to say that at Coinstar we’re reimaging retail; we’re able to bring great products to consumers in a way that they like, while also driving great value for us and our retail partners.
How did you arrive at Coinstar?
I started with PricewaterhouseCoopers, eventually becoming a partner in the San Diego office while also running the Technology Information Communication and Entertainment (TICE) practice in the Czech Republic for a bit. Later I went to the Walt Disney Company as a corporate vice president corporate controllership before moving to Microsoft as Corporate Vice President and Corporate Controller, later moving to CVP OEM Division. From Microsoft I went to a company called Lenovo – which is now the number one PC manufacturer in the world – where I helped reposition some of the things that they were doing in the Americas and launched a consumer brand for them. They had a very strong consumer business in China and Asia but nothing outside of that region, so the ability to come in and launch a consumer brand was quite a lot of fun.
When the Coinstar opportunity came up, like most people, I thought about the coin machine in the front of the store which was the initial business that started 22 years ago. But after I talked with CEO Paul Davis and did some research on the company, I found that there was also this Redbox business that was changing how people rented their DVDs, and while it was good for consumers it wasn’t necessarily helping make friends with the studios. It was a very fast-growing but also controversial business. They also had a vision to extend out the automated retail platform by bringing in concepts that would take over the growth mantel of Coinstar and Redbox over an extended period of time. So there was a nice stable business in Coinstar, a fast-growing and dynamic business in Redbox, and a new business arena in our ventures today. It was a very interesting opportunity to come on and be able to drive more on both the CFO side as well as the operations side.
Are there any experiences you’ve had at your previous companies that you’ve been able to draw on to help Coinstar grow?
I’ve had a lot of great experiences throughout my career, not necessarily all planned. My time in San Diego was helpful because I had a client base of start-ups, some of which grew into relatively large companies, and I was able to work with great entrepreneurs and see their success patterns and how they were able to evolve and drive sales with additional product lines and offerings. Meanwhile, my time at Walt Disney and Microsoft gave me experience with large brands while bringing great things to the marketplace, both from an enterprise and retail perspective.
At Lenovo I was able to use those experiences in transitioning our core business, which has helped in evolving the Coinstar business to make sure that as we look out five or ten years down the road what we’re doing is done from a strategic perspective. As a result, we make the decisions at the right time to evolve them, but we also make the hard decisions about not over-investing when businesses aren’t necessarily going to be successful. You can fall in love with those businesses, but you have to get the right return for shareholders.
There’s been a prevailing mood of caution that’s dominated the offices of CFOs since the recession, especially with the recent presidential election. Since Coinstar was recognized by Fortune as one of the world’s 100 fastest-growing companies in 2011 and 2012, what are you doing differently and why is this working for you?
We’ve been pretty successful at focusing on the consumer first and then building businesses around their needs. That goes back to when the business was started by a gentleman called Jens Molbak, who was a grad student at Stanford. One night Jens and his friends wanted to go out. Jens had a whole bunch of coins and he brought them to a bank which wouldn’t accept them unless they rolled them.  He did his grad thesis on how to better monetize these coins and get them back into circulation. When Jens graduated that thesis turned into the coin business. Coinstar started as a way to meet an unmet consumer need.
With Redbox, the objective was to move away from a very costly rental experience in the brick-and-mortar stores. Rather than have consumers search through racks and racks of DVDs, we provide a Redbox kiosk that’s in front of grocery stores or convenience stores where people can rent DVDs as often as three times a week. And at $1.20 it’s a great value. We have been able to focus on those consumer patterns and also increase the traffic flows of retail partners. Our key principals there are that we grow top line as well as bottom line revenue. It’s easy to grow top line revenue but it’s a little harder to grow both. In the last three years though we’ve grown quite substantially from the top perspective while tripling our EPS, and we’ve increased our return on investment capital from 8.3 at the end of 2009 to 15.1 at the end of 2011, all through staying focused on driving growth and making those investments where we’re going to bring it to the bottom line.
So is there anything in particular that has allowed you to continue that growth over the past few years?
We provide value, convenience and simplicity to our consumers, and in times like this people especially want that. Roughly a billion people walk past our kiosks each and every month who want to convert their coins or get a DVD or a cup of coffee, and the simplicity in doing that really resonates for them. It also resonates with our retail partners, because the small footprint of the Redbox or Coinstar machines is driving straight revenue and high profit.
With that being said there is still a lot of uncertainty around the future. How are you going about managing the financial risk with that in mind?
Our focus is on making sure that our investments in our new businesses and core businesses give the right return for our shareholders, so we take a very disciplined approach. It’s great to keep investing in these businesses, but the shareholders need to see a nice return as well as the way forward. The coin business is stable and able to grow in a way that makes sense. For example, we are partnering with PayPal so that when you put your coins in you can load a PayPal account. That opens up a whole new opportunity for our under-banked or non-banked customers to open up a PayPal account and begin transacting with our Web merchants, which is an opportunity for us as well.
With Redbox we’ve got more than 40,000 kiosks out there and a DVD business that, depending on who you talk to, is either going away tomorrow or will be around another 15 years. So we set up a team and said let’s assume that in X-number of years the DVD business will be in decline. How are we going to monetize both the Redbox brand’s convenience and simplicity, as well as leverage those kiosks that are out there for an extended period of time past when DVDs are around?  That team then researched and did a whole bunch of testing to arrive at about five different ideas that they wanted to bring to market to test. The one we put in the lead was the ticket business, which gives the ability to go and buy tickets to local events like playhouses and film festivals as well as Disney on Ice and circuses and large concerts. You buy your tickets and pay a dollar fee, compared to what the traditional fees are from a ticket place. That once again goes back to great value, simplicity and convenience.
We know that 30 percent to 40 percent of the event ticket inventory goes unsold largely because of lack of awareness about the events in town or because the costs are too high. We can utilize our kiosks to make people aware through the screens that an event is in town, as well as utilize our 40 million e-mail addresses to inform people on the Redbox site. This allows us to focus on a local perspective, as well as drive great ticket sales for our partners in way that’s very efficient. Let’s say you are going up to a kiosk to get Carrie Underwood tickets; you’re not sitting there holding up the line trying to pick your tickets, you can get the four best available. As a Redbox customer you can go home and use your e-mail to print your tickets or you can go to will-call and get your tickets for a dollar fee. It doesn’t matter if it’s a $500 transaction, it’s still just a dollar fee to you; Coinstar would earn a sales commission off of the tickets, plus the dollar fee. We don’t take the inventory risk and we get access to inventory.
We are also launching Redbox Instant with our partner Verizon, which is a subscription service that gives you a certain number of nights at the kiosks as well as the ability to stream unlimited movie content. Again, it is extending the Redbox brand in a way that makes sense, as our partnership with Verizon gives us access to content and technical background in order to bring our consumers who love new-release content the ability to stream some of the older releases.
So we have six organic seeds that we run like a venture. The GMs have venture advisory boards that they report to which are made up of internal and external folks. There’s a set budget that each of these folks is given, and criteria they have to hit which line up with similar progressions that we did with the Coinstar and Redbox businesses. If they’re not hitting those targets then money can get pulled away and put onto other ventures or their venture can get shut down. In that regard, it is the survival of the fittest, which is how we want it in order to get products to market in a way that make sense and continues to extend out the brand.
Our Rubi coffee kiosks are the first to come out of the gate in 2013, but it’s not the pump pots of coffee sitting on the counter at your grocery store. You can get a great cup of freshly ground and brewed coffee for one dollar or latte-style beverages for $1.50, and it’s a good location in front of grocery stores. We’re partnering with Seattle’s Best, which is a Starbucks brand, and you’ll see our Rubi coffee kiosks out there next year. Meanwhile there are another five ventures behind that. Some won’t make it through the criteria that they need to meet, but a couple will survive as we look to double the size of the company over the next five years.
We’ve talked about some innovative ideas here. What role do you as CFO play in this strategic, innovative decision-making process?
Working with our CEO and the business leaders as a partnership really drives the overall strategic direction of the company. The role that I have at Coinstar is a broader one than your traditional CFO role at most companies, because in addition to the traditional duties I also have the supply chain. I have what we call our Chief Performance Office, which our employment teams, our customer service teams and our lean teams report to.  I also have the PR team as well as Investor Relations and internal communications.
It is a broader role, and in working with our CEO and others it’s really about setting the overall core strategy of the business and how we’re going to double the business in five years, and then double the business again after that in a practical way and that gets a great return for our shareholders. It’s exciting to be part of the point of the spear that drives that strategy as we go forward.
What role does culture play in your success at Coinstar?
We have a culture built around respect, accountability and offering great products for our consumers and retail partners. If you create the right atmosphere then the employees win, your consumers win, your partners win and your investors win because you will get great return. As they become leaders in their spaces a lot of companies don’t nurture their ecosystem, and eventually the ecosystem and the company gets sick. We’ve really tried to figure out how we can continue to nurture the ecosystem in the places that we go, while getting the right returns for our shareholders. I think we’ve shown the health of our ecosystem in the coin business and Redbox business, where we have much better relationships with our studio partners than we did several years ago. They now see the value of us in the supply chain, in the channel and in the amount of dollars that come through. Our retail partners also see the great value of us increasing their foot traffic and increasing their profits with a very small footprint in their stores.
With our employees, we continue to offer them great careers and the ability to move through the organization and perhaps go from the coin business to the Redbox business, or vice versa. As we broaden those product offerings out, it opens up a host of great opportunities for our employees to continue to evolve.
The other thing that we’ve done in the last couple of years is open an office focused around corporate social responsibility and sustainability. And we were looking at sustainability issues even before that office was opened. For example, we have a remanufacturing plant in Kent that can refurbish the coin and Redbox machines and put them back out. We would fill one of those big huge dumpsters with trash about once every week or two, whereas now we fill one of those dumpsters once a year. So we moved toward recycling, but did that through a business lens. Then as we brought our sustainability team onboard we knew that consumers want you to be green, but it has to have the return on it. So at our Kent manufacturing plant we showed that we could win from the business perspective, from the sustainability perspective and from the consumer perspective.
I’m sure that while it is exciting to undergo such rapid growth it is also a challenge, right?
Yes, because we have folks in different places. The company's headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, while Redbox is based in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois, so you have a large line of business that is 1,800 miles away. We want them to have their corporate culture, but also overlay the Coinstar culture and setup new business ventures. There’s three or so in the Washington area, three or so in Oakbrook Terrace, while our strategic investments are in California, so it is a challenge to stay focused on the culture. We also have more than  1,800 field folks that are out servicing the kiosks and the Redbox business, filling the kiosks on a weekly basis and thinning them out. Not only do you have these two main areas of concentration of employees in Washington and in the Chicago area, but you also have a whole host of people around the country that you have to work with.
You’re investing in other retail services like Rubi coffee kiosks, Orango, Star Studios, ecoATM. Seeing that CFOs spend more than half of their time on the strategic aspects of their companies, what has been your role in planning and execution of expansions?
The CEO, myself, the general counsel and our head of new ventures are the primary members on an innovation council, where we look at how all the ventures are doing as well as the new concepts that are out there. So the ability to partner with teams to set the strategic direction of the company, and determine the right levels of investment to make in that, has been a lot of fun.
I’m also working with the CEO about setting the overall strategic direction on where we want to go with the company and how we’re going to play in the automated retail space. When you say automated retail, most people think of the self-service at the airports or the grocery stores. What we do is build relationships up through an automated retail solution. Now we’re looking at what does that really mean, how does that fit in the overall self-service market – which IHL estimates will grow to more than $1 Trillion by 2015 – and how does that fit into where these trends are going?  So in 2013 we’re looking to provide a much bigger vision of the company both internally, because that gives us opportunities to grow for many years, as well as externally, because the Redbox business is large, fast-growing and high-profile.
When it comes to the streaming aspect, how do you see that offering stacking up against other players like Netflix or Comcast?
I think it’s a confusing space for consumers. When you talk about streaming, people think about video-on-demand, they think new releases. Subscription streaming or digitalization is not new release content, it’s library content, so when people say that competitors stream new release movies, the fact is they don’t. On a subscription basis it’s video-on-demand; you can buy them in an electronic version through EST. What we’re going to do with Redbox is offer new release content at the kiosks packaged with unlimited streaming. We call it movies that matter. Where we will be different is that the value proposition that we’re focused on is movies, and the fact that you get instant gratification because you get new release content at the kiosks, in your hands, when you want them. And you get great streaming content when you want that from a library perspective.
We have about 40 million e-mail addresses today, and we communicate with about one-third of those on a weekly basis, telling them what’s in the kiosks, what’s happening, those kind of things. We’re getting better at narrowing down the targets around that Redbox Instant business, and we think there are a lot of opportunities to expand that business and drive it. When we talk about doubling the business in five years, roughly half of that growth will come from our Redbox business and roughly half will come from our new venture businesses.  So it’s a relatively substantial revenue number that needs to get hit, and the big growth movers are going to be the core Redbox business, along with Redbox Instant and a few other things that we’ll test and work through over the next couple of years.
What role does emerging markets play in the doubling of revenue?
We’re starting to take a look at where we want to go from an international perspective. We believe that a lot of the new ventures have great expansion opportunities internationally at a much lower saturation rate than what we did with Coinstar coin counting kiosks and Redbox. Already the coin business is in the UK, Ireland and Canada, while the Redbox business is expanding into Canada. We’re looking at other opportunities for the Redbox business internationally, while there are good opportunities in other parts of the world for high-value coin and coffee.
We don’t have a burgeoning international organization and we don’t necessarily count on the international market as we look at our five-year plan. But we’re in the process of putting together that international strategy in a way that’s efficient and able to get us to the number we need.
Before we conclude is there anything else you like to address?
It’s interesting as you look at how companies have evolved in this automated retail space and what that really means, because it is a two-way dialogue with our consumers. As I said, we have about 40 million e-mail addresses, and we talk to one-third of those customers on a weekly basis. We also have a larger Facebook presence than some of the bigger companies out there, and we have a club of people who are texted on a regular basis to get their promotion and those kinds of things. So what we’ve been able to do is start with a kiosk and convert that into a relationship. We want to establish a relationship with the consumer and build loyalty with them without overstepping the bounds. Coinstar has done a great job at being able to evolve that, and as we move forward in these other businesses we want to have the same kind of connection.
The other thing the company has stayed focused on is building out our ecosystem and providing great profitability in a very small footprint for our retail partners. And these new businesses coming up will bring new and different types of customers to our different partners and help us move into new channels. We’ll be doing some exciting things in the next several years. We’re evolving what Coinstar means to both our consumers, retailers and employees by trying to stay focused on the right things and making it a great place to work. We think it will be a great experience for our consumers and will allow the whole ecosystem to be successful.

An Interview With Scott Di Valerio, CEO of Coinstar 
Coinstar’s newly-minted CEO discusses automated retail and his company’s plans for expansion.











                Austin Smith
            

                (TMFBWItime)



            
            Jul 8, 2013 at 12:35PM
            
            





The Motley Fool is on the road in Seattle! Recently we visited Coinstar -- now officially renamed Outerwall (NASDAQ:OUTR) -- to speak with CFO-turned-CEO Scott Di Valerio about the 22-year-old company's well-known coin-cashing machines, as well as its more recent acquisition of Redbox, and future initiatives to expand into other aspects of the automated retail market.
In this interview, Scott chats with The Fool about the economics of coin and video kiosks, Coinstar's share repurchase program, and its exciting initiatives in a number of new automated retail spaces as well as related online services. From coffee and breakfast to cosmetics and photo shoots, Coinstar is looking to move into much more than coins and video.
A full transcript follows the video.

Austin Smith: Scott, thanks so much for joining us today.
Scott Di Valerio: Thanks, I appreciate you being here.





Austin: Thanks for having us.
Newly in the CEO role, came up from the CFO ranks -- I'm wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about that transition and what it's like now that you're steering the ship?
Di Valerio: Yeah. It's been a lot of fun. I've been on the team for three-and-a-half years, so really working hard to set the strategy with our executive team and coming in as the CEO, working with that team to continue to push forward.
The good thing is we have a good, strong strategy that's leveraging our leadership in automated retail. We're focusing across six sectors that we set up. That gives us about a $16 billion revenue sweet spot for us in the automated retail space, in an $85 billion market.





We're really setting course with our team to be able to get after that part of the business.
Austin: When you say $85 billion, is that what you see as the addressable market for automated retail?
Di Valerio: For automated retail, yes. Then when we narrow it down to the six sectors that we're looking at and the sweet spots that we think we can get after, it's around $16 billion. With some adjacencies around it, it'll go out to around $20 billion, so we've got a nice, big market for us to get after, and being a leader will allow us to get after it pretty quickly.
Austin: Nice to have those good runways.





Di Valerio: That's right.
Austin: You said you were looking at all these markets. If you look five years out in all of your adjacent markets, where do you see automated retail five years from today, both from your perspective, and from an industry perspective?
Di Valerio: I think automated retail really plays into the trends that we're seeing here -- urbanization, the 24/7 gratification that people want -- as well as people getting very comfortable with technology, and technology getting very good so that we can deliver products and services in a kiosk format or automated retail format.
I think people are getting much more used to getting products and services from an automated retail format. I see it expanding out.
One of the things we do at Coinstar, and have done, is we develop a relationship with our customers through the automated retail solution or the kisosk.
We do that through our email capture, and being able to have communication back and forth with them through having a good customer experience, to where people go to stores -- certain stores and certain kiosks -- because they've developed a relationship with Redbox or with Coinstar. We're going to look to continue to do that with some of our other products as well, as we bring it in the marketplace.
As we look out, we see it continuing to expand. We see it as being a way to sit in between that brick-and-mortar and the Web fulfillment. There's lots of opportunities for us in areas that we haven't even addressed yet.
Austin: You said you're neatly positioned between bricks-and-mortar and that Web experience. Those seem to be industries that have a lot of "once great" success stories here. There's a lot of once-great retailers out there; companies like Sears or J.C. Penney. There's also a lot of once-great tech companies out there: Apple famously down, Microsoft's not done a lot the past few years.
Given that you guys are at the intersection of that, what are you doing, as an executive and as a company, to continue the creative machine, to make sure that you guys stay relevant and avoid the pitfalls that are inherent in both of those industries?
Di Valerio: One of the things we always do is we start with the customer. We do a lot of work trying to understand what customer trends are, and what our customers want, and what new customers that would be coming to us would want.
We start there, and then start building backwards, about how do we develop a solution? If you look at our core businesses, the coin business, we're rolling out our PayPal solution, where you're able to load up your PayPal account with coins or cash, or withdraw from your PayPal account as well at our Coinstar machines.
What that does is open up Internet merchandising, or merchandisers, to maybe the under-banked and non-banked customers there, by being able to fill out your PayPal. Again, some adjacencies and extensions onto our business, that's physical, moving into the Web world.
If you think about our Redbox business, we have our tickets business that we're testing out, we have Reserve Online, so we're always stepping out past what we're doing from the physical presence as well.
We have a team that's really focused around new business ventures. We have Rubi -- which you guys have tasted -- the Rubi machine, our coffee business.
Austin: The reviews were good.
Di Valerio: That's right, good. Yeah, we have Crisp Market, which is prepared food in the breakfast and lunch daypart, and we have Star Studio, which is in the mall channel, which is a whole new take on photo booth, so green screens and music and fun, really geared toward the teenager that goes to the mall -- particularly the teen girls that go to the mall -- and making it a fun experience for them.
We continue to stretch out around those kinds of businesses in order to be able to bring new customers to the Coinstar brand, but also to bring new products to our customers and continue to extend out that relationship that we have with them.
Austin: It sounds like a lot of new products. I believe Rubi is, what, a partnership with Starbucks as well, right? Seattle's Best is a Starbucks label?
Di Valerio: Seattle's Best is a Starbucks label. We have an agreement with Seattle's Best in certain channels, to provide beans as well as to brand the machines. We certainly are a very good partner with them, but Rubi is 100% owned by Coinstar; we've generated business. It's a partnership that we have with them in bean supply, as well as obviously brand across key channels.
Austin: OK, so it looks like we have Rubi, some sort of food-based vending machines, and some photo-based vending machines. If you were to pick a "favorite child," so to speak, which one do you think has the most growth? Which one are you the most excited about, going out a few years?
Di Valerio: Certainly our Rubi machines. The other businesses are relatively early-stage businesses.
It's always hard to say, "OK, which one's going to hit?" Again, Crisp Market is performing well in the couple of stores that they're in today, the couple offices that they're in today. Star Studio is in around 60-70 mall locations and doing quite well, so we think that could be a nice business there.
We also have a business we call Sample It, which is beauty samples, today. Think about paying a dollar at a CVS or a Walgreen's [(NASDAQ:WBA)] for a couple samples of a cosmetic and a coupon. Not only do you, for a dollar, get to try out whether the product is going to work for you, but then you get a coupon to be able to purchase it.
The machines we have in market there are performing well, and the coupon redemption is quite high, which the brands love, as well as the retailers. In fact, Walgreen's just opened a brand-new banner store in downtown Boston and the sample machine was built into the store there, and again was a key focal point as they opened up the store.
Austin: Sample It! -- it seems like you've got some friendships with Walgreen's. I know you have a lot of kiosks with them. What other brands are people sampling? Is it Avon, is it... ?
Di Valerio: Yeah. Right now it's geared on beauty. We think it can extend to personal care and then on past that as well.
If you go into a Sample It! there will be a fragrance product from Halle Berry with the Halle Berry brand, Beyonce has branded products in there. It's across a number of the different traditional cosmetic brands. There's face products, there are fragrances, there are lotions, those kinds of things.
It's, again, starting there. Small samples you can test out, eye care products, see if it works for you and then be able to go back and buy the regular size.
Austin: Great. I want to talk about the specter in the room of Redbox; obviously your cash-cow business, you've had a lot of success with it, but a lot of the naysayers would say, "You guys are already at 50% market share, and the DVD rental industry is an eroding space."
I'm wondering, what is it about Redbox, and Coinstar in general, that is going to... what would you say to the naysayers who are looking at this industry and saying, "Well, it's eroding. How are you guys going to maintain relevance?"
Di Valerio: Certainly. One of the key things with the Redbox business is we continue to grow our market share and continue to increase overall rents by focusing on the customer and bringing a great new release product to the customer.
There's not a company that can deliver a new release product at the price point we do, and I think our customers are rewarding us for that. The first quarter of 2013, we have 40 million unique credit card transactions, which was up a million from the fourth quarter of 2012 and up over 6% from the year before, so we're growing our customer base.
We rented nearly 200 million discs in the first quarter, so we're continuing to grow out that business; that was an increase. What we're seeing, the NPD data shows that there's a slowing -- the decline in the physical rental market -- as the market has absorbed the demise of the brick-and-mortar stores, where lots of rentals were going, the national chains, and have converted to Redbox, for the most part.
You're seeing revenues come down in the rental market, but those revenues are coming down in large part because of the price point differential from, when you went to brick-and-mortar, you paid a higher price point than the $1.20 or $1.50 that you do at Redbox.
Austin: OK. I'm wondering if you could discuss the economics of your different kiosks, maybe useful life, the revenue generation that you see out of them, if you could, maybe across your big ones -- Coinstar, Redbox, Rubi.
Di Valerio: You bet. The Redbox kiosk is a kiosk that costs us about $15,000 to manufacture and put into the market. It pays back for itself in about 18 to 24 months. It begins positive cash flow in about eight to 12 months, so it's a very nice machine.
They start off, from a ramp perspective, $35,000 in year one in revenue, $50[,000] in year two and $55[,000] in year three, so it's a nice ramp-up business that returns on itself quite nicely, and continues to go out from that perspective.
The useful life of the machines, we have Redbox machines that have been in market since the start. We certainly bring machines in and refurbish them and do those types of things over time, but they're very stable, very long-lasting machines, and have been built quite well from that perspective.
Uptimes are extremely high on both the coin and the Redbox machines. In fact, on the Redbox machines about 85%-90% of any issues we have with the machines are resolved remotely, from our network operating center. There's very few break-fix services that go out on the machines.
The same is true with the Coinstar machine. Again, very high uptime on those. All the machines are connected wirelessly, so we communicate with the machines routinely during the day. We can fix issues on the machines routinely.
Again, it's a quite nice business. The coin machines are in the $11[,000]-$12,000-kiosk range.
Austin: That's cost to build?
Di Valerio: Cost to build. They pay back in a little bit longer time than the Redbox machine because it's got fewer transactions going through, but again we've had coin machines in the marketplace... 22 years that we've been in the business, we've had machines that are in the marketplace 15 years. They're very solid.
We're always having to replace monitors and upgrades, and do those kinds of things on a refurb basis, but they're very strong, long-lasting machines with high uptime.
Austin: Great. You guys, it seems, have retail relationships with everybody. You've got Safeway, Wal-Mart, CVS, Walgreen's I think we talked about earlier. I'm sure they're all great partners, but what's your favorite retail partner and why?
Is there one that just provides really great entry points for you, that you really enjoy working with, or do you see a lot of use from your machines at certain locations?
Di Valerio: It really depends on the business. For the coin business, what we've found is grocery and mass merch is the best way to go. It has enough traffic and has a high enough traffic pace to where people come into the stores and utilize machines and those kinds of things. The drug and convenience channel really don't work for the coin business.
We look at it from that perspective. A new, emerging market for us -- channel for us, I should say -- for the coin business is the financial institution business. We just put 350 kiosks in, in TD Bank Canada, and are processing points for TD Bank, and we're looking to expand.
We have a few machines in the U.S. today in the banking or financial institution channel and we're looking to expand that out as we go out.
It really depends on business from a channel perspective. When we look at Redbox, for example, we're in the grocery channel, we're in the mass merch channel, we're in convenience, and we're in drug, but we have the machines located at different places.
For convenience and drug, we're primarily outdoors. What that allows us to do is be open for 24 hours a day, it allows customers to see the machine, and it gets the right amount of traffic, both for us and as well for our retailers. And, again, it utilizes space that's very underutilized and turns it into very profitable space as well.
We really do focus based on the channel. If I look at some of our new businesses like Rubi, the grocery channel will be a very good channel for us. The mass merch channel will be a very good channel for us as well. I think we really do try to take a look at it based on the channels, as opposed to an individual retailer that's out there.
Austin: It's the right channel, the right placement, and the right machine is really what dictates it.
Di Valerio: Exactly.
Austin: Who would be the best retail partner that you don't already have? Who do you really want to become a partner with, that you haven't already tied the knot?
Di Valerio: We're very fortunate in the Redbox business, for example, that we have the top 10 national grocery chains under our banners. We have Wal-Mart, which is the largest mass merch center, as well as CVS and Walgreen's in the drug channel, and 7-Eleven and Circle K in convenience, so we have very, very strong channel space there.
With the coin business, we have nine of the 10 grocery chains under the coin banner, and Wal-Mart as well in the mass merch, so we have very strong relationships, as you've mentioned, across there. Certainly there are a couple on the coin side.
There's one grocery chain that we don't have, which we would love to bring up underneath the banner, which is Publix. Certainly, we always are looking and talking to Target as another large mass merch, to see if there are some opportunities with them for some of our businesses on a general basis.
Austin: OK. I wanted to talk a little bit about the progress of Redbox Instant and your partnership with Verizon [(NYSE:VZ)]. I'm wondering if you could maybe just elaborate on that, any progress you guys have going there, or what you're seeing as the early results?
Di Valerio: You bet. Yeah, we're very pleased with our partnership with Verizon, to bring Redbox Instant to the marketplace. We signed that deal in February of 2012, and about 15 months later were able to launch a product through kind of a beta, general availability. We're pleased with it so far.
One of the things we've been really doing is trying to understand from the customer, is there enough content between the around 5,000 titles that you have on the streaming side, as well as getting great new release content from the kiosk?
The surveys from our customers are saying yes, there's enough content, and they're finding great new-release content because you get four nights at the kiosk each month on the subscription, as well as the streaming, as we think about the business; that's both from customers who have stayed on and are paid subscribers, as well as ones who churned out of the business, so we're always trying to find the best mix there.
One of the great things about the Redbox Instant business is you basically have the full old brick-and-mortar store available to you.
If you think about it, when you used to go to a brick-and-mortar store you'd walk around the outside walls because that's where the new-release content was. We've taken that new-release content, and that's Redbox. Basically we've taken those outside walls and put them into 12 square feet. With Redbox Instant, we now have the center of the store available to our customers.
We think it's a great opportunity for our customers, it's a great value for our customers today at $8 for four standard-def rentals a month, plus unlimited streaming, or $9 for Blu-ray, for four nights at the kiosk.
We're really pleased; we think it's a great value for our customers, and as we roll into the third quarter, Redbox Instant will do a lot more work around promoting the service as we've brought on more CE device manufacturers so that people are going to get that 10-foot experience for being able to get it up on the TV in a much broader way.
Austin: Now, obviously there's a lot of incumbents in the streaming space. We can't talk about this without saying Netflix [(NASDAQ:NFLX)] and Amazon [(NASDAQ:AMZN)] Prime. Are they your biggest competitors here, or am I misreading it? Do you think about it differently?
Di Valerio: Yeah, I think our competitor is people's time, is what we look at. What are people going to choose to do for their entertainment value? Certainly those folks are in that space across there, plus a whole host of other people as well.
We think we are very well positioned because, for customers who love movies, you've got a service where you get new-release content. We're the only service that can bring new-release content, and the physical aspect of it, as well as the streaming in there.
What you're really doing is getting real new-release content when you want it, how you want it, and then be able to get your stream from around that.
Again, we're doing the business in a different way than some of the competitors on the streaming side. We are paying for content on a per-subscriber basis, which means each subscriber we bring on for Redbox Instant is gross margin positive.
It's different than... A lot of our competitors are buying content up front and having to build up the subscriber base in order to be able to cover off the costs, so they run negative a much longer time period than we will, from a profitability standpoint.
Because of the way that we're structured and running the business, we can be the No. 3 or No. 4 streaming business, and still be very, very successful, both for us and for Verizon.
Austin: It's because of that margin dynamic.
Di Valerio: The margin dynamic, and the fact that we're combining new-release content at the kiosk, on a physical basis, along with the stream, which is something that people are finding very compelling.
Austin: Now, the new-release issue has definitely been a user negative, leveled against Netflix and Verizon. What is it about you guys that allows you to bring new releases to users? I think a lot of people aren't really familiar with the dynamic of why some of the streaming people have to wait and why you're able to get the new-release content out there earlier, in front of users.
Di Valerio: There's a couple of ways to get new-release content from the studios. One is physical, which certainly we do here at the kiosk, and are really focused on that as a company. The other way is through what they call paid video on demand -- not the subscription video on demand -- so to pay $5-$6 to view a movie at home on your TV.
Really, we provide that same content at $1.20 for standard def and $1.50 for Blu-ray. People are continuing to buy Blu-ray players at very high rates. People love to get that physical disc and put it in, because there isn't a better way, from a Blu-ray perspective, to get really high-definition-quality picture and sound. The way you get it is through the disc. You can't get that through a stream.
We feel very good about that. We obviously are focused on it, and we think that combination, as you look at Redbox Instant, combined with Redbox on the physical side, is a winning combination.
Austin: Good combo there for users.
What's next in the pipeline for Coinstar? You guys obviously are rolling out a lot of new devices, looking at new automated kiosks. What else is there for users, that they should be looking forward to over the next few years?
Di Valerio: We're going to continue to look and bring great automated retail solutions. Certainly, with our coin line of business we are rolling out the PayPal, so that's a great opportunity for people to lever their PayPal accounts and do some things they want to do there.
We also have a business in the coin business called Gift Card Exchange, where you can exchange your gift cards that you've been getting for years, at stores that you might not go to, or stores that you have a little bit of money left on those cards, and get those turned in for cash.
We think that's going to be a very interesting business for us. We're starting to roll that business out. There's around 50 kiosks in the market today and we'll expand that out over the next year to capture that, and also be looking to do that with both your physical gift card, but also your digital gift cards, to be able to be the place where you're turning in your gift cards and then we're remonetizing those out.
As I look at Redbox, for example, we're obviously beginning to roll out Redbox Instant in a broader fashion, along with Verizon. We're testing tickets out, and we're putting in some very good CRM and loyalty programs that will roll out in the third and fourth quarters that will continue to extend out that Redbox brand and value: simplicity, convenience, and entertainment.
We are the No. 1 place for people to watch new-release content. We want to be the No. 1 place that people come to for overall entertainment.
If I look at the business broader, we think there are some great opportunities to bring new products into the marketplace, but also to extend them out, both from a physical perspective as well as from an online perspective, and keep marrying those two things up as we go forward.
Austin: Great. You guys have dramatically reduced shares outstanding in just a few quarters. I think it was about 3 million shares. I'm wondering, now that you're CEO, if you could discuss the logic and strategy behind that share repurchase program and whether or not you guys are interested in continuing it?
Di Valerio: You bet. We do capital allocation on a holistic basis. You first take a look and say, "OK, I need to invest in my core businesses to continue to grow them, both from new innovations into the core businesses, as well as the existing. I need to invest in new businesses" -- like we've been talking about -- "to bring new concepts into the marketplace, and then also in infrastructure in the corporation."
You calculate out what those returns are, and also returning money to the shareholders through share buyback. We'll continue to do that. We balance those out to make sure that we're doing it in a smart way, but a way that really does drive the highest return.
Four years ago, our return on invested capital, for example, was in the low single digits. Last year we finished out at 18.3%.
Austin: Congratulations.
Di Valerio: It's a nice focus for us to continue to do that, and as we try to grow out this business -- and we've talked about doubling the size of the company over the next five years -- we're going to do that while getting our return on invested capital up to 20%, which isn't necessarily the easiest thing to do, but that's how we stay in this very structured and balanced approach to getting returns for our shareholders.
Austin: Got to aim high.
Di Valerio: That's right.
Austin: What do you think is the single biggest thing that retail investors may be missing, or should know, about Coinstar today?
Di Valerio: It's a business that really focuses on its customer, and it's a business that is very operationally sound, and a business that continues to be inventive, innovative, and to bring new products to the market that customers want, and do it in a way that's efficient and effective, that's driving top-line and bottom-line growth.
If you look at our business, we've grown double-digits over the last four or five years, both top line and bottom line, and we've driven great free cash flow: well over $250 million of free cash flow last year, we'll generate between $185 [million] and $205 million of free cash flow this year.
It's a business that's very strong, very growth-oriented, but we're growing profitability at the same time we're growing revenue and free cash flows, which is, again, a business that is very good to run. It's a business that should be very good to invest in, and one that's probably a little bit misunderstood, given the fact that we have a lot of great businesses and we're in a business that we think is going to continue to grow, and grow quite rapidly.
