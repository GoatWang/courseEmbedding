 What Abdiel does
Abdiel generally invests in publicly traded companies that are likely to gain market share over long time periods. We prefer businesses that have recurring revenue and that are managed by people with a large share of their net worth in the stock. Our ten largest investments frequently comprise more than 75% of invested capital. We started in 2006.
 



What we want for our investors
Returns that are good on an absolute basis and that outperform the market, measured over 3-5 years.
How we value companies
We estimate the return a company’s cash flows would deliver to someone who bought the entire business at the available stock price and held it permanently.
What we look for “under the hood” of companies
The same thing we look for in our own. Leaders who care viscerally about the quality of the products they sell. A corporate culture in which people thrive. Coincidence or not, in our experience we make more money with companies we admire than with those we don’t.

What we want for the people who work at Abdiel
We look for unusually smart people for whom research is fun. We want to alter their trajectories, so that they live bigger lives than if they had gone to work somewhere else.
What we want Abdiel to add to the world
Work done well and with pleasure. The craftsman is a better person for his efforts, and so is anyone who notices. Moreover, good investment analysis helps companies raise the world’s standard of living. Enterprises work best when they have access to capital priced to reflect the value they can create. Index funds, by the way, do not price capital; they only mimic the actions of those who do.

Abdiel Capital Advisors LP


                  Abdiel Capital Advisors seeks over a three- to five-year time horizon to deliver attractive absolute returns and to outperform the U.S. equity markets while minimizing the likelihood of permanent impairment of the funds’ capital. The preferred method for doing is to invest capital for the long-term in a concentrated portfolio of good businesses. The portfolio typically comprises 10 to 20 common stocks issued in global, developed-market countries. Abdiel Capital may have other investments but they will usually remain a relatively small percentage of the portfolio. The firm does not restrict itself to particular geographies, industries, or asset classes. On occasion, the firm may make investments other than in equity securities and other than in good businesses held for the long-term. Abdiel Capital's propensity to do so will depend on the attractiveness of specific opportunities in other asset classes. Examples of such asset classes include options, fixed income securities, and special situations such as merger arbitrage, spinoffs, recapitalizations, and liquidations. They may also sell securities short.

 Educational Background



BA in Economics, summa cum laude 


Duke University

                  Duke University is an academic university that offers undergraduate, graduate and professional programs. It also has publications and research services. The university was founded in 1838 and is headquartered in Durham, NC.                




M.Stud. in Modern History 


University of Oxford

                  Oxford is a collegiate university, consisting of the central University and colleges. The central University is composed of academic departments and research centres, administrative departments, libraries and museums. The 38 colleges are self-governing and financially independent institutions, which are related to the central University in a federal system. There are also six permanent private halls, which were founded by different Christian denominations and which still retain their Christian character.                




Graduate, Order of the Coif 


Stanford University - Stanford Law School

                  Stanford began offering a curriculum in legal studies in 1893, when the university engaged its first two law professors. One was Benjamin Harrison, former President of the United States, who delivered a landmark series of lectures on the Constitution. The other was Nathan Abbott, who served as head of the nascent law program. Abbott assembled a small faculty to which he imparted a standard of rigor and excellence that endures to this day.In an effort to acknowledge the emerging professional nature of the department, Stanford's Board of Trustees passed a resolution in 1908 to substitute the term 'law school' for 'law department,' though technically the law program remained a department within the university.The law school was at the forefront of efforts to institute the California Bar exam, which was added to the requirements to practice law in California in 1919. The law school was accredited by the American Bar Association in 1923, the year the ABA began certifying law schools.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
