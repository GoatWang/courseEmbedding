an appropriate public retraction or correction. Each of the Parties

Section 9 shall include having such provisions specifically
enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being
acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach
shall cause irreparable injury to the non-breaching Party and that
money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to such

instruments of transfer, assignment, consents, conveyance,
assumption and delivery, and take such other actions as reasonably

agrees to comply with the terms of any engagement letter with any

or willful misconduct), or (ii) bad faith failure to comply
with any of its obligations set forth in this

the claim is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the

or proceeding.
