Oberthur Technologies (OT) is a global leader in digital security solutions for the mobility space. The company has consistently been at the forefront of mobility, from the first smart cards to the latest contactless payment technologies, which equip millions of smartphones, payment cards and identity documents.
Present in the payment, telecommunications and identity markets, OT offers end-to-end solutions in the smart transactions, mobile financial services, machine-to-machine, digital identity and transport and access control fields. The group employs over 6,000 people worldwide, including close to 700 R&D staff. With more than 50 sales offices across five continents and one manufacturing hub by region, OT’s international network serves a large base of clients in 140 countries. The company generated revenue of over $1 billion in 2014.

FINDING THE RIGHT PARTNER
IN A GROWING MARKET
Advent International had already made numerous investments in the payments and Telco sectors—including Vantiv (US), WorldPay (UK), Monext (France) and Mach (Luxembourg)—and OT looked like a strong prospect in an adjacent space.
"Right from the start, we knew that Oberthur Technologies had a solid foundation for growth,” said Cédric Chateau, managing director and general manager of Advent’s Paris office. “The main payments business unit in particular showed significant potential, with its market forecast to grow at double-digit rates worldwide. We believed that this organic growth, combined with increased operational efficiencies, would create an even stronger company.”
 Beyond the promise of organic growth, particularly in emerging markets, OT stood to benefit from the future adoption of chip-and-PIN cards in the US and dual interface cards in Europe. The development of LTE (4G) SIM cards and other advanced solutions for mobile payments also boded well for the company.
We began advanced discussions with OT in early 2011, when the company was a subsidiary of a family-owned French conglomerate. We entered into exclusive negotiations in August 2011 and, together with management, acquired full control of the business in November of that year.
 
IMPROVING THE ORGANIZATION AND STREAMLINING OPERATIONS
Following our investment and the subsequent carve-out of OT, we worked closely with management to improve operations and position the company to realize new sources of growth. For example, we supported management in transitioning the company from regional business units to four core product business units in payments, telecoms, solutions and identity, each with its own management structure.
Furthermore, OT has reorganized its global manufacturing footprint to create one manufacturing hub for each major region of the world (Europe, North America, South America, Asia and Middle East/Africa). The move should yield substantial economies of scale.

 
PURSUING GROWTH
With a more efficient, well-organized operation, the company is now focused on expanding the business—both through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. In the latter area, for instance, OT acquired NagraID Security, a specialist in dynamic display cards, in August 2014. This is a unique payment card product with a dynamic “CVV” display, which is gaining strong early interest from banking customers and significantly reduces fraud in “card-not-present” payment transactions. OT has also made significant investments in manufacturing and personnel in the US to position itself for the future.
All of these initiatives have contributed to strong performance at the company. OT met or exceeded the vast majority of its sales and financial objectives in 2014, highlighted by double-digit EBITDA growth.
“I’m convinced that OT is in the right place at the right time,” said OT CEO Didier Lamouche. “We are one of the few companies able to provide world-class digital security technology embedded in any environment—paper, plastic, mobile devices, wearables, cloud—for any end-to-end solution. With Advent’s support, we are executing on our strategy and are well-positioned in a fast-growing, dynamic industry.”

Deal type
Public-to-private


Investment date
March 2014


Status
Unrealized investment

Unit4 is a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) software vendor based in the Netherlands. Traded on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange until its delisting in 2014, the company offers accounting, payroll, HR and vertical-specific software to people-centric organizations. It also owns a significant majority stake in FinancialForce.com, a fast-growing, cloud-based ERP vendor formed in partnership with Salesforce.com. With operations in 26 countries across Europe, North America, Asia Pacific and Africa, Unit4 generated revenue of €491 million in 2013.

SHARED AMBITION
TO ACCELERATE GROWTH
As part of Advent International’s proactive sourcing efforts in the ERP sector, we built a relationship with Unit4’s founder, Chris Ouwinga, and developed a shared ambition to take the company private and make the long-term investments needed to accelerate growth and innovation. We made a public offer to acquire Unit4 in November 2013 and completed the transaction in March 2014. Ouwinga and Unit4’s senior management team rolled over a portion of their equity as part of the transaction for a minority stake in the business.

“The technology industry is at an inflection point, where social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies are creating significant growth opportunities in the ERP market,” said John Woyton, a director in Advent’s London office. “In Unit4, we see a company that, with Advent’s support and investment, is well-placed to benefit from these trends.”
Two independent operating partners—Léo Apotheker, former CEO of Hewlett-Packard and co-CEO of SAP, and Bret Bolin, former CEO of Misys and P2 Energy Solutions—assisted Advent during the transaction and joined Unit4’s board following the acquisition. They were also instrumental in developing the value creation plan and are now supporting management in its execution.
 
KEY VALUE CREATION PILLARS
Unit4 now has a clear, long-range value creation plan centered on customer success, employee engagement and a high-performance culture. The plan consists of four key pillars:

Pursuing organic and inorganic growth—To expedite and accelerate product roadmaps, the company is making major investments in social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies and several new vertical-specific solutions. It is also executing a targeted acquisition strategy to consolidate the fragmented ERP industry and acquire leading-edge capabilities.
Driving operational excellence—The plan calls for methodic and continual improvements in sales-force effectiveness, brand and marketing impact, product development efficacy and efficiency, and customer success and support.
Developing FinancialForce.com—Advent has committed significant capital to build operational infrastructure capable of supporting long-term and sustainable growth. We believe FinancialForce has the potential to become a highly strategic player in the cloud ERP software market.
Investing in human capital—Soon after completing the investment, we helped Unit4’s CEO recruit a new CFO and COO and create five new group executive roles to enable more transparency. At FinancialForce, we helped bring on a new CFO and three new executives and recruited Kevin Costello, former president of Ariba, to chair the business.

Although our investment is relatively recent, Unit4 is growing in line with plan across its various business segments. “By engaging with Advent,” José Duarte, CEO of Unit4, recalls, “we found that we had the right partner—with the right industry knowledge and a long-term perspective on the business—to make our company even stronger.”

Pursuing organic and inorganic growth—To expedite and accelerate product roadmaps, the company is making major investments in social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies and several new vertical-specific solutions. It is also executing a targeted acquisition strategy to consolidate the fragmented ERP industry and acquire leading-edge capabilities.
Driving operational excellence—The plan calls for methodic and continual improvements in sales-force effectiveness, brand and marketing impact, product development efficacy and efficiency, and customer success and support.
Developing FinancialForce.com—Advent has committed significant capital to build operational infrastructure capable of supporting long-term and sustainable growth. We believe FinancialForce has the potential to become a highly strategic player in the cloud ERP software market.
Investing in human capital—Soon after completing the investment, we helped Unit4’s CEO recruit a new CFO and COO and create five new group executive roles to enable more transparency. At FinancialForce, we helped bring on a new CFO and three new executives and recruited Kevin Costello, former president of Ariba, to chair the business.

Although our investment is relatively recent, Unit4 is growing in line with plan across its various business segments. “By engaging with Advent,” José Duarte, CEO of Unit4, recalls, “we found that we had the right partner—with the right industry knowledge and a long-term perspective on the business—to make our company even stronger.”

Domestic & General Group plc (D&G) is the United Kingdom’s leading provider of extended warranty plans for household electrical goods—appliances ranging from washing machines and heating systems to televisions and satellite dishes. Founded in 1912, D&G employs about 2,500 staff and markets extended warranties for major manufacturers, including brands such as Electrolux, Hotpoint, Bosch, Sony and Hoover.

A PARTNER WITH THE RIGHT ‘LONG-TERM VIEW’
Prior to Advent’s investment, D&G was listed on the London Stock Exchange. Our team in London had been in regular contact with the management team when the company received an unsolicited approach from one of its competitors. D&G preferred to remain independent and approached Advent as a potential partner in May 2007.
As John Pearmund, who was CEO of D&G for 10 years before his retirement in April 2014, explained, "We were looking to maximize shareholder value and believed Advent took the right long-term view of what the business could achieve.” D&G’s leadership was attracted to our financial services expertise, strong collaborative approach with management and experience in executing complex transactions. We acquired the company in December 2007 following a successful public offer for its shares.
 
‘TURBOCHARGING’ A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS
In analyzing this investment, we saw a company that had built itself into the leading player in the UK market. In addition to strong cash generation and high earnings visibility, D&G had an attractive business model, with 60% of UK revenue coming from renewals of existing customer contracts.
“D&G was a real success story in the UK, and we saw an opportunity for significant expansion,” said Kevin Beeston, an Advent Operating Partner who became chairman of D&G. “We took a good business with a good strategy and turbocharged it.”

Accelerating D&G’s growth included:

A rigorous 100-day plan: Together with management, we embarked on a detailed, data-led exercise to assess the full potential of the business and prioritize initiatives. Initial efforts to quickly drive improvements in the core UK business produced EBITDA benefits 83% higher than our target.
Better data capture: By improving data capturing techniques the company was able to collect contact details of significantly more customers, D&G increased data capture by more than 50% on appliances sold by the top seven UK manufacturers.
Improved salesforce execution: Better training and management of call-center agents led to significant increases in D&G’s conversion rate on sales calls and cross-selling.
Higher retention: Driving direct debit payments (rather than one-off payments) by customers increased retention rates and the lifetime value of the customer.
International expansion: We worked with D&G to leverage its strong platform beyond the UK, winning several new international retail warranty contracts and rolling out new programs for manufacturers in Germany, Spain and Italy. International sales rose more than fourfold under our ownership.

 
VALUE-CREATION INITIATIVES
DRIVE RESULTS
Pearmund credited “the strategic and operational improvements we made with Advent’s support for the company’s growth momentum and international expansion." Under Advent’s ownership, business expanded both in D&G’s home market and abroad, with the number of covered appliances growing nearly fourfold—from 6 million to 22 million—across the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Revenue increased 97% from £310 million in fiscal 2008 to £612 million in the fiscal year ended March 2013, while operating profit more than doubled during the same period. UK sales rose 75%, even as the rest of the market contracted, and international sales grew from 10% to 22% of total revenue.
 
POSITIONING D&G
FOR FUTURE GROWTH
After working closely with D&G’s management to capture the opportunities, we began looking for a new partner that could help D&G build on these achievements and set the stage for future growth. In December 2013, we completed the sale of D&G to CVC Capital Partners, in partnership with the existing management team.
Advent Director Bram Grimmelt summed up the mutually beneficial nature of the relationship: “In our six years as an investor, we greatly enjoyed working with the D&G management team to deliver strong performance both at home and abroad and significantly expand the company’s international breadth.” The strategic initiatives undertaken by D&G under our stewardship and the sale to CVC have positioned D&G to maximize its potential in the extended warranty market.

Back

Cetip is Latin America’s largest depository of fixed-income securities and Brazil’s largest private asset clearing house. More than 15,000 institutions—including investment funds, banks, brokers, lenders, insurance companies and foreign investors—use Cetip’s registration, custody, trading and collateral management services. Headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, the company has over 4 trillion Brazilian reais (US$1.65 trillion) in assets under custody and handles over 140,000 transactions each day (as of December 2014).

FROM NON-PROFIT MUTUAL FIRM TO COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
Established as a non-profit mutual company in 1984, Cetip was charged with promoting the safety, integrity and efficiency of Brazil’s securities markets. The company was undergoing demutualization to become a private, for-profit enterprise in 2008, just as the global financial crisis was gathering steam. Its financial institution shareholders—many of which were also customers—first considered testing the IPO market, then explored a partial private sale. But the uncertain environment made it difficult to find investors, and what began as a competitive sale process evolved into an exclusive transaction between Cetip and Advent International.
“After following Cetip for many months, we had gained an understanding of the challenges and opportunities it faced post-demutualization,” recalls Mario Malta, a managing director in Advent’s São Paulo office. “We also had relevant sector experience from prior investments in BondDesk [fixed-income trading] and GFI Group [OTC derivatives], so we were confident in the resiliency of Cetip’s business model and had the conviction to proceed with the investment despite the market upheaval.”
Through a complex outreach process, we asked each of Cetip’s 600-plus shareholders to consider our investment proposal. In May 2009, we acquired 32% of the company, becoming its largest investor. We worked with the other shareholders to implement a new corporate governance structure, which created alignment among all parties and proved critical to the success of the deal.

 
UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL
OF DEMUTUALIZATION
At the time of our investment, Cetip was already Brazil’s largest depository for private fixed-income securities and the largest clearing house for OTC derivatives. We saw an economy that was underleveraged, suggesting opportunities for organic growth. Moreover, we believed that demutualization could be a game-changer—helping to energize the company and instill a culture of innovation.
To that end, we helped bolster the management team with the addition of a number of senior executives who had significant experience in the relevant financial markets. In the words of then CFO Francisco Gomes, Advent helped “put in place people who were focused on growth and innovation.” To strengthen corporate governance and bring best practices from developed markets, we appointed Robert Slaymaker, former CEO of BondDesk and an Advent operating partner, to the board and created new committees responsible for management, remuneration and pricing.
Together with the expanded management team, we then focused on growth:

Developing new products and services, including risk management tools, such as collateral management solutions, and increased integration with clients’ back offices. From 2009 to 2010, Cetip’s investment in new product development as a percentage of net revenue rose by 174%.
Creating a new pricing model, helping transform Cetip from a cost center to a profit center.

LAUNCHING A NEW CHAPTER
Just five months after our investment, in October 2009, we helped Cetip realize its goal of going public. We sold a portion of our shares in the IPO and later completed our exit through a block trade in January 2011 and sale of our remaining 10% stake to Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) in July 2011. During our ownership, Cetip’s net revenue and EBITDA more than tripled to R$557 million and R$376 million, respectively.
Reflecting on the investment, Malta said, “We were pleased to have helped Cetip realize its potential as a market-focused business during a critical time in its development. And we are confident ICE will prove an effective long-term partner to management in the next phase of the company’s growth.”

Priory is the UK’s leading independent provider of integrated behavioral healthcare, specialist education and social care. The company treats over 70 conditions at its network of 275 facilities. Headquartered in London, Priory employs 11,000 people.
Advent International purchased Priory from the Royal Bank of Scotland in March 2011.

POSITIONING PRIORY
FOR SUCCESS
IN A DYNAMIC INDUSTRY
As one of the UK’s premier healthcare providers, Priory had built a reputation for delivering high-quality services and outcomes. The company holds a unique competitive advantage through its experience and scale, resulting in development of innovative care pathways. These can accelerate recovery time for patients and deliver the best value for healthcare payers.
In assessing the investment, Advent saw Priory as a market leader in a recession-resistant industry with potential for long-term growth as the public sector reformed the way it provided services. Funding pressures meant that the UK’s National Health Service would have to innovate to support a growing population of people with behavioral health conditions.
“Our basic thesis was that the NHS would increasingly look for support from providers like Priory to deliver high-quality inpatient care,” said Tom Allen, a managing director at Advent in London. “We considered Priory, the market leader in self-pay behavioral health, to be ideally situated to become a partner of choice for NHS commissioners.”
Since the acquisition, we have moved quickly to help Priory strengthen its capabilities. The company has invested heavily in building its quality and compliance teams and is continually looking to improve treatment models. Further, to support organic growth and respond more effectively to customer needs, Priory has enhanced its sales, marketing and business development teams.

CONSOLIDATING A FRAGMENTED MARKET
A key component of our value-creation plan was to consolidate the UK’s fragmented behavioral healthcare sector to create an integrated provider of health and social care. The first company Priory acquired, in April 2011, was Craegmoor, another specialized care services provider owned by Advent.
Already deep into our growth plan at Craegmoor, we saw that the business was a natural fit for Priory. The acquisition has supplemented Priory’s range of services and diversified its revenue base. By adding specialist learning disability and autism care (Craegmoor’s strengths) as a new division, Priory has extended its existing care pathways. Building on the success of this merger, we have supported Priory in making five further tuck-in acquisitions since 2011.
 
DRIVING BETTER PATIENT CARE AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Advent believes that Priory’s commercial success is built on delivering excellent care. The company’s financial and operational performance in recent years offers proof that the plan is working. Priory has achieved major improvements in Care Quality Commission ratings. As a result, revenue growth rates have been rising every year since our investment, and the company achieved record occupancy levels in 2014.
Priory’s CEO Tom Riall sees more growth ahead “as Priory and Advent continue working together to maximize the exciting opportunities before the company in the UK healthcare market.”

CARE Hospitals is the largest multi-specialty hospital chain in South and Central India, with strengths in cardiac care, neurology, nephrology and critical care. Founded in 1997, the company has 16 hospitals in nine Indian cities and ranks among India’s top five hospital chains.

TARGETING A
FAST-GROWING MARKET
India’s healthcare infrastructure remains relatively underdeveloped, despite rapid progress in other areas. As of December 2015, the country had less than one hospital bed per 1,000 people compared with the global average of 2.7, which translates into an annual shortfall of more than 50,000 beds. And, because most of India’s hospital capacity is concentrated in the major cities, many communities lack modern medical facilities.
In 2012, Advent International acquired a majority stake in CARE Hospitals with a vision of creating a regional market leader in acute care services. We were impressed by CARE’s strong footprint in South/Central India’s smaller cities and clear focus on clinical excellence and believed we could support its ambitious expansion plans based on our global experience in the healthcare sector.
“By coupling CARE’s clinical excellence and compassion with our operational expertise, we saw a tremendous opportunity to help grow the business while maintaining CARE’s strong commitment to social welfare,” said Shweta Jalan, a managing director at Advent International in Mumbai.

IMPROVING OPERATIONS
AND EXPANDING CAPACITY
Working with CARE’s talented founder-led management team, we have systematically implemented a plan to create value in the business by focusing on three key areas: (1) adding professional management to leverage the strong clinical leadership team, (2) improving operations and refurbishing core facilities, and (3) expanding bed capacity through new site development and acquisitions.

Adding professional management—To enable the founders and doctors to dedicate their efforts to clinical aspects of the business, CARE has enhanced its management team by bringing in a professional CEO and adding specialized talent across functions and hospitals.
Improving operations—Focusing on the two largest hospitals, the company has upgraded facilities and invested in marketing to increase awareness of its enhanced capabilities and expand the patient base. Across its broader network, CARE has added specialty services such as gastroenterology, general surgery, orthopedics and urology to provide comprehensive patient care.
Expanding bed capacity—To address demand and bring quality healthcare to more people, the company is debottlenecking and increasing capacity at some of its existing hospitals, building new facilities and acquiring hospitals in current and adjacent markets. For example, a new outpatient facility in Hyderabad, the largest standalone healthcare center in India, has significantly extended the range of services available to the local population. CARE is also in advanced stages of opening new hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Hi-Tech City in Hyderabad, which, coupled with the ongoing expansion at existing sites in Raipur and Pune, will add another 660 beds by the end of 2016.

With expansion plans well underway, revenue and EBITDA are on the rise, and the prospects for continued growth are promising. When the new projects come on stream, the CARE network will have grown from 12 hospitals and 1,475 beds in seven cities at the time of Advent’s original investment to 18 hospitals and approximately 2,800 beds in nine cities.
 
GIVING BACK
TO ITS COMMUNITIES
Stronger performance at CARE Hospitals means the business can dedicate more resources to supporting its local communities and underwriting the CARE Foundation, which provides primary care for about 200,000 people in South India and subsidized treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and children with congenital heart disease.
“Since the beginning,” said Dr. B. Soma Raju, co-founder, chairman and managing director of CARE Hospitals, “CARE Hospitals has been focused on clinical excellence and commitment to ethical practices and quality. Advent provides us with the resources to support the expansion of our business while maintaining our mission of providing healthcare with compassion.”

With expansion plans well underway, revenue and EBITDA are on the rise, and the prospects for continued growth are promising. When the new projects come on stream, the CARE network will have grown from 12 hospitals and 1,475 beds in seven cities at the time of Advent’s original investment to 18 hospitals and approximately 2,800 beds in nine cities.
 
GIVING BACK
TO ITS COMMUNITIES
Stronger performance at CARE Hospitals means the business can dedicate more resources to supporting its local communities and underwriting the CARE Foundation, which provides primary care for about 200,000 people in South India and subsidized treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and children with congenital heart disease.
“Since the beginning,” said Dr. B. Soma Raju, co-founder, chairman and managing director of CARE Hospitals, “CARE Hospitals has been focused on clinical excellence and commitment to ethical practices and quality. Advent provides us with the resources to support the expansion of our business while maintaining our mission of providing healthcare with compassion.”

ABC Supply is the largest wholesale distributor of roofing supplies in the United States and one of the nation’s largest distributors of complementary exterior building products. Headquartered in Beloit, Wisconsin, the company sells roofing, siding, windows, doors, gutters, rainware and related accessories for both residential and commercial use to builders and contractors. ABC generated sales of over $5 billion in 2014 and as of March 31, 2015, had more than 490 branches in 49 US states, employing approximately 7,000 people.

SPOTTING OPPORTUNITIES
AMID THE DOWNTURN
Advent International began exploring investment opportunities in building products in 2006‒07, around the time the US housing market began its historic decline. Across the home-building industry, prices were falling as suppliers and builders weathered the worst crisis in memory. Yet we believed that the roofing supply subsector would prove resilient given the relative stability of demand for repair and replacement work. We also saw opportunities to consolidate a fragmented industry.
In 2007‒08, we contacted the largest industry players, including ABC Supply (No. 1) and Bradco Supply (No. 3), about potential investments. ABC was not interested in selling a stake in its business at the time, but Bradco’s family owners were open to discussions. In August 2008, we acquired 80% of Bradco in a proprietary transaction that resulted directly from our proactive approach.
Over the next two years, we worked with Bradco’s leadership to build market share by investing in enhanced salesforce capabilities and completing four acquisitions. The team also improved the company’s cost structure, consolidated underperforming branches and optimized the balance sheet to generate attractive returns on capital.
 
MAKING A STRONG PLAYER
EVEN STRONGER
Although the housing market had yet to turn around, we still saw the potential for expansion and again looked at ABC Supply, which by that point had shifted its focus from greenfield expansion to acquisitions. While the two companies sold many of the same products, their customer bases were complementary: Bradco was strongly positioned among large national builders, while ABC had built its business around smaller contractors.
Advent Managing Director Stephen Hoffmeister recalls, “We were impressed by ABC, especially the sophistication of its management team. It was a people-oriented company, and its CEO, David Luck, was a veteran at integrating acquisitions.”
Together with Bradco and ABC, we decided that the best strategic approach was to combine the two businesses. The merger, completed in June 2010, created the country’s largest roofing and exterior building products distributor, more than 2.5 times the size of its next largest competitor. Between the rollover of our Bradco shares and an incremental investment in ABC, Advent owned about 25% of the enlarged company.

BUILDING VALUE
AS ONE COMPANY
The growth plan for the combined business centered on cross-selling ABC’s non-roofing products and private-label products in Bradco branches and Bradco’s commercial roofing products in ABC branches, making additional acquisitions and expanding into new product segments such as gutters, siding and windows.
The integration of Bradco and realization of cost synergies went even faster than planned. “We had expected the process to take 18 months, and we were able to achieve it in 12 months,” said Luck. In 2012‒13, ABC went on to acquire six more building supply wholesalers.
All of these initiatives contributed to strong growth, with the company’s EBITDA increasing 42% from 2010 to 2012. By the end of 2012, ABC had $4.7 billion in sales and approximately 460 branches, compared with Bradco’s $1.5 billion in sales and 130 branches at the time of Advent’s original investment.
 
SALE TO MAJORITY OWNER
AND LONG-TERM
GROWTH PLANS
In late 2012, ABC’s majority owner, seeing the long-term growth potential for the business, approached Advent with an attractive offer to purchase our stake. We finalized the sale in April 2013, four-and-a-half years after our original investment in Bradco. Today (March 2015), the company remains the clear No. 1 amid a recovering market.
“Joining ABC and Bradco was truly transformational, and a great win for both teams—exceeding everybody’s expectations,” said Keith Rozolis, who was ABC’s COO at the time of the merger and succeeded Luck as CEO and president in 2014. “But we’re not done yet. Our plan now is to grow to $7 billion in revenue and 700 locations, with world-class financial performance. And we want to keep behaving like a very small big company, without losing sight of the things that made us what we are today.”

Oxea is one of the largest global manufacturers of oxo intermediate chemicals and derivatives, with an annual production capacity exceeding 1.3 million tons, sales of €1.5 billion and 1,400 employees worldwide. Based in Oberhausen, Germany, the company produces more than 70 types of chemicals used in paints and coatings, lubricants, flavors, fragrances, safety glass and inks.

COMBINING NON-CORE ASSETS TO FORM A GLOBAL MARKET LEADER
Oxea was established in 2007, when Advent International acquired and consolidated several non-core assets from Celanese and Degussa (now Evonik), including a 50-50 Celanese-Degussa joint venture, that had lacked the capital and focus it needed to grow. “We believed that with sufficient funds and the right attention, this newly combined company could become a powerful industry leader,” recalls Ronald Ayles, the Frankfurt-based head of Advent’s chemicals and materials practice.
Over the next six and a half years, we worked with management and our operating partners to diversify Oxea’s product portfolio, boost capacity, create a cost-conscious, lean structure and expand its presence in both existing and new markets. During this period, revenue nearly doubled from €0.8 billion to €1.5 billion, and EBITDA increased nearly threefold. At the same time, the number of employees increased 8%.

A key part of the strategy was to broaden Oxea’s focus to include not only big-volume intermediates but also specialty chemicals—downstream derivatives that are sold in lower volumes but with higher margins. Oxea invented the oxo synthesis process for producing oxo alcohols, a significant industry development that helped elevate the company to the No. 1 position in the global merchant market.
 
FROM ‘WAIT-AND-SEE’
TO ‘CAN-DO’
In addition to pursuing a new strategy, Oxea forged a new shared leadership model and a new culture. The company was led by a three-person executive board: Dr. Martina Flöel headed operations and technology; Miguel Mantas oversaw marketing, sales, procurement and the supply chain; and Bernhard Spetsmann managed finance and IT. Dr. Reinhard Gradl, an Advent operating partner, served as executive chairman.
With Advent’s encouragement, the Oxea management team embraced a change in culture. “We became focused on getting ideas out of drawers and getting them done,” recalled Mantas.
“From the beginning,” said Dr. Flöel, “the partnership with Advent focused on value creation and growing the business in the right way. We literally touched every process in the company to improve efficiency.”
Rigorous analysis, coupled with swift decision-making, also contributed to Oxea’s success. According to Dr. Gradl, the decision to acquire a former Exxon Mobil facility in Amsterdam during the severe downturn in 2008–09 was reached after just a few weeks of intensive discussion on the pros and cons; likewise for the go-ahead to build a new plant in China. Altogether the company invested more than a quarter-billion euros in new and acquired units during Advent’s ownership.
“As soon as the strategy was defined or a project was identified as being attractive, it was implemented without hesitation,” said Dr. Gradl. “It was driven by a sense of urgency and at the same time with a constant view on the economics. And that was exciting. It enabled success.”
 
FINDING THE RIGHT HOME
FOR OXEA
By 2013, Oxea had been transformed from a collection of non-core assets into a leading global player, and the time had come for Advent to realize its investment in the business. Both our team and Oxea’s management saw the company as an attractive strategic asset for a number of potential buyers and worked to find the best fit. “We thought the business would appeal both to strategic buyers in emerging markets and petrochemical producers interested in adding to their downstream value chain,” said Ayles.
Our emphasis on relationship-building with large industry players enabled us to identify a strategic buyer fully supported by all stakeholders: Oman Oil Company (OOC). We had held talks with OOC for several years and in December 2013 completed the sale of Oxea to the company. In announcing the transaction, OOC said Oxea was a cornerstone of its strategy “to become a vertically integrated leader in downstream chemicals.” Oxea, meanwhile, benefited by gaining additional access to growth markets in Asia and the Middle East.

Sunley house capital management
Sunley House Capital Management is an investment manager focused primarily on publicly traded securities. Formed in 2014 as a subsidiary of Advent International, Sunley House seeks to produce attractive, long-term returns from a concentrated global portfolio of public investments. To develop this portfolio, we are employing Advent’s well-established private equity approach, which combines thorough research and due diligence with long-term underwriting standards.
We believe that this approach and long-term view provide a meaningful competitive advantage. In pursuing our investment strategy, we are able to utilize the significant sector expertise, investment experience and resources of Advent globally.

Investment strategy
Sunley House invests primarily in publicly traded securities of issuers in North America and Europe and selectively on a global basis in markets such as Asia and Latin America where Advent has local professionals and investment experience. We seek to identify companies that exhibit the potential for substantial capital appreciation through anticipated earnings sustainability or growth.
Our research and due diligence process focuses on a company’s potential performance over a three- to five-year horizon. In conducting our analysis, we aim to fully understand the trade-offs between the quality of a business and its growth profile relative to its valuation. Companies with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities often trade at a premium, so we look to invest when short-term uncertainty leads to valuations that we believe are attractive.

Investment process
Sunley House has developed a fundamental, research-intensive process to identify companies that we consider the most attractive target businesses. We focus principally on the same five core industry sectors as Advent:

Business & Financial Services;
Healthcare;
Industrial;
Retail, Consumer & Leisure; and
Technology, Media & Telecom

By concentrating on attractive subsectors and identifying long-term secular themes within each of these markets, we work to identify companies that we believe merit further analysis and monitoring for potential investment.
We strive to be patient, disciplined and opportunistic investors, as we believe this allows us to capitalize on short-term dislocations in the marketplace and invest in companies at times that provide the potential for the most attractive long-term returns.


 







Experienced team 




The Sunley House team consists of 11 investment professionals and three additional professionals focused on compliance, finance and operations. We also utilize the significant sector expertise, investment experience and resources of Advent’s private equity teams, comprising over 180 professionals globally, as well as the support of Advent teams involved in compliance, finance, operations and other functions.
