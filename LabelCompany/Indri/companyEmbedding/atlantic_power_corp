Overview
Atlantic Power owns and operates a diverse fleet of twenty-three power generation assets across nine states in the United States and two provinces in Canada.  The Company’s power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and other large commercial customers largely under long-term power purchase agreements, which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices.  The aggregate gross electric generation capacity of this portfolio is approximately 2,138 megawatts (MW), and the Company’s aggregate net ownership interest is approximately 1,500 MW.  Nineteen of the projects are currently operational, totaling 1,975 MW on a gross capacity basis and 1,337 MW on a net ownership basis.  The remaining four projects, all in Ontario, are not operational, three due to revised contractual arrangements with the offtaker and the other, Tunis, has a forward-starting 15-year contractual agreement that will commence between November 2017 and June 2019.
Atlantic Power trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AT and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ATP.

Fleet consists of a diverse group of 23 power projects in operation totaling 1,504 net MW, all strategically located in major U.S. and Canadian power markets
Projects are well diversified based on electricity and steam customers, regulatory jurisdictions, and regional power pools
93% of our power generation is "clean power" (21% renewable and the balance natural gas)
Demonstrated Operating Performance of Projects
Projects have a demonstrated track record of high availability and reliability
Stable Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with Strong, Diverse Utility Customers
Cash flows derived from the sale of electricity under long-term PPAs typically designed to pass through fuel cost fluctuations
Weighted-average remaining PPA term of approximately 7.6 years; managing through near-term PPA expiration and opportunistically seeking to extend PPAs prior to expiration at select projects
Approximately 69% of Project Adjusted EBITDA is generated by PPAs that expire beyond the next five years
Diversified customer base, consisting mostly of regulated electric utilities with investment-grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor's (S&P)
Strong In-House Operations and Partnerships with Experienced Operators
Approximately 80% of our projects are operated and maintained by our seasoned team at Atlantic Power
Projects not operated in house are operated and maintained through strong partnerships with recognized third-party operators in the independent power industry
Attractive Organic Growth Opportunities Around Existing Portfolio
On target to invest $10 million in 2015 for a three-year total of $29 million in projects designed to enhance value of existing projects by increasing output, reducing costs and improving efficiency
Expect to realize at least $10 million of annual incremental cash flow from these investments beginning in 2016
Compelling risk-adjusted returns on relatively modest capital requirements; shorter lag between investment and cash returns than typical development projects
Delivering on Balance Sheet Priorities
Reduced debt by a total of $817 million since year end 2013, including the company's share of debt at equity-owned projects
Cash interest savings associated with this debt reduction are more than $65 million on an annualized basis
Amortizing term loan structure results in additional deleveraging over time

Short Interest Increases 13.7% For AT
The most recent short interest data has been released by the NASDAQ for the 02/12/2016 settlement date, which shows a 639,629 share increase in total short interest for Atlantic Power Corp , to 5,315,522, an increase of 13.68% since 01/29/2016.

This Stock Has A 5.88% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
