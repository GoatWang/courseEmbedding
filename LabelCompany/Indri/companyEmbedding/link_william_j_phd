William Link, PhD


Bill Link is a Managing Director specializing in early-stage investing in medical devices at Versant. Prior to co-founding Versant Ventures, Bill was a general partner at Brentwood Venture Capital. With more than two decades of operations experience in the healthcare industry, he has a proven record of building and managing large, successful medical product companies. His extensive knowledge of medical devices, particularly in ophthalmology, has contributed to Versant’s recognized leadership in this specialty area.
Perhaps Bill’s greatest operational success was as founder, chairman and CEO of Chiron Vision, a subsidiary of Chiron Corporation specializing in ophthalmic surgical products, which was sold to Bausch and Lomb in 1997. Prior to Chiron Vision, Bill founded and served as President of American Medical Optics (AMO), a division of American Hospital Supply Corporation, which was sold to Allergan in 1986. Later Bill served on the Board of AMO’s successor company, Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) which was acquired by Abbott in 2009.
Before entering the healthcare industry, Bill was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Surgery at the Indiana University School of Medicine.

Bill is an avid aviator and truly enjoys flying, especially with his son Bradley in the cockpit and his family in the back.  The outdoors is the place Bill likes to be, whether it is hiking in the Colorado mountains with his wife, Marsha, skiing in beautiful Steamboat Springs or bird hunting with his buddies in the fall.

William J. Link, PhD, Joins Allegro Ophthalmics’ Board of Directors

November 21, 2016

Download the PDF
SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, CA —NOVEMBER 21, 2016 — Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, a biotechnology company focused on the development of novel therapies to treat vitreoretinal diseases, today announced that William J. Link, PhD, has been elected to Allegro’s board of directors.
Dr. Link is co-founder and a managing director of Versant Ventures, a global healthcare investment firm where he specializes in early stage investing in medical devices.  Prior to Versant, Dr. Link was a general partner at Brentwood Venture Capital.  With more than two decades of operations experience in the healthcare industry, Dr. Link has a proven record of building and managing large, successful medical product companies, including Chiron Vision where he was co-founder, chairman and CEO until it was sold to Bausch + Lomb in 1997.  In addition, Dr. Link founded and served as President of American Medical Optics (AMO), a division of American Hospital Supply Corporation, which was sold to Allergan in 1986.
“Bill is a pioneer in the healthcare industry and we are excited to welcome him to Allegro’s board of directors,” said Hampar Karageozian, MSc, MBA, co-founder and chief executive officer, Allegro Ophthalmics. “Bill’s vast experience and expertise in building and managing successful healthcare companies, particularly in the area of ophthalmology, will be a tremendous asset that will ensure Allegro’s continued success as we move our lead drug candidate Luminate® toward commercialization.”
“I have admired how Allegro’s dynamic leadership team has quickly and cost-effectively made significant progress in its Luminate® drug development program across multiple indications,” said Dr. Link. “With this recent progress, including last month’s news on the positive results from the DEL MAR Phase 2b DME trial, it is a very exciting time to join Allegro’s board of directors.”
About Luminate
Luminate, a first-in-class integrin peptide therapy, treats vitreoretinal diseases by targeting integrin receptors involved in cell signaling and regulation and in the construction of new and aberrant blood vessels.  By utilizing two mechanisms of action (vitreolysis and anti-angiogenesis), Luminate has been shown in clinical studies to date to effectively regress and inhibit new blood vessel formation, as well as reduce vascular leakage to maintain and restore vision.  Currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for multiple indications, including diabetic macular edema (DME) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), Luminate is an investigational drug not approved by the FDA for commercial sale in the U.S.  Allegro maintains commercial rights to Luminate in all territories outside of Japan, Korea and China.
About Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC
With more than 100 years of combined experience in ophthalmic drug discovery, development and manufacturing, Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, is working to establish integrin peptide therapy as the next-generation pharmaceutical category for the treatment of vitreoretinal diseases.  Allegro’s lead investigational drug, Luminate, is currently in Phase 2 studies and has the potential to significantly reduce the current burden of intravitreal injections and to be a viable option for patients with diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related macular degeneration, and vitreomacular traction.  By quickly, safely and cost-effectively bringing to market new and improved treatment options for leading causes of blindness, Allegro is committed to offering patients an improved quality of life sustained by self-sufficient, functional vision.

Luminate® is a registered trademark of Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

William J. Link, PhD, Joins Allegro Ophthalmics’ Board of Directors | Business Wire
























































William J. Link, PhD, Joins Allegro Ophthalmics’ Board of Directors






November 21, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, a biotechnology company focused on the 
      development of novel therapies to treat vitreoretinal diseases, today 
      announced that William J. Link, PhD, has been elected to Allegro’s board 
      of directors.
    


      Dr. Link is co-founder and a managing director of Versant Ventures, a 
      global healthcare investment firm where he specializes in early stage 
      investing in medical devices. Prior to Versant, Dr. Link was a general 
      partner at Brentwood Venture Capital. With more than two decades of 
      operations experience in the healthcare industry, Dr. Link has a proven 
      record of building and managing large, successful medical product 
      companies, including Chiron Vision where he was co-founder, chairman and 
      CEO until it was sold to Bausch + Lomb in 1997. In addition, Dr. Link 
      founded and served as President of American Medical Optics (AMO), a 
      division of American Hospital Supply Corporation, which was sold to 
      Allergan in 1986.
    

      “Bill is a pioneer in the healthcare industry and we are excited to 
      welcome him to Allegro’s board of directors,” said Hampar Karageozian, 
      MSc, MBA, co-founder and chief executive officer, Allegro Ophthalmics. 
      “Bill’s vast experience and expertise in building and managing 
      successful healthcare companies, particularly in the area of 
      ophthalmology, will be a tremendous asset that will ensure Allegro’s 
      continued success as we move our lead drug candidate Luminate® toward 
      commercialization.”
    

      “I have admired how Allegro’s dynamic leadership team has quickly and 
      cost-effectively made significant progress in its Luminate® 
      drug development program across multiple indications,” said Dr. Link. 
      “With this recent progress, including last month’s news on the positive 
      results from the DEL MAR Phase 2b DME trial, it is a very exciting time 
      to join Allegro’s board of directors.”
    

About Luminate


      Luminate, a first-in-class integrin peptide therapy, treats 
      vitreoretinal diseases by targeting integrin receptors involved in cell 
      signaling and regulation and in the construction of new and aberrant 
      blood vessels. By utilizing two mechanisms of action (vitreolysis and 
      anti-angiogenesis), Luminate has been shown in clinical studies to date 
      to effectively regress and inhibit new blood vessel formation, as well 
      as reduce vascular leakage to maintain and restore vision. Currently in 
      Phase 2 clinical trials for multiple indications, including diabetic 
      macular edema (DME) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), 
      Luminate is an investigational drug not approved by the FDA for 
      commercial sale in the U.S. Allegro maintains commercial rights to 
      Luminate in all territories outside of Japan, Korea and China.
    

About Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC


      With more than 100 years of combined experience in ophthalmic drug 
      discovery, development and manufacturing, Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, is 
      working to establish integrin peptide therapy as the next-generation 
      pharmaceutical category for the treatment of vitreoretinal diseases. 
      Allegro’s lead investigational drug, Luminate, is currently in Phase 2 
      studies and has the potential to significantly reduce the current burden 
      of intravitreal injections and to be a viable option for patients with 
      diabetic macular edema, diabetic retinopathy, wet age-related macular 
      degeneration, and vitreomacular traction. By quickly, safely and 
      cost-effectively bringing to market new and improved treatment options 
      for leading causes of blindness, Allegro is committed to offering 
      patients an improved quality of life sustained by self-sufficient, 
      functional vision. For more information, visit www.allegroeye.com.

The Glaucoma Research Foundation 2014 Catalyst Award was presented to William J. Link, PhD, a leading venture capitalist instrumental in the advancement of many important new technologies including innovative treatments for glaucoma. 

The Catalyst Award, Glaucoma Research Foundation's highest honor, recognizes exemplary leadership in sustaining innovative glaucoma research and education. The award was presented to Dr. Link on February 6, 2014 at the Glaucoma 360 Annual Gala in San Francisco.
Video transcript: 
Gene de Juan, Jr. MD (Founder and Vice Chairman, ForSight Labs): Somebody would think that you were exaggerating when you say Bill has been very much a part of most of the important innovations that have happened over the past, really fifteen, twenty years in ophthalmology, but he really has done tremendous, been involved or initiated efforts that have really changed ophthalmology. All of the very sophisticated laser treatments for refraction, the Second Sight bionic eye, all of that, he really has had a huge impact. 
Emmett Cunningham, Jr., MD, PhD, MPH (Partner, Clarus Ventures): And he's done so much of it over such a long period of time. So, 30+ years directly involved in companies that have innovated at the highest levels - AMO, Chiron Vision, then a series of private companies that he started and helped start, helped build, and take to the point where they had successful medical devices within ophthalmology.
Gene: An innovator is somebody who changes the world. And he doesn't have to be an inventor. Maybe Steve Jobs with the iPhone is an innovation because it changed the world, it changed the way we act, and I call those innovations. And I think what Bill does is he takes inventions and turns them into innovations that change the way people act. I don't think the Catalyst Award could go to somebody who has been more impactful.
Emmett: In what way does Bill exemplify the word "catalyst?" I think that he and what he does, which is venture investing, really at its core is what promotes and fuels innovation, promotes company growth, company building. So both the money he provides and the expertise he provides allows these companies, permits them to grow, to flourish, so in that sense I think he's a real catalyst for innovation.
Title: Catalyst for Innovation
William J. Link, PhD (Managing Director, Versant Ventures): I transitioned into venture capital in the late 90's after we sold a business that I had helped build named Chiron Vision to Bausch + Lomb. I had been a CEO and entrepreneur for over 20 years and I was ready to do something different. And a colleague of mine, a dear friend, invited me to look at the venture capital field. I didn't know what it was, and I was intrigued and thought I would give it a try. And since when I started in venture capital I knew a lot about ophthalmology, I probably was able to see opportunity there because of my expertise.
Title: Innovator in Ophthalmology
Bill Link: Well I got started in ophthalmology by accident. My wife Marsha and I left Indiana University where we were both on the faculty and we moved to Southern California and I got into the business side of the world. First day on the job I was just sitting in a conference room, trying to be quiet at the far end of the table, and the boss at the end of the table said "does anyone here know about these new lenses that are implanted inside the eye, they're called 'intraocular lenses?'" It was dead quiet and after a couple moments I couldn't stand it and I said, "well, Mr. Perry, I don't know about those lenses but I know an ophthalmologist" and that started my career in ophthalmology.
Title: What Makes Bill Tick?
Bill Link: Well, how important is family is an easy thought for me. Family is everything. There are a lot of ways to do well and feel good about yourself but my way is to know that the family is solid and that I've done my part. I was raised in a caring family, it made a difference in my life, I believe that I'm involved now with a family that I know I care about and we care about each other. And so if we're healthy and interactive and go through our ups and downs as a family, that's a strong base, and can be a platform for us trying this professionally, trying that professionally, and we can always go back to the family who accepts us as we are. 
Well of course there's a lot more to come, I couldn't be more fired up then I am today. The privilege I have is: my ability to have impact has never been better. And so shame on me if we don't stay focused, and look forward, and try to continue to take on tough problems, team up with good people and good clinicians, and I bet we're going to continue to make a difference.
