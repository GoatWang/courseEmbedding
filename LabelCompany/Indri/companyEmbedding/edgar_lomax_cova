The Edgar Lomax Value Fund







Welcome
The Edgar Lomax Company was opened for business in September 1986 as a registered investment advisor by Randall R. Eley, President and CIO. The firm is dedicated to serving institutional and high net worth clients through its separate accounts product, and retail clients through its mutual fund, the Edgar Lomax Value Fund. Our sole business is large-cap value equity investment management. The firm manages over $1.5 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017 and is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia.
We invest with the primary objective of obtaining the highest possible return with the lowest possible risk. Consequently, we employ a bottom-up value equity investment strategy that invests in quality businesses with long-time proven records of strong earnings and stable dividend yields. Our investment strategy is designed to fully participate in rising equity markets while limiting downside volatility.









The Edgar Lomax Value Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may also be viewed by clicking here or by calling 866-205-0524. Read it carefully before investing.
Periodic investment plans do not assure a profit and do not protect against a loss in declining markets.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. "Value" investing as a strategy may be out of favor in the market for an extended period. Value stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and from other types of stocks. 
The Edgar Lomax Value Fund is available to U.S. investors only.  Shares of the Fund are currently offered only in the U.S. and are not registered for sale in any jurisdiction other than the U.S. This is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful.
The Edgar Lomax Value Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC

The Edgar Lomax Value Fund







Welcome
The Edgar Lomax Company was opened for business in September 1986 as a registered investment advisor by Randall R. Eley, President and CIO. The firm is dedicated to serving institutional and high net worth clients through its separate accounts product, and retail clients through its mutual fund, the Edgar Lomax Value Fund. Our sole business is large-cap value equity investment management. The firm manages over $1.5 billion in assets as of March 31, 2017 and is headquartered in Springfield, Virginia.
We invest with the primary objective of obtaining the highest possible return with the lowest possible risk. Consequently, we employ a bottom-up value equity investment strategy that invests in quality businesses with long-time proven records of strong earnings and stable dividend yields. Our investment strategy is designed to fully participate in rising equity markets while limiting downside volatility.









The Edgar Lomax Value Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company, and it may also be viewed by clicking here or by calling 866-205-0524. Read it carefully before investing.
Periodic investment plans do not assure a profit and do not protect against a loss in declining markets.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. "Value" investing as a strategy may be out of favor in the market for an extended period. Value stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and from other types of stocks. 
The Edgar Lomax Value Fund is available to U.S. investors only.  Shares of the Fund are currently offered only in the U.S. and are not registered for sale in any jurisdiction other than the U.S. This is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful.
The Edgar Lomax Value Fund is distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC
