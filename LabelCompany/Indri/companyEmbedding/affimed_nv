Our  Mission
 Breakthrough cancer therapies: 
              Directing the  immune system to eliminate tumor cells.
 


 


 


 
Affimed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  focused on discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies. Its  product candidates are being developed in the field of immuno-oncology, which  represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment that seeks to harness the  body’s own immune defenses to fight tumor cells. The most potent cells of the  human defense arsenal are types of white blood cells called Natural Killer  cells, or NK-cells, and T-cells. Affimed’s proprietary, next-generation  bispecific antibodies, termed TandAbs® because of their tandem antibody  structure, are designed to direct and establish a bridge between either  NK-cells or T-cells and cancer cells. Affimed’s TandAbs have the ability to  bring NK-cells or T-cells into proximity and trigger a signal cascade that  leads to the destruction of cancer cells. Due to their novel tetravalent  architecture (which provides for four binding domains), the TandAbs bind to  their targets with high affinity and have half-lives that allow intravenous  administration. Affimed believes, based on the TandAbs mechanism of action and  the preclinical and clinical data it has generated to date, that its product  candidates may ultimately improve response rates, clinical outcomes and  survival in cancer patients and could eventually become a cornerstone of modern  targeted oncology care. 

                Affimed has focused its research and development efforts  on three proprietary programs for which it retains global commercial rights.  Because TandAbs bind with receptors that are known to be present on a number of  types of cancer cells, each of Affimed’s TandAb product candidates could be developed  for the treatment of several different cancers. Affimed intends to initially  develop its two clinical stage product candidates in orphan or high-medical  need indications, including development as a salvage therapy for patients who have relapsed  after, or are refractory to, that is who do not respond to treatment with,  standard therapies. 
                Affimed generates its pipeline of product candidates from three proprietary next-generation antibody-engineering technologies:


 


 




 
 
 


 
NK-cell       TandAbs – 
                          tetravalent, bifunctional proteins that recognize a       specific biologic target and, utilizing their second functionality, bind       with high affinity to CD16A on NK cells and thereby direct the NK-cells to       eliminate the target cell.
 


 
 
 


 


 
 
 


 
T-cell       TandAbs –  
                          tetravalent, bifunctional proteins that recognize a       specific biologic target and utilizing their second functionality, bind       with high affinity to CD3 on T-cells and thereby       direct the T-cell to eliminate the target cell.
 


 
 
 


 


 
 
 


 
 Trispecific Abs for dual targeting of tumor cells –   trifunctional structures that can be designed to target two different targets/epitopes on the tumor cell and with the third functionality bind with high affinity to either T-cells or NK-cells.

AFM13

AFM13 is a  first-in-class product for CD30-positive tumor types. 
              It will initially be  developed in the high medical need salvage 
              setting of Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Affimed has published a paper on its lead candidate AFM13 phase 1 data: 
                  Rothe, A. et al., Blood. 2015, Apr. 17, pii: blood-2014-12-614636; 
 


 


 
AFM13 
 


 

 


 


AFM13  is a TandAb recognizing CD30 and utilizing its second functionality binds with  high affinity to NK-cells and activates them. CD30 is overexpressed on Reed  Sternberg cells that are the hallmark of Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). In addition,  CD30 is also expressed on a variety of T-cell lymphomas, including cutaneous  T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Furthermore,  some 25% of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients carry the CD30  epitope. Overall, in North America, the EU and Japan, more than 50,000 patients  are diagnosed annually with diseases in which malignant cells carry the CD30  epitope. Each year, between 6,000 t0 8,000 patients with these diseases relapse or become refractory to a  series of standard treatments and require new therapeutic option.

                  Affimed  has conducted a phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in patients with relapsed / refractory HL. The clinical  results have been presented to the medical community by Prof. Engert, the lead  investigator for the study, at the Lugano International Meeting on Malignant  Lymphoma in 2013. In sum, AFM13 has been found to be safe at the  doses tested. Certain biomarkers indicated dose-dependent effects suggesting  most active doses at or above 1.5 mg/kg. Anti-tumor activity was observed  at all dose levels tested but was more pronounced at or above 1.5 mg/kg.
 
 In this subgroup (N=13), 3 partial responses  (≥50% tumor shrinkage) and 7 cases with stable disease were  observed,  resulting in an overall disease control rate of 77%. Of note, 6 of 7 patients  that were refractory to brentuximab vedotin had a stabilization of their  disease, an indication that this patient population may also benefit from AFM13  treatment. Based on these data a phase 2 study is being prepared with an  optimized dosing regimen designed to demonstrate the full therapeutic potential  of AFM13 in relapsed/refractory HL patients.
                  In  August 2013, Affimed signed an agreement with the Leukemia and Lymphoma  Society (LLS) under which LLS committed to co-fund up to $4.4 million over two years for the  phase 2a development of AFM13. In doing so, the LLS recognized  the critical need for safer and more durable therapies for HL. The LLS is  committed to advancing breakthrough therapies, particularly for patients with  unmet medical needs. The LLS is the world’s largest voluntary  health agency dedicated to blood cancer; its mission is: cure leukemia,  lymphoma, Hodgkin’s disease and myeloma, and improve the quality of life of  patients and their families. AFM13 is being developed as a monotherapy (phase 2) and in combination with Merck’s Keytruda (phase 1).


 


 


 
 
 


 


 
Medical Need in  Hodgkin Lymphoma
 


 

 


 




 
 
 


 
Despite  the advent of new therapies to treat HL patients that have relapsed, or not  responded to earlier lines of therapy, the medical need remains high. Aside  from some 34% of relapsed or refractory HL patients that appear to have a  durable response with brentuximab vedotin, an antibody-drug conjugate recently  introduced as HL salvage therapy to the market, the majority of patients –  while initially responding to therapy - relapse within a few months and need to  resort to experimental therapies. 

                        This patient population comprises between 4,000 and 5,000 new  cases every year in North America, the European Union and Japan.  Affimed’s clinical data suggest that AFM13,  due to its novel mode of action, may be active in these patients. This  indication could provide a fast path to market.
 


 
 
 


 


 
 
 


 
We plan to explore whether   AFM13 may not only be beneficial in the salvage setting, but also as part  of a regimen that is applied earlier after diagnosis, where next to efficacy,  safety is an important consideration for the choice of therapy. If clinical trials are successful AFM13 may  ultimately achieve a place among earlier-line therapies, perhaps in combination  with immunomodulators, tyrosine kinase inhibitors or with other  biologics.

                        We plan to pursue AFM13 in other CD30-positive indications such as T-cell  lymphoma, DLBCL and in other leukemias and lymphomas. CD30 expression has  been shown to range between 100% and 25% in these diseases.

AFM11

AFM11 has the  potential for high response rates and deep
                responses, similar to blinatumomab. Given by bolus infusion it
              is initially being developed in refractory aggressive NHL.

Affimed has published 
              a paper on its lead candidate  AFM11

AFM11
 
 


 


 

 


 


AFM11 is a T-cell TandAb recognizing  CD19 and utilizing its second functionality, binds with high affinity to  T-cells and activates them. CD19 is expressed on multiple B-cell malignancies,  including various forms of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Acute Lymphocytic  Leukemia (ALL).  In North America, the EU and Japan, more than 160,000 NHL  patients and 14,000 ALL patients are diagnosed annually with these diseases.
                    AFM11 is in phase 1 clinical development  in patients with relapsed / refractory B-cell NHL. Affimed is conducting a  phase 1 dose escalation study with a primary focus on safety, as well as  pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor activity. AFM11 is given by bolus infusion. 
Although there is significant  competition in NHL, a high need remains in refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell  Lymphoma (DLBCL). Until now most new therapeutic options have shown modest  response rates in these patients. However, by far the strongest effects were  seen with treatments using T-cells to fight the cancer. 
The response rates observed with this  product are about twice as high  
 
as those obtained with other experimental  treatments used currently in the salvage setting, and the complete responses  are all molecular responses, i.e. CD19-positive cells are completely ablated  such that none are detectable with the most sensitive techniques available.  Studies suggest that the absence of minimal residual disease is a predictor of  long-term outcome, and hence this observation may translate into extended  progression-free survival. 
                    In preclinical studies, AFM11 has shown  very potent cytotoxicity, even at very low T-cell counts. This differentiation  to blinatumomab may be of clinical relevance for patients whose immune system  is compromised e.g. from myelosuppressive chemotherapies, or for patients with  tumors where perfusion is restricted. Furthermore, AFM11 is administered by  regular IV-infusion and continuous infusion is not required, another  differentiation from blinatumomab, which currently is administered by  continuous infusion. In addition, Affimed has recently initiated a phase 1 clinical trial in ALL.


 


 


 
 
 


 


 
Medical Need in  Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
 


 

 


 




 
 
 


 
Despite  the progress made in the treatment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, a high medical need  remains for those patients that have relapsed from or become refractory to  standard therapies. Time to relapse with increasing lines of therapy usually  becomes shorter and shorter. Aggressive lymphoma such as Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is still difficult to treat and represents the highest medical need in NHL in the relapsed / refractory setting.  

At  least 80% of all lymphomas belong to the NHL group. Therefore, considering all  B-cell lymphoma subtypes, the total annual incidence in North America, the EU  and Japan is about 160,000 cases.
 


 
 
 


 


 
 
 


 
AFM11 is an off-the-shelf product which does not require continuous infusion. Based on the expected pharmacokinetics, AFM11 can be individually dosed in order to optimize the safety for the patients. DLBCL alone  represents about 46,000 new patients in North America, the European Union and Japan every year and currently some 20,000  patients annually relapse from or become refractory to a series of standard treatments  and require new therapeutic options.

About Affimed

Breakthrough cancer therapies: 
              Directing the  immune system to eliminate tumor cells.
 


 


 
 
 


 


 


Company Background 





 


Affimed was founded in 2000 based on technology  developed by the group of Prof. Melvyn Little at the German Cancer Research  Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg. Today, the company has  a pipeline with  two clinical-stage projects based on this technology. In 2009, Affimed set up  its wholly owned unit AbCheck in Pilsen, Czech Republic, which focuses on fully human antibody screening and optimization.  AbCheck offers its cutting-edge services to third party customers and acts  as a strategic partner to Affimed by providing integrated research. More  recently, Affimed’s partner Amphivena was set up to develop a TandAb product for Janssen based on its proprietary technology. Affimed is a public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "AFMD". 


 


Proprietary Platform Technologies





 


Affimed has three proprietary platform technologies  based on its proprietary tetravalent antibody architecture characterized by 4 binding domains:




 
Bispecific TandAbs engaging NK-cells (via CD16A) 



 
Bispecific TandAbs engaging T-cells (via CD3)



 
Trispecific Abs engaging either NK- or T- cells



These tetravalent molecules bind to tumor and  immune cells with high affinity. TandAbs are validated clinically by having  demonstrated promising therapeutic activity in patients. Trispecific Abs are validated  preclinically targeting two distinct tumor epitopes and engaging T- or NK-cells  to lyse the tumor cells that  express both targets.
Robust and efficient production processes for  TandAbs have been established in mammalian cell systems. TandAbs® show  high product stability.


 


 


Company Highlights





 


Affimed’s mission is to develop breakthrough  cancer therapies. The company’s  approach is to direct the immune system to eliminate tumor cells. Its next  generation multifunctional antibodies (TandAbs®, Trispecific Abs) engage two of  the most potent cytotoxic cells of the immune defense arsenal (T-cells or  natural killer (NK) cells) and link them with high affinity and precision to a  tumor cell, thus triggering an attack by the immune cell that ultimately  results in the destruction of the tumor cell. 

                      Highlights  of the company are:




 
Lead product candidate, AFM13, is a first-in-class NK-cell 


 
 
mediated cancer  immunotherapy.



 
Growing pipeline of product candidates focused on key cancer 


 
 
indications.



 
Retained global commercial rights for the three candidates in 


 
 
the product  pipeline.



 
Experienced  management team with a strong track record in


 
 
the development and 
commercialization  of new medicines.



 
Strong  technology base and solid patent portfolio in the field 


 
 
of targeted  immuno-oncology.




 


Product Pipeline





 


Affimed’s pipeline  product candidates AFM11, AFM13, AFM24 and AFM26 are unencumbered. Affimed retains all  options to derive value from its product candidates, including  commercialization in select markets when and if they are approved. To maximize  the value of its platform, Affimed will continue to explore partnerships to  support the development or commercialization of its programs in certain  territories.

Affimed: A Clinical-stage Biopharmaceutical Company





 


Affimed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company  focused on discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies.  Affimed’s product candidates are being developed in the field of immuno-oncology, which  represents an innovative approach to cancer treatment that seeks to harness the  body’s own immune defenses to fight tumor cells. The most potent cells of the  human defense arsenal are types of white blood cells called Natural Killer cells,  or NK-cells, and T-cells. Affimed’s proprietary, next-generation bispecific  antibodies, called TandAbs for their tandem antibody structure, are designed to  direct and establish a bridge between either NK-cells or T-cells and cancer  cells, triggering a signal cascade that leads to the destruction of cancer  cells.
                   Affimed is a public company trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol "AFMD".

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
