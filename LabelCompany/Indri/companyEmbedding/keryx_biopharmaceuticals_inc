Why Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Stock Soared 11.6% Higher in June
Sales are finding their footing at this biotech, and optimism is increasing ahead of an important FDA decision later this year.











                Todd Campbell
            

                (TMFEBCapital)



            
            Jul 8, 2017 at 6:31AM
            
            





What happened
After the biotech issued an update on its first-quarter progress in May, investors continued buying Keryx Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:KERX) shares in June, sending them 11.6% higher last month, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
So what
Keryx Biopharmaceuticals was once a high-flying biotech star, but its reliance on one commercial drug caused shares to crash when sales were slow to grow and production difficulties crimped prescriptions in 2016.

Image source: Getty Images.

Now, it appears Keryx Biopharmaceuticals is regaining some of its luster. The company's lone drug is Auryxia, a treatment that removes excess phosphorous from chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis. Phosphorous can build up in these patients, stripping away calcium from bones, weakening them, and potentially creating calcium deposits that can cause heart disease.
Auryxia launched to nine-figure sales projections, but net product sales totaled only $27.2 million in 2016. This year, however, Auryxia may begin to get closer to analysts' rosy outlook. In Q1, net product sales in the U.S. were $10.5 million, and management thinks that full-year 2017 net product sales will come in between $56 million and $60 million.
Sales could grow much bigger than that in 2018, however, if the FDA approves Auryxia's use in stage 3 to 5 chronic kidney disease patients not on dialysis. In phase 3 trials, Auryxia helped treat anemia in these patients, and the FDA has set a target action PDUFA date of Nov. 6 to decide on whether to expand the drug's label. If it does, then it will significantly increase Auryxia's addressable patient population. An estimated 1.6 million Americans with stage 3 to 5 non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease have iron deficiency anemia.





Now what
Despite revenue gaining momentum, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals continues to lose money. In Q1, spending led to a loss of $23 million and cash burn of $21 million. As a result, the company's balance of cash and cash equivalents has fallen to $90.9 million. There isn't a cash crunch yet, but Keryx could end up tapping equity markets with a stock offering later this year if sales fall shy of projections or the FDA passes on approving the expanded label.
Nevertheless, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals is an intriguing stock for bargain hunters to consider buying. The company's $850 million market cap isn't too rich of a valuation (assuming the FDA allows expanded use of Auryxia), and an argument can be made that a suitor could come knocking on its door if the FDA gives it a green light in November.

What to Expect from Keryx (KERX) this Earnings Season?

Saturday, July 22, 2017 Zacks Equity Research News, stream 


Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. KERX is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.
Last quarter, the company missed expectations by 16.7%. In fact, Keryx’s performance over the last four quarters has been disappointing. The company reported a wider-than-expected loss in all the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 39.32%.
Keryx’s share price has increased 20.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 11.2% rally.
Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.

Factors Influencing This Quarter
Apart from license fees, Keryx’s top line comprise revenues generated by its only marketed product Auryxia (ferric citrate). Auryxia is approved as tablets to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis.
Notably, with Auryxia being the only approved product in Keryx’s portfolio, the company is entirely dependent on it for growth. Launched in the U.S. in late Dec 2014, Auryxia is still in its early stages of commercialization. However, Keryx is working on its commercial efforts for Auryxia. In fact, the company is currently working on gaining formulary status for the drug. In Mar 2017, the nation’s largest Medicare Part D plan sponsor added Auryxia to its Medicare Part D plan formularies. With these formulary additions, 95% of the patients taking a phosphate binder across Medicare Part D and commercial plans now have unrestricted access to the drug.
Additionally, it is working on contracting the remaining insurance providers to expand patient access to Auryxia. This should enable more contact with the prescribers, both current physicians and those who have not prescribed Auryxia, yet. Meanwhile, Keryx expanded its field-based team to 95 sales representatives, which led to an increase in the number of dialysis patients on Auryxia.
Moreover, Keryx is working on expanding ferric citrate's (the compound name for Auryxia in additional indications) label to include the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in patients with stage III–V non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease indication (NDD CKD).
In Mar 2017, the FDA accepted the company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Auryxia for review (PDUFA date: Nov 6, 2017). If approved for this indication, Auryxia might be the first FDA-approved oral medicine to treat IDA in this patient population. We believe a potential approval will significantly boost sales of Auryxia, going forward.
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Keryx this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.
Zacks ESP: Keryx’s has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 17 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.
Zacks Rank: Keryx’s has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult for the quarter.
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement.

Stocks to Consider
Here are some health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.
Agenus Inc. AGEN has an Earnings ESP of +5.56% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to release results on Jul 27. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Gilead Sciences, Inc. GILD has an Earnings ESP of +3.32% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 26.
Intercept Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ICPT has an Earnings ESP of +9.39% and a Zacks Rank #3.  The company is expected to release results on Aug 3.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think. See This Ticker Free >>

Albany, NY -- (SBWIRE) -- 07/19/2017 --  The global market for protein kinase c beta (PKC-Beta) Inhibitors is increasing significantly. This increase in the market is majorly due to high efficacy of treatment for diabetes, cardiac disorder, cancer, and others has increased the scope for protein kinase c beta inhibitors. The advantage of long acting, specific and effective treatment of the diseases has increased the preference for protein kinase c beta inhibitors market.   

View Report @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/protein-kinase-c-beta-inhibitors-market.html

The protein kinase c beta molecules are serine/threonine protein kinases, that perform a significant function in numerous cellular functions such as gene expression, hormone secretion, and cell growth and differentiation. The protein kinase - C (PKC) molecules are integrated into several important signal transduction pathways stimulated by a wide range of growth factors like GPCRs. These PKC enzyme are calcium and lipid sensitive. The phospholipase C enzymes hydrolyze phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce membrane bound Di-acyl glycerol (DAG), which in turn activates inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and protein kinase c (PKC), which leads to mobilization of intracellular calcium. Protein kinase c (PKC) is expressed in most of the tissues and various protein kinase c (PKC) sub-families are expressed in the single cell.

The protein kinase c (PKC) beta inhibitors are available in two conventional isoforms, PKC-beta I and PKC-beta II with C1 domain. PKC?1 (PRKCB) situated on chromosome 16p11.2. It comprises 17 exons. The PKC?1 isoform is comparatively short amongst the two isoforms. It included two alternatively spliced mRNAs and it results from use of an alternating splice site at the 5'-end of the terminal exon. Both the PKC?1 and PKC?2 isoform has different C-terminus. It includes 671 amino acid proteins and is involved in B cell activation, endothelial cell proliferation, and endothelial cell proliferation. It also includes intestinal carbohydrate absorption, immediate stress. The protein kinase c PKC?2/ PRKCB are situated on chromosome 16p11.2 which is composed of 17 exons, 673 amino acid proteins and with two alternatively spliced mRNAs. The PKC?2 isoform is comparatively the longer isoform.

This is the most exciting time in the history of medicine. Millions of people around the world are benefiting from breakthrough treatments that save, extend and improve life.
Research, technology and genomics are coming together to create a platform that allows researchers to decipher the cause of disease as never before. Each advance opens new doors, new cures, new treatments.
And yet, it’s not enough.
"Today's breakthroughs become tomorrow's medicines." Tweet
Cures don’t appear on a schedule. In search of the unknowable, in search of curing the incurable, there is no one map, no singular template, no predictable milestones.
Finding lifesaving medicines is a life’s work – the work of thousands of researchers who never say never. It's also the work of millions of patients who fight side by side with researchers in the battle for life, against whatever odds they face together.
Now is the time to put the accelerator to the floor. The best is yet to come – like groundbreaking advances in immunotherapy and personalized medicine – where the once impossible is now reality.
Welcome to the future of medicine. Where disease is no match for tenacity. No match for ingenuity. Where together, we go boldly.
Dylan Thomas penned "Do not go gentle into that good night" in 1947, but the sentiment is as timely today as it ever was. Millions of Americans are battling serious illnesses, but they’re not alone in the fight. They have the support of thousands of biopharmaceutical researchers whose lives are dedicated to helping patients go boldly into longer, healthier, and more productive lives.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
