Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].

The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur.

BTG Pactual Enters Agreement to Purchase Ariel Re from Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited
07/10/2014HAMILTON, Bermuda, July 10, 2014 — Banco BTG Pactual S.A. (BTG Pactual) and Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited announced today that they have signed an agreement whereby BTG Pactual will acquire Ariel Re, Global Atlantic’s Bermuda-based property and casualty reinsurance company. The transaction, which includes all of the operating entities, assets and obligations of Ariel Re, is still subject to customary regulatory approvals. The purchase price has not been disclosed.
Ariel Re will be the cornerstone of BTG Pactual’s international reinsurance venture, which builds on the success of its London-based reinsurance principal investment business and establishes a permanent presence in the industry. Ariel Re, which has offices in Bermuda and London, will continue to operate its Lloyd’s of London syndicate and retain access to Lloyd's security ratings. The transaction will be seamless for brokers and customers.
“Ariel Re is an exceptional business with a strong track record, experienced people, market-leading technology and an innovative structure, including a Lloyd’s syndicate. While current market conditions are clearly challenging, the opportunity to buy a best-in-class business with proven risk-discipline was too good to miss, as it offers an exceptional opportunity to expand our presence in the P&C industry outside of our local market,” said Andre Esteves, CEO of BTG Pactual.
Ariel Re will continue to operate under the Ariel Re brand name and identity. This transaction will provide Ariel Re and its talented team of insurance and reinsurance professionals the opportunity to continue their record of growth and underwriting performance into the future.
Going forward, Global Atlantic will concentrate its strategic focus on growing its life and annuity business. With over $30 billion in assets, the company will continue to innovate and develop a compelling, diversified mix of insurance and reinsurance offerings tailored to the evolving needs of today’s consumers and institutional customers.
“As markets and our strategy have evolved over the past year, we determined that the best path forward for each of the company’s business units from a strategic perspective was to operate them separately,” said Allan Levine, CEO of Global Atlantic. “With this transaction, both the Property & Casualty and Life & Annuity businesses are well positioned for success with a more concentrated focus on their individual long-term strategies and objectives.”
About the companies
Global Atlantic is a multi-line insurance and reinsurance company with over $30 billion in assets. It was founded at Goldman Sachs in 2004 and separated as an independent company in April of 2013. Through its Forethought and Accordia Life subsidiaries, the company markets annuities and life insurance products throughout the United States. Its Commonwealth Re subsidiary provides international reinsurance solutions.
BTG Pactual is an innovative global financial firm operating as a meritocratic partnership with a passion for consistently creating value for its clients and shareholders. With 30 years of experience, BTG Pactual has more than 2,800 employees and offices throughout Latin America, the US, the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong. BTG Pactual currently has a market cap of US$14.0 billion, US$7.5 billion in equity, US$85.7 billion in total assets, US$83.3 billion AuM in its asset management unit and US$30.1 billion AuM in its wealth management

Committees
Fiscal Council
Under Brazilian Corporations Law, a company may form a fiscal council to operate as a corporate body independent of its management and its independent auditors. A fiscal council may be either permanent or non-permanent. A non-permanent fiscal council is formed at the request of shareholders that represent at least 10.0% of the voting shares or 5.0% of the non-voting shares. Such request may be made at any shareholders’ meeting. Banco BTG Pactual does not currently have a fiscal council and has, therefore, not elected any fiscal council members. When formed, the fiscal council will be non-permanent pursuant to our by-laws and composed of a minimum of three and a maximum of five members and their respective alternates, according to Brazilian Corporations Law.
The primary responsibilities of a fiscal council are monitoring management activities, reviewing the company’s financial statements and reporting its findings to the shareholders. Under Brazilian Corporations Law, Banco BTG Pactual would be required to pay fiscal council members, as compensation, a minimum of 10.0% of the average annual amount paid to Banco BTG Pactual’s executive officers.
Under Brazilian Corporations Law, the fiscal council may not include members that are (i) on the board of directors of Banco BTG Pactual, (ii) on the board of executive officers of Banco BTG Pactual, (iii) employed by Banco BTG Pactual, (iv) employed by a subsidiary or company under common control with Banco BTG Pactual or (v) spouses or close family members of any member of the board of directors or board of executive officers of Banco BTG Pactual.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

The AMF claims that Charles Rosier, a banker, tipped Raad off about an impending transaction that involved French state railway SNCF bidding for Geodis, and that Raad bought Geodis shares and options worth €8m in the fortnight leading up to the announcement of the bid.

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries.

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

BTG Pactual is a Brazilian financial company that operates in the markets of Investment Banking, Wealth Management and Asset Management. It offers advisory services in mergers and acquisitions, wealth planning, loans and financings, as well as investment solutions and market analyses.
With headquarters in São Paulo, the clients of the Bank – which started out as a brokerage firm in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro – are companies, retail and institutional investors, as well as municipal, state and federal governments. With assets of R$218,3 bn and shares traded on the BM&F Bovespa and NYSE Euronext, BTG Pactual has offices in the main Latin American cities and in the world's leading financial centers.[citation needed].
Since December 3, 2015, BTG Pactual is controlled by the Top Seven Partners, composed of members Marcelo Kalim, Roberto Sallouti, Persio Arida, Antonio Carlos Canto Porto Filho, James Marcos de Oliveira, Renato Monteiro dos Santos and Guilherme da Costa Paes. The group has acted as bank executives during André dos Santos Esteves' management, a former BTG Pactual controller and CEO.
The change came after the arrest of Esteves, who is still a shareholder of the bank, but without voting power. Esteves was arrested on November 25 in the Lava-jato operation, promoted by the Brazilian Federal Police. Since then, Roberto Sallouti and Marcelo Kalim are co-CEOs of the bank. Persio Arida is chairman of the Board of Directors.
Since then, the executives promoted different measures to disassociate the image of BTG Pactual of its former CEO, especially after the reaction of the capital market (the bank's units on BM&FBOVESPA depreciated more than 50% within two weeks after Esteves arrest and continue to depreciate) and the lowering of the rating agencies Moody's and Fitch.

Controversies[edit]
Insider Trading[edit]
In November 2007, André Esteves' insider trading "force[d] the bank to amend its prospectus, give investors the option of reconsidering bids for BTG shares, and put a cloud over one of this year's highest profile bank deals."[1] In "a statement, BTG Pactual said Esteves believed the allegations had no merit and was determined to appeal the decision."[2] However, the CEO of BTG Pactual André Esteves, did not file an appeal, citing cost and a loss of time as his reasons.[3]
In 2013, Charles Rosier, a partner of BTG Pactual,[4] was convicted in the largest insider trading case in the history of France.[5][6][7] While at UBS, at the end of March and early April 2008, he and his cousin Joseph Raad used inside information to purchase shares and options in Geodis just before the announcement of a takeover bid. Of significance, Rosier worked at UBS when he participated in the insider trades when André Esteves, now CEO and partner and director of BTG Pactual, was still employed by UBS as head of fixed income in charge of $1.7 trillion USD.[8] Esteves had also committed inside trades while at UBS only a few months earlier in November 2007.[9] Also of significance, Huw Jenkins, partner and director and chairman of BTG Pactual and formerly CEO of UBS Investment Bank, was a consultant to UBS at the same time.[10]
Pactual sale to UBS and resale to BTG[edit]
Arthur Rutishauser in Sonntagszeitung argued that the way 27% of BTG was acquired is an example of an insider case: André Esteves sold the bank in 2006 for 3.1 billion Swiss Francs to UBS, where at that time Huw Jenkins was a key decision maker, and heavily involved in that transaction.[11] Esteves later repurchased Pactual back in 2009 for 2.5 billion Swiss Francs after being allowed to leave UBS to set up BTG.[11] Huw Jenkins was ejected from UBS in 2007 and disappeared from view, to then resurface as a senior partner and Board member at BTG Pactual in 2010.[12]
BTG Pactual Purchase of BSI[edit]
On 14 July 2014, BTG Pactual purchased Banca della Svizzera Italiana (BSI), with the purchase being subject to the approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).[13] The current CEO of FINMA is Mark Branson who was previously the CEO of UBS Securities Japan Ltd.[14] Of significance, Branson reported directly to Huw Jenkins, the CEO of UBS Investment Bank and who is now a partner and director of BTG Pactual.[15][16] Branson also worked alongside André Esteves, now CEO of BTG Pactual while both worked at UBS in its management committee in November 2007 during which time Andre Esteves committed insider trades.[17] Under Mark Branson’s leadership, FINMA is in the process to now decide whether to approve BTG Pactual’s purchase of BSI, despite BTG Pactual being owned and operated by his former boss and colleague Huw Jenkins and André Esteves, although it clearly does not implicate any illegal activity whatsoever.[16]
Fraudulent misrepresentation claim by BGT Pactual Asia Ltd employee[edit]
An ex-employee of Hong Kong subsidiary BGT Pactual Asia Ltd, Zeljko Ivic, filed a claim in late 2013 alleging Banco BTG Pactual SA board member Huw Jenkins and CEO André Esteves made fraudulent misrepresentations to Zeljko Ivic to induce him to sign agreements with Banco BTG Pactual SA.[18][19] Ivic claimed he had played a key role in Banco BTG Pactual SA's IPO, raising funds from nine entities, including the China Investment Corporation, GIC Private Limited, as well as the Agnelli and Rothschild families, for which services Jenkins had promised him a partnership and shares.[20][21] Ivic valued his claim at some US$20 million. He started proceedings after being dismissed in October 2013.[22][23][24] Jenkins was reported to have been served a writ in the case during a Hong Kong visit.[25]
Conflict with Brazilian Regulators and Central Bank[edit]
Bloomberg L.P. reported that “In three separate cases since 1999, Brazil’s central bank and securities commission alleged Pactual had illegally transferred profits to foreign funds to disguise gains and avoid taxes.”[26] In the last case, Pactual was ordered to pay 4 million reais, in addition to the fines charged to the bank partners themselves.[26]
Involvement in Sete[edit]
On 19 June 2015, Marcelo Odebrecht, the CEO of Brazil’s largest construction company was arrested by Brazilian Federal Police. Odebrecht was arrested on allegations of fraud, corruption, money laundering and organized crime relating to contracts worth billions of dollars with the rigs company Sete and the state oil company Petrobras. While in detention, Odebrecht attempted to pass a handwritten note to his lawyers that included and mentioned André Esteves, thus potentially implicating BTG Pactual and Andre Esteves in Lava Jato (Carwash). One of Sete’s largest shareholders is BTG Pactual headed by CEO André Esteves. In the handwritten note, Odebrecht requested his lawyers to “destroy rigs’ email.”[27][28][29] On 25 November 2015, Esteves was arrested as part of a criminal investigation into Petrobras after he was investigated for his bank's dealings with the oil company.[30]

Der grösste Insiderfall – allerdings kein strafbarer, sondern ein cleverer – ist, wie Esteves zu seiner Bank kam, an der er 27 Prozent be sitzt und die er beherrscht. Er verkaufte die Bank 2006 der UBS für 3,1 Milliarden Franken. Zwei Jahre später kaufte er sie für 2,5 Milliarden zurück und brachte sie 2012 für 14 Milliar den Dollar an die Börse. Verantwortlich für den Kauf der Pactual war 2006 der damaligen UBS-Investmentbanking chef Hew Jenkins. Jenkins wur de da mals kurzzeitig zum Chef von Esteves. Es war unter seiner Ägide, als die UBS einen grossen Teil der Schrott-Hypotheken kaufte, die bei der UBS zu den 60 Milliarden Franken Abschreibungen und letztlich zum Eingreifen des Staates führten.

Les 2000 employés de BSI pouvaient regarder de l’avant, Generali tourner la page, BTG Pactual se féliciter d’avoir payé un montant jugé dérisoire par nombre d’observateurs – 1,5 milliard de francs pour 89 milliards sous gestion – et la Suisse se réjouir d’attirer encore des banques étrangères. Presque un an plus tard, le rachat doit toujours être validé par la Finma. Si le délai peut sembler long, c’est que le feu vert de l’autorité de surveillance des marchés financiers est lié, en partie, au dossier fiscal américain. Or, BSI a conclu un accord à 211 millions de dollars avec la justice américaine (DoJ) fin mars. Ce qui devrait lui permettre, espère-t-elle dans son rapport annuel publié dans la foulée, d’entériner la transaction rapidement. «La clôture du dossier américain était l’une des préconditions au rachat de BTG», souligne ainsi une source proche du dossier.

André Esteves, o bilionário fundador do BTG Pactual do Brasil, foi processado por um ex-funcionário em Hong Kong, que alega que lhe foram prometidas uma parceria e ações por conseguir investidores antes da venda inicial de ações do banco. Zeljko Ivic alegou que o Banco BTG Pactual SA, o presidente e CEO Esteves e Huw Jenkins, um sócio-gerente, fizeram deturpações fraudulentas para que ele assinasse acordos com o banco de investimentos, conforme uma ação judicial apresentada perante o Supremo Tribunal de Hong Kong.

Andre Esteves, the billionaire founder of Brazil’s BTG Pactual, was sued by a former employee in Hong Kong who claims he was promised a partnership and stock for securing investors before the bank’s initial share sale. Zeljko Ivic alleged that Banco BTG Pactual SA, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Esteves and Huw Jenkins, a managing partner, made fraudulent misrepresentations to get him to sign agreements with the investment bank, according to a lawsuit filed with the Hong Kong High Court. BTG Pactual raised as much as 3.66 billion reais ($1.66 billion) in its 2012 initial public offering. The sale followed a 2010 agreement to sell a stake to a group including China Investment Corp., GIC Pte. and the Rothschild and Agnelli families. Esteves, 45, is worth $4.2 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, mostly due to his 22 percent stake in BTG Pactual. Jenkins and Hong Kong-based BTG Pactual Asia Ltd., which has also been sued, will vigorously defend the claims, “which they believe to be baseless and without merit,” according to their lawyer Randall Arthur. BTG Pactual doesn’t comment on matters under litigation, the Sao Paulo-based bank said in an e-mail response to queries. Shares of the company fell 0.7 percent to 32.22 reais at 10:41 a.m. in Sao Paulo. Ivic is seeking more than $20 million as damages for the value of the shares and partnership promised, as well as unpaid bonuses, his lawyer Robert Tibbo said.
