Reviewer: lita from NJ
Overall: Rated: 3 stars!
Comfort: Rated:3 stars!
Style: Rated:3 stars!


I purchased this swimsuit in a large. I don't know if it is the fact that I'm a 38DD that made that slit in the front a wider opening that extended to my belly button, but that isn't what I wanted. However if I purchased a larger size it would have looked like I was wearing a sagging black bag around my mid section.

As a 5'10" woman, it's difficult to find one piece suits that are long enough for my torso. This one is the best I've found, although I do wish it was even a tiny bit longer as it pinches my shoulders a tad, but I can't complain! Really stylish and I got a ton of compliments

Could have been a cute bathing suit top...I think I could have used a bigger size in the cup size and that might have made it fit better. Unfortunately, I will be returning because I think the sizes were limited when i ordered.

I completely agree with the other reviewer. Despite how cute these are (and I LOVE the halter bikini top), this suit is going back. That band is just entirely too much fabric. Extremely unflattering.

Reviewer: Melissa from Michigan

Comfort: Rated:2 stars!

A little TOO supportive! The combination of the underwire, clasps, and straps made The Girls look like I was wearing a corset. Plus non-removable padding! Being larger on top, I look for support, but this overshot. 3 style stars for cute fabric. Returned.

These bikini bottoms are excellent. I'm 5'3 and 145lbs and a large fit great. These bottoms come up high enough to cover my pregnancy scars and are still fashionable for my young age of 36 years. You can definitely mix and match these bottoms.

I loved the front of this suit, very flattering and modern. The back of the suit has way to much going on... I wish they had left of the back tie as it is totally unnecessary and adds bulk.

This could be good one piece swim wear if you are a tall and lean. For inverted body type is not good, too loose on top and not so appealing.

I really liked the look of the bathing suit. It had a marled look to the fabric and the style helped to hide my post pregnancy belly. However, the cups and the underwire on the hidden top portion was very small...probably an A or B cup...I am currently a double D with all the milk I'm producing. I would totally like the suit if it weren't for the cups being so small!

I wanted to love this but the fabric band that goes across the front didn't lie flat and looked like a little puffy tube around my hips. Maybe it would have improved after swimming in it or washing it, but I decided to return it.

Baja Geo Chantelle Underwire Tankini

Reviewer: Anonymous from Virginia
Overall: Rated: 5 stars!
Comfort: Rated:5 stars!
Style: Rated:5 stars!


This is a really nice tankini top. Great coverage without feeling too matronly. Has a bit of a retro feel to it. The fabric is nice and soft and holds you in well. The wide straps are comfy and a nice change of pace from really thin straps that don't feel substantial enough to actually hold anything up. The length is great too, hits at hip (I'm 5'10"). The pattern helps hide my belly, which is always nice. I'm usually a 38C bra size, but the cups in this are pretty roomy, so I had to go down to a 36B/C. I haven't gone swimming in it yet, but it will definitely look nice for lounging on the beach and chasing a toddler around w/out worrying about falling out of my suit. As an aside, the top I got wasn't sewn properly - it bunched under one of the arms - so I am exchanging for another and hoping it will work out.

Cabana Solids Alexandra Underwire One-Piece
Posted: 7/17/17
Reviewer: lita from NJ
Overall: Rated: 3 stars!
Comfort: Rated:3 stars!
Style: Rated:3 stars!


I purchased this swimsuit in a large. I don't know if it is the fact that I'm a 38DD that made that slit in the front a wider opening that extended to my belly button, but that isn't what I wanted. However if I purchased a larger size it would have looked like I was wearing a sagging black bag around my mid section.

As a 5'10" woman, it's difficult to find one piece suits that are long enough for my torso. This one is the best I've found, although I do wish it was even a tiny bit longer as it pinches my shoulders a tad, but I can't complain! Really stylish and I got a ton of compliments

Could have been a cute bathing suit top...I think I could have used a bigger size in the cup size and that might have made it fit better. Unfortunately, I will be returning because I think the sizes were limited when i ordered.

I completely agree with the other reviewer. Despite how cute these are (and I LOVE the halter bikini top), this suit is going back. That band is just entirely too much fabric. Extremely unflattering.

Reviewer: Melissa from Michigan

A little TOO supportive! The combination of the underwire, clasps, and straps made The Girls look like I was wearing a corset. Plus non-removable padding! Being larger on top, I look for support, but this overshot. 3 style stars for cute fabric. Returned.

These bikini bottoms are excellent. I'm 5'3 and 145lbs and a large fit great. These bottoms come up high enough to cover my pregnancy scars and are still fashionable for my young age of 36 years. You can definitely mix and match these bottoms.

I loved the front of this suit, very flattering and modern. The back of the suit has way to much going on... I wish they had left of the back tie as it is totally unnecessary and adds bulk.

This could be good one piece swim wear if you are a tall and lean. For inverted body type is not good, too loose on top and not so appealing.

I really liked the look of the bathing suit. It had a marled look to the fabric and the style helped to hide my post pregnancy belly. However, the cups and the underwire on the hidden top portion was very small...probably an A or B cup...I am currently a double D with all the milk I'm producing. I would totally like the suit if it weren't for the cups being so small!

I wanted to love this but the fabric band that goes across the front didn't lie flat and looked like a little puffy tube around my hips. Maybe it would have improved after swimming in it or washing it, but I decided to return it.
