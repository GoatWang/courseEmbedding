The sales and distribution network has grown from a regional company to a major international agribusiness and highway infrastructure firm with worldwide annual revenues of $551.3 million in fiscal 2012. Lindsay is a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (LNN) and is ISO9001:2008 certified.

About Lindsay

Lindsay has irrigation systems operating in more than 90 countries. As a Nebraska-based company, Lindsay is strong and dependable – much like the small town roots that the company originated from. Tough, dependable Zimmatic by Lindsay irrigation systems have been the choice of the world’s irrigators for over 50 years. The company’s success comes from finding a better way to irrigate almost any crop on varied terrain and soils to increase yields and better utilize natural resources.
About Lindsay

Lindsay’s infrastructure segments are driven by the world’s population growth, particularly in emerging nations. These divisions are working with agencies to make roadways and railways safer during expansion and renovation.

Since 1985 when Barrier Systems (BSI) first introduced the Quickchange Moveable Barrier (QMB), road authorities around the world have been taking advantage of this low cost solution for adding lanes for rush hour traffic to reduce congestion improve safety and increase traffic throughout Now BSI has used their knowledge and expertise to expand product lines to include a multitude of roadway safety products. Today, a wide variety of road safety products have made Barrier Systems a leader in the roadway safety industry.

Recent acquisitions have expanded Lindsay’s capabilities in offering various industrial solutions. Digitec, acquired by Lindsay in 2010 is an electronics research, development and manufacturing company. One of their key products is WaveRoute Enterprise is a hosted web based M2M application for managing, monitoring and controlling these devices and sensors remotely.

IRZ Consulting, acquired in 2011, is an irrigation consulting and design firm known for its work with large growers to design water delivery systems for agriculture and for providing services for yield-enhancement and cost reduction. These value-adding services include soil moisture monitoring and energy usage monitoring and reduction processes, among others. The addition of IRZ allows Lindsay irrigation to offer turn-key systems.

Acquired by Lindsay in 2011, ez-Wireless provides wireless communications solutions to power advanced applications such as sensor networks, video surveillance, telemetry and other Plug-and-Play Add-on services using integrated conventional radio and wireless broadband solutions.

WOW! This is amazing! I cannot believe how super simple it is to research and create a family tree with very little information in hand. This is simply above and beyond anything else I've seen on the web! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
R. Sloan, Gallatin, Tennessee, USA


I have been trying to piece together my family for over 35 years and Smart Matches made it go past my wildest dreams. Thanks to MyHeritage, this is a wonderful and really exciting hobby to really dig deep into.
D. Henry, North Lauderdale, Florida, USA


MyHeritage is a great place to develop a family tree. In less than two weeks time I was able to track my family back to 1877. This is in no small part due to the vast storehouse of data that is available through MyHeritage.
W. Vacca, Bonita Springs, Florida, USA


I am having the time of my life. Thanks for offering such a fabulous site that is going to help so many!
K. N. Mathias , South Fulton, Tennessee, USA


Thanks to your site I finally was able to unlock the mystery! It has been a great revelation to find so many family members after so many years.
