Overseas shareholders The release, publication or distribution of this announcement in jurisdictions other than the United Kingdom may be restricted by, or otherwise subject to, the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, and therefore persons into whose possession this announcement comes should inform themselves about and observe any such laws or regulations.

It is the responsibility of each such person to satisfy himself as to the full observance of the laws and regulations of each relevant jurisdiction, including the obtaining of any governmental or other consents which may be required to be observed and the payment of any taxes or fees in such jurisdictions. This announcement has been prepared for the purpose of complying with English law and the Code and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if this announcement had been prepared in accordance with the laws and regulations of any jurisdiction outside the United Kingdom. Unless otherwise determined by ACE or required by the Code and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Offer will not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into, or by use of the mails, or by any means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, by means of telephone, facsimile, internet or other forms of electronic communication) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facilities of a securities exchange of, any Restricted Jurisdiction, and the Offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facility or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction. Accordingly, unless otherwise determined by ACE or required by the Code and permitted by applicable law and regulation, copies of this announcement and any other related document are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise distributed or sent in or into any Restricted Jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not distribute or send them in, into or from such jurisdictions as doing so may make invalid any purported acceptance of the Offer by persons in any such Restricted Jurisdiction.The availability of the Offer to persons not resident in the UK may be affected by the laws of jurisdictions other than the UK. Persons who are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the UK should obtain professional advice and observe any applicable requirements.Notice to ARMS Shareholders in the United StatesThe Offer is being made for securities of a company organised under the laws of England, and ARMS Shareholders in the United States should be aware that this document and any other documents relating to the Offer have been prepared in accordance with the Code, the applicable rules and regulations of the Financial Conduct Authority and UK disclosure requirements, format and style, all of which differ from laws, regulations and rules generally applicable in the United States. The financial statements incorporated by reference in this document have been prepared otherwise than in accordance with US GAAP and may not be comparable to the financial statements or other financial information of US companies. The Offer is being made in respect of the securities of a non-US company which does not have securities registered under Section 12 of the US Securities Exchange Act. The Offer is being made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) of, and Regulation 14E under, the US Securities Exchange Act, subject to the exemptions provided by Rule 14d-1 under the US Securities Exchange Act and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of the Code. Accordingly, the Offer is subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements, including with respect to withdrawal rights, offer timetable, settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under US domestic tender offer procedures and laws. In the United States, the Offer is made solely by ACE and not by any of its financial advisers. In accordance with, and to the extent permitted by, the Code, normal UK market practice and Rule 14e-5 under the US Securities Exchange Act, ACE or its nominees, or its brokers (acting as agents) or their respective affiliates may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase of, ARMS Shares outside the United States, other than pursuant to the Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. Such purchases, or arrangements to purchase, will comply with all applicable UK rules, including the Code and the rules of the London Stock Exchange, and Rule 14e-5 under the US Securities Exchange Act to the extent applicable.  Each ARMS Shareholder in the United States is urged to consult with his independent professional adviser regarding any acceptance of the Offer including, without limitation, to consider the tax consequences associated with such shareholder's acceptance of the Offer. Neither the US Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other United States state securities commission has approved or disapproved the Offer, or passed judgment upon the adequacy or completeness of this document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence.It may be difficult for ARMS Shareholders in the United States to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the US federal or state securities laws, since ACE and ARMS are incorporated under the laws of countries other than the United States, and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. ARMS Shareholders in the United States may not be able to sue a non-US company or its officers or directors in a non-US court for violations of the US securities laws. Further, it may be difficult to compel a non-US company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a US court's judgment or jurisdiction.Publication on websiteThis announcement will be available on ACE's website at www.asiacoalenergyventures.com. by no later than 12 noon on 16 July 2015. (1)Registered in the name of Borneo Bumi Energi & Metal Pte Ltd(2) In calculating the 90% threshold, ACE is entitled to ignore the 2,347,930 shares issued pursuant to the ARMS Share Incentive Schemes under s. 979(5)(a) as they were allotted after the date of the Offer (although they are included in the shares to which the Offer relates).  The shares to which the Offer relates are therefore (243,304,997 - 2,347,930 - 11,192,495 =) 229,764,572 and 90% threshold is 206,788,115 shares.This information is provided by RNSThe company news service from the London Stock Exchange   END  MSCGUGDRGDBBGUL
