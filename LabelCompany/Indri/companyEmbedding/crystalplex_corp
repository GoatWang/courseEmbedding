Technological Developments
Development of a Highly Stable and Thermally Processable Sapphire™ Quantum Dot Polymer Matrix Using a Two-Prong Approach.  Click on the thumbnail to read more.












Crystalplex is a nanotechnology company with the world's first and only alloy gradient quantum dots (QDs) for the optoelectronics industry.  The proprietary technology in our SapphireTM QDs provides a stable crystal design, flexible polymer matrix morphology, and meets environmentally responsible yet demanding performance requirements for high-end consumer electronics applications such as LCD TVs, displays, and high-CRI architectural lighting.











Alloy gradient core for all quantum dots

Our SapphireTM quantum dots are unique because all are of similar size and shape regardless of color output
The composition of the alloy gradient core determines color

Provides a proprietary sapphire (AI2O3) outer passivation shell
Consistent crystal structure permits application of sapphire shell
Isolates QD from degrading effects of oxygen and humidity






Custom polymer QD composites for downstream processing as an ink or a thermoplastic

Chemical bonds hold the QDs in a matrix dispersion
Transparent polymer can be film cast, extruded, or injection molded

Next generation cadmium-free quantum dots

Alloy gradient QDs with SapphireTM stability package
Contact Crystalplex for more information

Patent Granted by USPTO for Crystalplex Corp.'s Sapphire™ Quantum Dots

PITTSBURGH, September28, 2016- Crystalplex Corp. today announced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U. S. Patent No. 9,425,253, "Passivated Nanoparticles," assigned to Crystalplex. The patent, which claims the fabrication and use of Sapphire™ quantum dots, or passivated quantum dots with improved stability, was granted to inventors Lianhua Qu and Gregory Miller.

The patent is directed to processes for synthesizing an alloy gradient nanoparticle with a Zn:S shell and an outside coating of aluminum oxide that provides a barrier to environmental degradation. In addition to providing improved photo, thermal, and environmental stability, the quantum dots demonstrate longer lifetimes, as the optically transparent aluminum oxide outer layer serves as a shield against degradation by humidity and oxygen. The passivation technology is applicable to Crystalplex's alloy gradient cadmium-free quantum dots, as well.

"The protection provided by the Sapphire ™ quantum dot shell makes passivated nanoparticles particularly well suited to the demanding requirements of optoelectronic applications," said Dr. Qu, Chief Technical Officer at Crystalplex Corp. "They have proven to be quite resilient." In August, Dr. Qu presented his findings on the use of passivated quantum dots in a thermally processable matrix at the 26th International Liquid Crystal Conference (ILCC) at Kent State University in Ohio. (See Dr. Qu's technical paper www.crystalplex.com and click on Technological Developments)

"The granting of the passivation patent further strengthens our robust patent portfolio," said Crysta Ip lex CEO Matt Boatman. In addition, these air-stable quantum dots have been melt processed in polymer substrates. To our knowledge no other manufacturer's quantum dots can withstand such extreme heat." (See video of quantum dot/polymer composite being co-extruded with PMMA at over 200°C: at crystalplex.com/#LiveContent[quantumdots])

Crystalplex Corp. is a private firm with 12 years of R&D directed to quantum dot technology. The company maintains a fully integrated synthesis and pilot application plant in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

SapphireTM Quantum Dots: Alloyed Nanocrystal Technology








	Unlike
standard Quantum Dots, our 
	SapphireTM quantum dot colors are tuned by composition
rather than size. Our quantum dots are equivalent in size (8-10 nm) and mass
regardless of emission color. All colors are equally bright and have
comparable quantum efficiency throughout the visible spectrum. Our Quantum Dots
are inherently stable as single semiconductor nanocrystals.





For Optoelectronic use only.

Patent Granted by USPTO for Crystalplex Corp.'s Sapphire™ Quantum Dots

PITTSBURGH, September28, 2016- Crystalplex Corp. today announced the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued U. S. Patent No. 9,425,253, "Passivated Nanoparticles," assigned to Crystalplex. The patent, which claims the fabrication and use of Sapphire™ quantum dots, or passivated quantum dots with improved stability, was granted to inventors Lianhua Qu and Gregory Miller.

The patent is directed to processes for synthesizing an alloy gradient nanoparticle with a Zn:S shell and an outside coating of aluminum oxide that provides a barrier to environmental degradation. In addition to providing improved photo, thermal, and environmental stability, the quantum dots demonstrate longer lifetimes, as the optically transparent aluminum oxide outer layer serves as a shield against degradation by humidity and oxygen. The passivation technology is applicable to Crystalplex's alloy gradient cadmium-free quantum dots, as well.

"The protection provided by the Sapphire ™ quantum dot shell makes passivated nanoparticles particularly well suited to the demanding requirements of optoelectronic applications," said Dr. Qu, Chief Technical Officer at Crystalplex Corp. "They have proven to be quite resilient." In August, Dr. Qu presented his findings on the use of passivated quantum dots in a thermally processable matrix at the 26th International Liquid Crystal Conference (ILCC) at Kent State University in Ohio. (See Dr. Qu's technical paper www.crystalplex.com and click on Technological Developments)

"The granting of the passivation patent further strengthens our robust patent portfolio," said Crysta Ip lex CEO Matt Boatman. In addition, these air-stable quantum dots have been melt processed in polymer substrates. To our knowledge no other manufacturer's quantum dots can withstand such extreme heat." (See video of quantum dot/polymer composite being co-extruded with PMMA at over 200°C: at crystalplex.com/#LiveContent[quantumdots])

Crystalplex Corp. is a private firm with 12 years of R&D directed to quantum dot technology. The company maintains a fully integrated synthesis and pilot application plant in Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
