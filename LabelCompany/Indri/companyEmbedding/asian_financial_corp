                Introduction To Asian Financial Markets            


    By Lisa Smith

In a global economy, there are plenty of opportunities to invest outside of North America and Europe. Asia, in particular, offers a host of opportunities. Also, it is home to robust financial markets representing trillions of dollars. Any market that large is bound to offer some interesting investment opportunities. (Emerging markets like India are fast becoming engines for future growth. Find out how to get in on the ground floor. Check out The Indian Stock Market 101.)TUTORIAL: The Forex Market
The regions of Asia are divided into developed and developing economies. The highly developed countries include Japan and the four countries often referred to as the Asian Tigers - Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Major players among the other powerhouses include Russia, China, India and Malaysia. These other nations are major economic forces, but academics often debate whether or not they can be classified as "developed". Malaysia, for example, is a major source of scientific innovations, yet fails to be fully recognized as a developed nation.
Asia's DevelopmentHistorically, while the Asian markets have had stock exchanges for more than 100 years, they did not rise to prominence until after World War II. Japan set the pace with protectionist policies, and a strong central-government-led development effort that turned the country into an exporting powerhouse.
In time, its neighbors soon took notice of the trend. A host of other nations, including Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, India and China, began a period of rapid industrialization in the early 1960s that continued through the 21st Century. These nations entered the global marketplace by exporting mass-produced products and then, over time, many of them evolved their efforts to enter the high-tech arena. With the injection of large amounts of foreign investment capital, the Asian Tiger economies grew substantially between the late 1980s and early- to mid-1990s.
Cross-industry growth continued until 1997 when Asia was struck with the financial crisis. The main cause of the Asian financial crisis was the collapse of the Thai baht which was ineffectively pegged to the U.S. dollar, as Thailand accumulated an excessive debt burden. Although many other regions such as China were less affected, Asia's economic growth experienced major setbacks. Since the late 1990s, these economies have recovered.
Korea is a prime example of a country that emerged from the turmoil to become a dominant player in international markets, as the country has become a technology powerhouse. With a high emphasis on education, South Korea is one of the world leaders in the robotics, biotechnology and aerospace research fields. China and India are following suite, as they work their way through the same development process. (Brazil is well positioned for future growth, and luckily for investors, it also has a very liberal investing climate. To learn more, see Investing In Brazil 101.)
Opportunity: How Investors Can Get InThe development of Asia and the cross-border flow of capital globally present a host of opportunities for investors. For investors who prefer to delegate research and trading responsibilities to professional money managers, there are numerous mutual funds and Asia-specific exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available. These funds run the gamut from regional to country specific, index trackers to sector-specific stock selectors and offer an inexpensive and easy way to benefit from diversification and professional management.
For those who prefer the do-it-yourself method, American Depository Receipts (ADRs) provided an excellent way to buy shares in a foreign company while realizing any dividends and capital gains in U.S. dollars. ADRs are negotiable certificates issued by a U.S. bank representing a specified number of shares (or one share) in a foreign stock that is traded on a U.S. exchange. For example, foreign firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange as ADRs give investors the opportunity to put their money into such internationally known brands as Honda (NYSE:HMC), Hitachi (NYSE:HIT), Mitsubishi (NYSE:MTU) and Sony (NYSE:SNE).
Different than Western Developed MarketsAsian financial markets, particularly within developing economies, are still generally less mature and less regulated than markets in America or Europe. Bond markets, in particular, are often underdeveloped, as bank financing is much more common than financing via the issuance of corporate debt. On the equity side, Asian markets are less likely to do the same type of capital restructuring that is common in America, with leveraged buyouts and similar maneuvers being exceptions rather than the rule. The wide variety of financial products available through retail banks is also more common in developed countries outside Asia.
Regulatory reforms in Asian financial markets also lag Western markets, and political factors can play a role, particularly in less developed economies where government intervention can be heavy. The operating differences and regulatory differences all serve as reminders of the need for investors to conduct research and give careful consideration to any investment before adding it to their portfolios.
Asian Flavor for Your Portfolio At the end of 2010, the Asian economies were still booming. China, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia are exporting powerhouses. Gross domestic product is rising in these nations and so are the investment opportunities. Double-digit stock market returns have left Western markets in the dust over the past decade, and investors are taking notice.
Investing is Asia provide access to a significant portion of the world's stock markets in a fast-growing, exciting region. Putting a portion of your portfolio in Asia can help fill your portfolio's allocation to international investments.

The Asian Financial Crisis



The Asian Financial Crisis
Charles W.L.Hill
University of Washington
 
Asian Contagion
Between June 1997 and January 1998 a financial crisis swept
like a brush fire through the "tiger economies" of SE Asian. Over the previous
decade the SE Asian states of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
Hong Kong, and South Korea, had registered some of the most impressive
economic growth rates in the world. Their economies had expanded by 6%
to 9% per annum compounded, as measured by Gross Domestic Product. This
Asian miracle, however, appeared to come to an abrupt end in late 1997
when in one country after another, local stock markets and currency markets
imploded. When the dust started to settle in January 1998 the stock markets
in many of these states had lost over 70% of their value, their currencies
had depreciated against the US dollar by a similar amount, and the once
proud leaders of these nations had been forced to go cap in hand to the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to beg for a massive financial assistance.
This section explains why this happen, and explores the possible consequences,
both for the world economy, and for international businesses?
Background
The seeds of the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis were sown during
the previous decade when these countries were experiencing unprecedented
economic growth. Although there were and remain important differences between
the individual countries, a number of elements
were common too most. Exports had long been the engine of economic
growth in these countries. A combination of inexpensive and relatively
well educated labor, export oriented economies, falling barriers to international
trade, and in some cases such as Malaysia, heavy inward investment by foreign
companies, had combined during the previous quarter of a century to transform
many Asian states into export powerhouses.
Over the 1990-1996 period, for example, the value of exports from Malaysia
had grown by 18% per year, Thai exports had grown by 16% per year, Singapore�s
by 15% per year, Hong Kong�s by 14% per year, and those of South Korea
and Indonesia by 12% per year. The nature of these
exports had also shifted in recent years from basic materials and products
such as textiles to complex and increasingly high technology products,
such as automobiles, semi-conductors, and consumer electronics.
An Investment Boom. The wealth
created by export led growth helped to fuel an investment boom in commercial
and residential property, industrial assets, and infra-structure.
The value of commercial and residential real estate
in cities such as Hong Kong and Bangkok started to soar. In turn, this
fed a building boom the likes of which had never been seen before in Asia.
Office and apartment building were going up all over the region. Heavy
borrowing from banks financed much of this construction, but so long as
the value of property continued to rise, the banks were more than happy
to lend. As for industrial assets,
the continued success of Asian exporters encouraged them to make ever bolder
investments in industrial capacity. This was exemplified most clearly by
South Korea�s giant diversified conglomerates, or chaebol, many
of which had ambitions to build up a major position in the global automobile
and semi-conductor industries.


An added factor behind the investment boom in most SE Asian
economies was the government. In many
cases the government had embarked upon huge infra-structure projects. In
Malaysia, for example, a new government administrative center was been
constructed in Putrajaya for M$20 billion (US$8 billion at the pre July
1997 exchange rate), the government was funding the development of a massive
high technology communications corridor, and the huge Bakun dam, which
at a cost of M$13.6 billion was to be the most expensive power generation
scheme in the country.
Throughout the region governments also encouraged private businesses
to invest in certain sectors of the economy in accordance with "national
goals" and "industrialization strategy". In South Korea, long a country
where the government played a pro-active role in private sector investments,
President Kim Young-Sam urged the chaebol to invest in new factories.
Mr. Kim, a populist politician, took office in 1993 during a mild recession,
and promised to boost economic growth by encouraging investment in export
oriented industries. Korea did enjoyed an investment led economic boom
in the 1994-95 period, but at a cost. The chaebol,
always reliant on heavy borrowings, built up massive debts that were equivalent,
on average, to four times their equity.
In Malaysia, the government had encouraged strategic investments in
the semi-conductor and automobile industries, "in accordance with the Korean
model". One result of this was the national automobile manufacturer, Perusahaan
Otomobil Nasional Bhd, which was established in 1984. Protected by a 200%
import tariff and with few other competitors, the Proton, as the car was
dubbed, sold well in its captive market. By 1989 Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional
Bhd was selling 72,000 cars out of a total market of 117,000. By 1995 it
had a 62% share of a market which had grown to 225,000 cars annually. Whether
this company could succeed in a competitive marketplace, however, was another
question. Skeptical analysis note that in 1987 an average 1,600cc Proton
cost about three times per capita income in Malaysia; by 1996 a 1,6000cc
Proton costs 5.5 times per capita income � hardly what one would expect
from an efficient enterprise.
In Indonesia, President Suharato has long supported investments in a
network of an estimated 300 businesses that are owned by his family and
friends in a system known as "crony capitalism". Many of these businesses
have been granted lucrative monopolies by the President. For example, in
1990 one the President�s youngest son, Mr Hutomo, was granted a monopoly
on the sale of cloves, which are mixed with tobacco in the cigarettes preferred
by 9 out of 10 smokers in Indonesia. In another example, in 1995 Suharato
announced that he had decided to build a national car, and that the car
would be built by a company owned by Mr Hutomo, in association with Kia
motors of South Korea. To support the venture, a consortium of Indonesian
banks was "ordered" by the Government to offer almost $700 million in start-up
loans to the company.
In sum, by the mid 1990s SE Asia was in the grips of an unprecedented
investment boom, much of it financed with borrowed money. Between
1990 and 1995 gross domestic investment grew by 16.3% per annum in Indonesia,
16% per annum in Malaysia, 15.3% in Thailand, and 7.2% per annum in South
Korea. By comparison, investment grew by 4.1% per annum over the same period
in the US, and 0.8% per annum in all high income economies. Moreover, the
rate of investment accelerated in 1996. In Malaysia, for example, spending
on investment accounted for a remarkable 43% of GDP in 1996.
Excess Capacity. As might be expected, as the volume of
investments ballooned during the 1990s, often at the bequest of national
governments, so the quality of many of these investments declined
significantly. All too often, the investments were made on the basis of
projections about future demand conditions that were unrealistic. The result
was the emergence of significant excess capacity.
A case in point were investments made by Korean chaebol in semi-conductor
factories. Investments in such facilities surged in 1994 and 1995 when
a temporary global shortage of Dynamic Random Access Memory chips (DRAMs)
led to sharp price increases for this product. However, by 1996 supply
shortages had disappeared and excess capacity was beginning to make itself
felt, just as the Koreans started to bring new DRAM factories on stream.
The results were predictable; prices for DRAMs plunged through the floor
and the earnings of Korean DRAM manufacturers fell by 90%, which meant
it was extremely difficult for them to make scheduled payments on the debt
they had taken on to build the extra capacity in the first place.

In another example, a building boom in Thailand resulted in the emergence
of excess capacity in residential and commercial property. By early 1997
it was estimated that there were 365,000 apartment units unoccupied in
Bangkok. With another 100,000 units scheduled to be completed in 1997,
it was clear that years of excess demand in the Thai property market had
been replaced by excess supply. By one estimate, by 1997 Bangkok�s building
boom had produced enough excess space to meet its residential and commercial
need for at least five years.

The Debt Bomb. By early 1997 what was happening in the Korean
semi-conductor industry and the Bangkok property market was being played
out elsewhere in the region. Massive investments in industrial assets and
property had created a situation of excess capacity and plunging prices,
while leaving the companies that had made the investments groaning under
huge debt burdens that they were now finding difficult to service.

To make matters worse, much of the borrowing to
fund these investments had been in US dollars, as opposed to
local currencies. At the time this had seemed like a smart move. Throughout
the region local currencies were pegged to the dollar, and interest rates
on dollar borrowings were generally lower than rates on borrowings in domestic
currency. Thus, it often made economic sense to borrow in dollars if the
option was available. However, if the governments in the region could not
maintain the dollar peg and their currencies started to depreciate against
the dollar, this would increase the size of the debt burden that local
companies would have to service, when measured in the local currency. Currency
depreciation, in other words, would raise borrowing costs and could result
in companies defaulting on their debt payments.
In this regard, a final complicating factor was that by the mid 1990s
although exports were still expanding across the region, so were imports.
The investments in infrastructure, industrial
capacity, and commercial real estate were sucking in foreign goods at unprecedented
rates. To build infra-structure, factories, and office buildings,
SE Asian countries were purchasing capital equipment and materials from
America, Europe, and Japan. Boeing and Airbus were crowing about the number
of commercial jet aircraft they were selling to Asian airlines. Semi-conductor
equipment companies such as Applied Materials and Lam Materials were boasting
about the huge orders they were receiving from Asia. Motorola, Nokia, and
Ericsson were falling over themselves to sell wireless telecommunications
equipment to Asian nations. And companies selling electric power generation
equipment such as ABB and General Electric were booking record orders across
the region.

Reflecting growing imports, many SE Asian states saw the current account
of their Balance of Payments shift strongly into the red during the mid
1990s. By 1995 Indonesia was running a current account deficit that was
equivalent to 3.5% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Malaysia�s was
5.9%, and Thailand�s was 8.1%. With deficits like these starting to pile
up, it was becoming increasingly difficult for the governments of these
countries to maintain the peg of their currencies against the US dollar.
If that peg could not be held, the local currency value of dollar dominated
debt would increase, raising the specter of large scale default on debt
service payments. The scene was now set for a potentially rapid economic
meltdown.
Meltdown in Thailand
The Asian meltdown began on February 5th, 1997 in
Thailand. That was the date that Somprasong Land, a Thai property developer,
announced that it had failed to make a scheduled $3.1 million interest
payment on an $80 billion eurobond loan, effectively entering into defaulting.
Somprasong Land was the first victim of speculative overbuilding in the
Bangkok property market. The Thai stock market had already declined by
45% since its high in early 1996, primarily on concerns that several property
companies might be forced into bankruptcy. Now one had been. The stock
market fell another 2.7% on the news, but it was only the beginning.

In the aftermath of Somprasong�s default it became clear that not only
were several other property developers teetering on the brink on default;
so where many of the country�s financial institutions including Finance
One, the country�s largest financial institution. Finance One had pioneered
a practice that had become widespread among Thai institutions --- issuing
eurobonds denominated in US dollars and using the proceeds to finance lending
to the country�s booming property developers. In theory, this practice
made sense because Finance One was able to exploit the interest rate differential
between dollar denominated debt and Thai debt (i.e. Finance One borrowed
in US dollars at a low interest rate, and leant in Thai Bhat at high interest
rates). The only problem with this financing strategy was that when the
Thai property market began to unravel in 1996 and 1997, the property developers
could no longer payback the cash that they had borrowed from Finance One.
In turn, this made it difficult for Finance One to pay back its creditors.
As the effects of over-building became evident in 1996, Finance One�s non-performing
loans doubled, then doubled again in the first quarter of 1997.
In February 1997, trading in the shares of Finance One was suspended
while the government tried to arrange for the troubled company to be acquired
by a small Thai bank, in a deal sponsored by the Thai central bank. It
didn�t work, and when trading resumed in Finance One shares in may they
fell 70% in a single day. By this time it was clear that bad loans in the
Thai property market were swelling daily, and had risen to over $30 billion.
Finance One was bankrupt and it was feared that others would follow.
It was at this point that currency traders began a concerted attack
on the Thai currency, the baht. For the previous 13 years the Thai baht
had been pegged to the US dollar at an exchange rate of around $1=Bt25.
This peg, however, had become increasingly difficult to defend. Currency
traders looking at Thailand�s growing current account deficit and dollar
denominated debt burden, reasoned that demand for dollars in Thailand would
rise while demand for Baht would fall. (Businesses and financial institutions
would be exchanging baht for dollars to service their debt payments and
purchase imports). There were several attempts to force a devaluation of
the baht in late 1996 and early 1997. These speculative attacks typical
involved traders selling Baht short in order to profit from a future decline
in the value of the baht against the dollar. In this context, short selling
involves a currency trader borrowing baht from a financial institution
and immediately reselling those baht in the foreign exchange market for
dollars. The theory here is that if the value of the baht subsequently
falls against the dollar, then when the trader has to buy the baht back
to repay the financial institution it will cost her less dollars than she
received from the initial sale of baht. For example, a trader might borrow
Bt100 from a bank for a period of six months. The trader then exchanges
the Bt100 for $4 (at an exchange rate of $1=Bt25). If the exchange rate
subsequently declines to $1=Bt50 it will only cost the trader $2 to repurchase
the Bt100 in six months and pay back the bank, leaving the trader with
a 100% profit! Of course, since short selling involves selling Baht for
dollars, if enough traders engage in this practice, it can become a self-fulfilling
prophecy!
In May 1997 short sellers were swarming over the Thai baht. In an attempt
to defend the peg, the Thai government used its foreign exchange reserves
(which were denominated in US dollars) to purchase Thai baht. It cost the
Thai government $5 billion to defend the baht, which reduced its "officially
reported" foreign exchange reserves to a two-year low of $33 billion. In
addition, the Thai government raised key interest rates from 10% to 12.5%
to make holding Baht more attractive, but since this also raised corporate
borrowing costs it only served to exacerbate the debt crisis.
What the world financial community did not know at this point, was that
with the blessing of his superiors, a foreign exchange trader at the Thai
central bank had locked up most of Thailand�s foreign exchange reserves
in forward contracts. The reality was that Thailand only had $1.14 billion
in available foreign exchange reserves left to defend the dollar peg. Defending
the peg was clearly now impossible.
On July 2nd, 1997, the Thai government bowed to the inevitable and announced
that they would allow the baht to float freely against the dollar. The
baht immediately lost 18% of its value, and started a slide that would
bring the exchange rate down to $1=Bt55 by January 1988. As the baht declined,
so the Thai debt bomb exploded. Put simply, a 50% decline in the value
of the baht against the dollar doubled the amount of baht required to serve
the dollar denominated debt commitments taken on by Thai financial institutions
and businesses. This made more bankruptcies such as Finance One all further
pushed down the battered Thai stock market. The Thailand Set stock market
index ultimately declined from 787 in January 1997 to a low of 337 in December
of that year, and this on top of a 45% decline in 1996!
On July 28th the Thai government took the next logical step,
and called in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With its foreign exchange
reserves depleted, Thailand lacked the foreign currency needed to finance
its international trade and service debt commitments, and was in desperate
need of the capital the IMF could provide. Moreover, it desperately needed
to restore international confidence in its currency, and needed the credibility
associated with gaining access to IMF funds. Without IMF loans, it was
likely that the baht would increase its free-fall against the US dollar,
and the whole country might go into default. IMF loans, however, come with
tight strings attached. The IMF agreed to provide the Thai government with
$17.2 billion in loans, but the conditions were restrictive. The IMF required
the Thai government to increase taxes, cut public spending, privatize several
state owned businesses, and raise interest rates � all steps designed to
cool Thailand�s overheated economy. Furthermore, the IMF required Thailand
to close illiquid financial institutions. In the event, in December 1997
the government shut some 56 financial institutions, laying off 16,000 people
in the process, and further deepening the recession that now gripped the
country.
The Domino Effect
Following the devaluation of the Thai baht, wave
after wave of speculation hit other Asian currencies. One after
another in a period of weeks the Malaysian ringgit, Indonesian rupiah and
the Singapore dollar were all marked sharply lower. With its foreign exchange
reserves down to $28 billion, Malaysia let its currency, the ringgit, float
on July 14th, 1997. Prior to the devaluation, the ringgit was
trading at $1=2.525 ringgit. Six months later it had declined to $1=4.15
ringgit. Singapore followed on July 17th, and the Singapore
dollar (S$) quickly dropped in value from $1=S$1.495 prior to the devaluation
to $1=S$2.68 a few days later. Next up was Indonesia, whose currency, the
Rupiah, was allowed to float on August 14th. For Indonesia,
this was the beginning of a precipitous decline in the value of its currency,
which was to fall from $1=2,4000 Rupiah in August 1997 to $1=10,000 on
January 6th, 1998, a loss of 75%.
With the exception of Singapore, whose economy is probably the most
stable in the region, these devaluations were driven by similar factors
to those that underlay the earlier devaluation of the Thai baht. A combination
of excess investment, high borrowings, much of it in dollar denominated
debt, and a deteriorating balance of payments position. The leaders of
these countries, however, were not always quick to acknowledge the home
grown nature of their problems.
Malaysia. As the ringgit declined against the US dollar,
the Malaysia�s Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohammed, gave speeches asserting
that the international financier, George Soros, was the arch villain in
a conspiracy to impoverish Southeast Asian nations by attacking their currencies.
According to Dr. Mahathir, foreign fund managers were selling Malaysian
shares because they were racists; currency traders were ignoring Malaysia�s
sound economic fundamentals; the West was gloating over the crisis in SE
Asia; rumor mongers who "should be shot" were spreading lies and a "Jewish"
agenda was at work against the country. Unfortunately for Dr. Mahathir,
every time he gave free rein to his thoughts on the matter, the Malaysian
currency and stock market declined even further. He even tried to outlaw
short selling on the Malaysian stock market, but this too had the opposite
effect of that intended, and the policy had to be pulled shortly after
it was introduced.
By Autumn Malaysia�s government seems to have come around to the view
that it needed to put its own house in order, rather than blame others
for its problems. In early September the government deferred spending on
several high profile infra-structure projects including its prestigious
Bakun dam project. This was followed in December 1997 by the release of
plans to cut state spending by 18%. The government also stated that it
will not bail out any corporations that become insolvent as a result of
excess borrowing. Then in January 1998, IMF managing director Michel Camdessus,
stated that Malaysia was correct in asserting that it did not need an IMF
rescue package to get it through the regional financial crisis. "Malaysia
is not facing a crisis in the same way as some of the other countries in
the region, " he said, noting the authorities have taken measures to deal
with the difficulties, particularly on the fiscal side. On the other hand,
he did state that the government needed to raise interest rates to slow
credit growth, moderate inflationary pressures and support the weakening
currency.
Indonesia. Indonesia authorities also initially respond
with something less than full commitment to that country�s financial crisis.
Following speculative selling, the Indonesia currency, the rupiah, was
uncoupled from its dollar peg and allowed to float on August 14th,
1997. The rupiah immediately started to decline, as did the Indonesian
stock market. By October the rupiah had dropped from $1=Rp2,400 in early
August to $1=Rp4,000, and the Jakarta stock market index had declined from
just over 700 to under 500. At this point the now desperate Indonesian
government turned to the IMF for financial assistance. After several weeks
of intense negotiations, on October 31st the IMF announced that
in conjunction with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank it had
put together a $37 billion rescue deal for Indonesia. In return, the Indonesian
government agreed to close a number of troubled banks, to reduce public
spending, balance the budget, and unravel the crony capitalism that was
so widespread in Indonesia.
The initial response to the IMF deal was favorable, with the rupiah
strengthening to $1=Rp3,200. However, the recovery was short lived. As
November lengthened so the rupiah resumed its decline in response to growing
skepticism about President Suharto�s willingness to take the tough steps
required by the IMF. Moreover, currency traders wondered how Indonesia
was going to be able to deal with its dollar denominated private sector
debt, which stood at $80 billion. With both the economy and exchange rate
collapsing, there was clearly no way that private sector enterprises would
be able to generate the rupiah required to purchase the dollars needed
to service the debt, and so the decline feed on itself. In December Moody�s,
the US credit rating agency, feed fuel to this fire when it downgraded
Indonesia�s credit rating to junk bond status.
On January 5th 1998 President Suharto seemed to confirm the
skepticism of currency traders when he unveiled Indonesia�s 1998-99 budget.
The budget immediately came in for criticism because it made optimistic
assumptions about Indonesia�s economic growth rate in 1998. It projected
GDP growth at 4%, inflation contained at single digit levels (in 1997 it
was around 20%), and assumed a rupiah-US dollar exchange rate of $1=Rp4,000
(the rupiah closed 1997 at an exchange rate of $1=Rp5,005). Moreover, no
plans were announced to abolish the lucrative state licensing monopolies
that had benefited his family and friends. An "unnamed" IMF sokesman informed
the Washington Post that the Indonesia government did not seem to be following
through on pledges to restructure the economy and warned that the IMF might
hold back funds. International investors and currency traders responded
by selling their rupiah holdings, or selling the rupiah short, and the
exchange rate plunged through the floor, hitting $1=Rp10,000 a few days
later.
At this point IMF officials, together with US deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, made a second visit to Jakarta to "re-negotiate" the
IMF terms of agreement. On January 15th they reached a revised
agreement which committed Indonesia to a tough budget. Among other things,
this pledged budget cuts, including cuts in sensitive energy subsidies,
trade deregulation that would wipe out many of the business privileges
enjoyed by Suharto�s family and friends, and accelerated structural reform
of the banking sector.
Whether Suharto will follow through on these commitments, however, remains
to be seen. On January 20th the 76 year old President announced
his intention to run for a seventh term as President. The outcome does
not seem to be in doubt, since the election in undertaken by hand picked
delegates, and Suharto faces no opponent. The rupiah, meanwhile, which
was trading at around $1=Rp8,5000 just before the announcement, dropped
sharply, reaching an all time low of $1=Rp14,500 on January 22nd,
1998 before clawing its way bask up to $1=Rp12,5000.
The sharp drop reflected two concerns. First, fear that Suharto�s apparent
unwillingness to step down in the face of an economic collapse may lead
to social breakdown and political violence in Indonesia. Second, growing
realization that hundreds of Indonesian businesses were now technically
insolvent and would not be able to pay back the estimated $65 billion of
dollar denominated debt they owed without substantial debt restructuring
and rescheduling of the debt payments. The IMF deal, for all of its good
points, had not addressed this critical issue.
South Korea. Initially South
Korea seemed to be insolated from the currency turmoil sweeping through
the region. As the world�s 11th largest economy,
and a member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development,
Korea was clearly in a different league from Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
However, underneath the surface Korea too had serious problems
During much of the 1990s foreign banks had been eager to lend US dollars
to Korean Banks and the chaebol. A significant proportion of this
was short term debt that had to be paid back within a year. This
money was used to fund investments in industrial capacity, which as suggested
earlier, were often undertaken at the encouragement of the government.
By late 1996 it was clear that the debt financed expansion was beginning
to unravel. Economic growth had slowed, excess capacity was emerging in
a number of industries, prices for critical industrial products such as
semi-conductors were falling, and imports were on the rise (Korea ran a
current account deficit of $23.7 billion in 1996).
The Korean debt problem started to deteriorate in January 1997 when
one of the chaebol, Hanbo collapsed under a $6 billion debt load.
A 1993 decision to build the world's fifth largest steel mill proved to
be Hanbo�s undoing. Costs for the project escalated from Won 2,700bn to
Won 5,700bn while steel demand proved sluggish. Following Hanbo�s collapse
there were widespread allegations in Korea that the project had been funded
only because of the government pressured Korean banks to lend to Hanbo.
Moreover, allegations soon surfaced that government officials had been
bribed by Hanbo to pressure the banks.
The situation deteriorated further in July 1997 when Kia, Korea�s third
largest car company, ran out of cash and asked for an emergency bank loan
to avoid bankruptcy. At about the same time Jinaro, Korea�s largest liquor
group, filed for bankruptcy. These events prompted international credit
agencies to start downgrading the ratings of banks with heavy exposure
to the chaebol. This raised the borrowing costs of the banks, and
led them to tighten credit, making it even more difficult for debt heavy
chaebol
to borrow additional funds. By October 1997 it was clear that additional
funds for Kia would not be forthcoming from private banks, so the government
took the company into public ownership in order to stave off bankruptcy
and job losses. This followed hard on the heels of a decision by the Korean
government to invest an equity stake in Korea First Bank, to stop that
institution from collapsing due to a its bad loans. The nationalization
of Kia transformed its private sector debt into public sector debt. Standard
& Poor�s, the US credit rating agency, immediately downgraded Korea�s
debt, causing the Korean stock market to plunge 5.5%, and the currency,
the Korean won, to fall to $1=Krw929.5. According to S&P, "the downgrade
of�..ratings reflects the escalating cost to the government of supporting
the country's ailing corporate and financial sectors."
The S&P downgrade was the trigger that precipitated a sharp sell-off
of the Korean won. In an attempt to protect the won, the Korean central
bank raised short term interest rates to over 12%, more than double the
inflation rate. The bank also intervened in the currency exchange markets,
selling dollars and purchasing won in an attempt to keep the dollar/won
exchange rate above $1=Krw1,000. The main effect of this action, however,
was to rapidly deplete its foreign exchange reserves. These stood at $30
billion on November 1st, but fell to only $15 billion two weeks
later.
To make matters worse, the wave of bankruptcies continued among the
chaebol.
Haitai, Korea's 24th largest business, filed for bankruptcy protection
at the beginning of November, and rumors suggests that New Core, another
chaebol
would soon follow. This meant that one-fifth of the country�s thirty largest
businesses had now filed for bankruptcy protection. Moreover, there was
speculation that as many as half of the top 30 chaebol might ultimately
have to file for bankruptcy. International lenders, fearing that Korea
was about to become a financial black whole, refused to roll over short-term
loans to the country, an action made all the more serious by revelations
that Korea had about $100 billion in short term debt obligations that had
to be paid within 12 months.
With Korea facing imminent financial meltdown, the prospect of an IMF
led bailout of the country was being openly discussed. On November 13th,
the Korean government declared that it "did not need help from the IMF",
apparently believing that it would be able to arrange bilateral loans from
the US and Japan. They were not forthcoming, and on November 17th,
with the nation�s foreign exchange reserves almost exhausted, the Korean
Central bank gave up its defense of the won. The won immediately fell below
the psychologically important $1=Krw1,000 exchange rate, and it kept going
south. On November 21st the now humiliated Korean government
was forced to reverse course and formally requested $20 billion in standby
loans from the IMF.
The process was complicated considerably at this point by the fact that
Korea was facing a presidential election campaign on December 18th.
The IMF, therefore, had to negotiate terms with a lame duck President,
Kim Young-sam, who has required to step down by the constitution, while
the three main candidates criticized the process from the sidelines. As
the negotiations progressed, it soon became apparent that Korea was going
to need far more than $20 billion. Among other problems, Korea�s short
term foreign debt was found to be twice as large as previously thought
at close to $100 billion, while the country�s foreign exchange reserves
were down to under $6 billion.
On December 3rd the IMF and Korean government reached a deal
to lend $55 billion to the country. The IMF had tried to insist that all
three Presidential candidates promise, in writing, to obey the agreement.
However, Kim Dae-jung, the centre-left opposition leader, said he would
refuse to sign any guarantee with the IMF because "it violated national
pride," although he did signal general compliance with the measures. The
agreement with the IMF called for the Koreans to open up their economy
and banking system to foreign investors. Prior to the deal foreigners could
only own 7% of a Korean company's shares. This was lifted to 50%. South
Korea also pledged to restrain the chaebol by reducing their share of bank
financing and requiring them to publish consolidated financial statements
and undergo annual independent external audits. On trade liberalization,
the IMF said South Korea will comply with its commitments to the World
Trade Organization to eliminate trade-related subsidies and restrictive
import licensing, and streamline its import- certification procedures,
all of which should open up the Korean economy to greater foreign competition.
Initial reaction in the stock and currency markets was very favorable,
with the Korean stock marketing registering a 7% gain, its biggest one
day advance ever. However, the package started to unravel on December 8th
when the Korean government said that it would take two trouble banks into
public ownership, rather than closing them. On the same day, Daewoo, one
of the chaebol, announced that it would purchase debt laden Ssangyong
Motor under a deal that forced Ssangyong�s creditor banks to share much
of the burden. Foreign investors saw these moves as an attempt to get around
the harsh measures imposed by the IMF. Further compounding matters were
criticisms from presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung. Kim argued that the
IMF agreement represented a loss of national sovereignty and he promised
that, if elected, he would renegotiate the deal to avoid job losses. In
response to these developments, foreign banks refused to roll over short
term loans investors sold out of the Korean stock market and won, and both
dropped like stones. The won began a precipitous fall that was to take
it down to the 2,000 level in two short weeks, a decline that effectively
doubled the amount of won Korean companies would have to earn to finance
their dollar denominated debt. By mid December foreign banks were only
rolling over 20-30% of Korean short term debt as it matured, requiring
that the rest be paid in full. Despite the IMF funds, foreign currency
was leaving the country at the rate of $1 billion a day.
Following pressure from the other presidential candidates, Kim Dae-jung,
reversed his position and sent a letter to Michael Camdessus, the head
of the IMF, stating that if elected, he would comply with the IMF�s terms.
On December 18th, Kim Dae-jung was elected president of South
Korea by a narrow margin. He immediately turned his attention to the debt
crisis. His attention was heightened by the uncomfortable fact that Korea
was on the verge of default. His first priority was to rebuild confidence
and persuade foreign banks to roll over Korean short term debt, thereby
staving off an immediate default. The international community was also
concerned by the possibility that a Korean default would trigger a banking
crisis in Japan, which held $25 billion of Korean debt, an event that would
send economic shock waves surging around the world.
In the event, a second agreement was reached between Korea, the IMF,
and a number of major American and British banks with large exposure to
Korea. Singed on Christmas Eve, the agreement called for the IMF and eight
major banks to accelerate a loan of $10 billion to Korea to prevent a debt
default. For his part, Kim Dae-jung spelled out in clear language that
Korean businesses and jobs could no longer be protected from foreign competition.
Korea also agreed to an accelerated timetable for opening up its financial
markets to foreign investors, permitting foreign takeovers, and allowing
foreign companies to establish subsidiaries in Korea. The government also
agreed to raise interest rates in order to attract foreign capital, force
the chaebol to restructure their operations, selling-off loss making units
and demanding clearer accounting. If the government follows through with
these reforms, the effect could be to transform Korea�s economy from one
in which the government plaid a major role in regulating and directing
investment activity into one of the most market-oriented economies in Asia.
In response, for now Korean stock and currency markets have stabilized,
but it would be naive to expect anything approaching a full recovery until
the country has put its house in order.
The situation in South Korea improved still further on January 28th,
1998 when a consortium of 13 international banks with exposure to Korea
agreed to reschedule their short term debt to Korea. According to the Bank
for International Settlements, In early 1998 South Korea was sitting on
$74 billion in debt that was coming due for repayment in the next two years.
This added up to a cash flow squeeze of major proportions that the earlier
IMF deal had fully come to grips with. Under the plan South Korean banks
will exchange short term debt valued at $24 billion for new loans with
maturities of one, two, and three years, bearing interest rates of 2.23,
2.50, and 2.75 percentage points higher than the six month London Interbank
rate. By effectively rescheduling so much of its short term debt, the deal
gave South Korea some breathing room in which it could begin to rebuild
confidence in its shattered economy.
Japan. As the crisis unfolded,
most Japanese felt that it had little to do with them. At worst,
there was some concerns that the turmoil might harm some of the nation�s
exporters. Indeed, the main issue for debate was whether Japan should take
a leadership role in handling the crisis. This sense of insulation was
always rather myopic given that Japanese banks had major exposure throughout
Asia. For example, more than half of the total foreign lending to Thailand
was by Japanese Banks. The possibility always existed, therefore, that
a collapse in many of the SE Asian economies could have serious repercussions
for Japan.
The confidence of the Japanese was finally shaken on November the 3rd
1997, when Sanyo Securities, the nation�s seventh largest stock brokerage
firm, announced that it would file for bankruptcy. This was followed on
November 17th by the collapse of Hokkaido Takushoku, Japan�s
10th largest bank, and on November 22nd, by the announcement
that Yamaichi Securities, the fourth largest stock-broker in Japan, would
close its doors. The Japanese stock market fell on the news to its lowest
level in years, and for a moment it looked like the Asian financial crisis
might spill over into Japan.
The closure of these three institutions dated back to events almost
a decade earlier. In the late 1980s when Japan�s stock market and property
bubble was at its peak, Japan�s financial institutions went on a lending
binge. In 1989 the Nikki stock market index briefly rose to within striking
distance of 40,000 before the bubble burst and the market fell to 15,000
three years later. Following the collapse of stock and property prices
in Japan, many of the loans made in the bubble years became non-performing.
They were, however, kept on the books for years as performing loans, often
with the tacit support of the Bank of Japan, in hopes that the companies
involved would work their way out of financial difficulties. Moreover,
many financial institutions held a good portion of their asset in stock.
With the collapse in the value of the Japanese stock market, the value
of these assets had also plummeted, leaving the institutions with a diminished
asset base and an increased portfolio of non-performing loans. To compound
matters even further, security houses such as Yamaichi frequently guaranteed
major customers a certain minimum rate of return on and investments they
managed for the customer, and would make up the difference from their own
pocket if they failed to exceed that minimum. In the years that followed
the 1989 collapse, this meant that Yamaichi and its kin had to absorb losses
associated with business taken on at the height of the boom. The securities
houses also indulged in the questionable practice of tobashi in
which brokerages temporarily shift investment losses from one client to
another to prevent a favored customer from having to report losses.
There is only so long that a bank or security house can continue to
undertake such practices without an improvement in their underlying fundamentals.
After eight years of recession, in late 1997 that time had arrived for
Sanyo Securities, Hokkaido Takushoku, and Yamaichi Securities. All three
were sinking under the burden of excessive debt and non-performing loans.
That all three had survived this long was a testament to the willingness
of Japan�s powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF) to guarantee support for
the country�s shaky financial institutions. That all three collapsed in
late 1997 signaled a clear change of course by the Ministry of Finance.
Exactly why the MOF decided to change course is not completely clear.
Some speculate that the MOF wanted a "shock" of this sort to persuade politicians
and the public to use public funds to help bail out Japan�s troubled financial
sector (up until this point there had been widespread resistance to using
public funds for this purpose). Another factor in the Yamaichi case was
that Fuji Bank, the traditional ally of the securities firm, finally withdrew
its support. In any event, the result was to send the Japanese stock market
into a steep fall. With investors fearing that more bankruptcies might
follow, the Nikki Index declined from 17,000 to close to 14,500. The 14,000
level is particularly significant in Japan, where financial institutions
hold assets in the form of stock. If the Nikki falls below 14,000, many
financial institutions will not have enough assets on their books to cover
their liabilities, and they will have to sell stock to reduce the ratio.
Once this happens, the Japanese market could implode, transforming the
country�s long running recession into a full blown economic depression.
A depression in the world�s second largest economy would have disastrous
implications for the health of the global economic system.
It was at this point that Japanese government stepped in with the announcement
that it planned to use public funds to guarantee Yamaichi�s debts. This
was followed by a commitment to use public finds to recapitalize Japan�s
troubled financial institutions. By January 1998 the amount of public funds
earmarked for this task had reached Y30,000 billion (around $230 billion).
This commitment helped to stabilize Japan�s stock market, and the country
pulled back from the brink of financial meltdown. The commitment of public
funds also illustrate the difference between Japan and the other Asian
countries afflicted by financial crises. Unlike the troubled Tiger economies,
Japan had amassed a huge amount of reserves that could be used shore up
its trouble financial system.
Although Japan did not suffer the fate of other Asian countries, the
problems in Japan did have an impact on the situation, for it considerably
weakened Japan�s ability to step in and take a lead roll in solving the
wider Asian debacle. Instead of Japan, its was left to the IMF, in conjunction
with the United States, to step in and stop the free fall in Asian stock
markets and currencies. The credibility of Japan both as a source of stability
within the region, and as the de-facto economic leader of the Asia Pacific
economies, has been severely and perhaps permanently damaged by its inability
to take a leadership role in solving the crisis.
Aftermath: Implications of the Crisis.
Although the economic storm that swept through Asian in 1997
has now abated, the wreckage left in its wake will undoubtedly take years
to repair. By indulging in a debt binge that ultimately bought its high
flying economies crashing to the ground, Asia may have lost a decade of
economic progress. Beyond this, however, the crisis has raised a series
of fundamental policy questions about the sustainability of the so called
Asian Economic Model, the role of the IMF, and the virtues of floating
and fixed exchange rates. The crisis also has important implications for
international businesses. For a decade, the Asian Pacific region has been
promoted by many as the future economic engine of the world economy. Businesses
have invested billions of dollars in the region on the assumption that
the rapid growth of the last decade would continue. Now it has come grinding
to a halt. What does this mean for international businesses with a stake
in the region, and for those that compete against Asian companies? Below
we discuss each of these questions in turn.
The Asian Economic Model. Back in the late 1980s and early
1990s a number of authors were penning articles about the superiority of
the Asian Economic Model or Asian Capitalism. According to its advocates,
the countries of the Asian Pacific region, as exemplified by Japan and
South Korea, had put together the institutions of capitalism in a more
effective way than either the United States or Western European nations.
The so called Asian Model of state directed capitalism seemed to combine
the dynamism of a market economy with the advantages of centralized government
planning (see Chapter 2 for details). It was argued that close cooperation
between government and business to formulate industrial policy led to the
kind of long-term planning and investment that was not possible in the
West. Informal lending practices were credited with giving Asian firms
more flexibility than allowed for by the rigorous disclosure rules imposed
on similar transactions in the United States. And Western admirers praised
government policies designed to encourage exports and protect domestic
producers from imports.
However, economists have argued for some time
that the Asian economic miracle had nothing to do with cooperation between
government and business. Instead, it was the result of high savings rates,
good education systems, and rapid growth in the labor force.
Many warned that the Asian proclivity for government directed investment
and poorly regulated financial systems was a dangerous mix that could lead
to over investment, excessive debt, and financial crises. Despite the occurrence
of just such a crisis in Japan in 1989, advocates of the Asian Way, including
many leading politicians in Asia, steadfastly ignored the risks inherent
in an interventionist economic model. Instead, they continued to sing the
praises of business-government cooperation and "Confucian values", right
up to the explosion of the debt bomb and the collapse of their stock markets
and currencies in late 1997.
Now that the crash has occurred, momentum in Asia is starting to shift
away from the "Asian Way" and towards the Western economic model. Pushed
in part by the IMF, but also by shifting opinion among some politicians
and business leaders within the region, Asia�s troubled economies seem
to be embarking on a long overdue restructuring. Governments are pulling
back from close cooperation with businesses, financial disclosure regulations
are being tightened, troubled banks and companies have been allowed to
fail, and markets are being deregulated to allow for greater competition
and foreign direct investment. As a consequence, it seems reasonable predict
that many Asian economies will come to resemble, more closely, the free
market system championed by the United States than the Asian model exemplified
by the Japan of the 1980s.
The International Monetary Fund. The Asian financial crisis
has been the biggest test for the IMF since the Latin American debt crisis
of the 1980s, and perhaps the biggest test since the institution was founded
in 1944 (see Chapter 10 for details). The original charge of the IMF was
to lend money to member countries that were experiencing balance of payments
problems, and could not maintain the value of their currencies. The idea
was that the IMF would provide short term financial loans to troubled countries,
giving them time to put their economies in order. IMF loans have always
came with strings attached. In the past, most recipients of IMF aid have
suffered from excessive government spending, lax monetary policy and high
inflation. Consequently, conditions attached to IMF loans have normally
required the borrowing country to slash government spending and raise interest
rates to slow monetary growth and inflation.
As a result of the Asian crisis, in late 1997 the IMF found itself committing
over $110 billion in short term loans to three countries; South Korea,
Indonesia, and Thailand. To put this in perspective, the largest loan prior
to this was the $48 billion package that the IMF gave to Mexico in 1995
following the collapse of the Mexican peso. As with other aid packages,
the IMF loans come with conditions attached. The IMF is insisting on a
combination of tight macro-economic policies, including cuts in public
spending and higher interest rates, the deregulation of sectors formally
protected from domestic and foreign competition, and better financial reporting
from the banking sector. Although politicians in each country initially
resisted these conditions, they ultimately accepted them and so far at
least, seem to be pursuing them. Despite the acquiescence of local politicians,
the IMF policies towards Asian countries have come in for unusually tough
criticisms from many Western observers.
One criticism is that tight macro-economic policies are inappropriate
for countries that are suffering not from excessive government spending
and inflation, but from a private sector debt crisis with deflationary
undertones. In Korea, for example, the government has been running a budget
surplus for years (it was 4% of Korea�s GDP in the 1994-1996 period) and
inflation is low at around 5%. Indeed, Korea has the second strongest financial
position of any country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. Despite this, say critics, the IMF is insisting on applying
the same policies that it applies to countries suffering from high inflation.
The IMF is requiring Korea to maintain an inflation rate of 5%. However,
given the collapse in the value of its currency, and the subsequent rise
in price for imports such as oil, inflationary pressures will inevitably
increase in Korea. So to hit a 5% inflation rate, the Koreans are being
forced to apply an unnecessarily tight monetary policy. Short term interest
rates in Korea jumped from 12.5% to 21% immediately after Korea signed
its initial deal with the IMF. The essential problem here is that increasing
interest rates make it even more difficult for Korean companies to service
their already excessive short term debt obligations; that is, the cure
prescribed by the IMF may actually increase the probability of widespread
corporate defaults in Korea, not reduce them.
For its part, the IMF rejects this criticism. According to the IMF,
the critical task is to rebuild confidence in the Korean currency, the
won. Once this has been achieved, the won will recover from its extremely
oversold levels. This will reduce the size of Korea�s dollar denominate
debt burden when expressed in won, in turn making it easier for Korean
companies to service their dollar denominated debt. The IMF also argues
that by requiring Korea to remove restrictions on foreign direct investment,
foreign capital will flow into Korea to take advantage of cheap assets.
This too, will increase demand for the Korean currency, and help to improve
the dollar/won exchange rate.
A second criticism of the IMF is that its rescue efforts are exacerbating
a problem know to economists as moral hazard. Moral hazard arises
when people behave recklessly because they know they will be saved if things
go wrong. In the case of Asia, critics point out that many Japanese and
Western banks were far too willing to lend large amounts of capital to
over-leveraged Asian companies during the boom years of the 1990s. These
critics argue that the banks should now be forced to pay the price for
their rash lending policies, even if that means some banks must shut down.
Only by taking such drastic action, so the argument goes, will banks learn
the error of their ways and not engage in rash lending in the future. By
providing support to these countries, the IMF is reducing the probability
of debt default, and in effect bailing out the very banks whose loans gave
rise to this situation in the first place.
The problem with this argument is that it ignores two critical points.
First, if some Japanese or Western banks with heavy exposure to the troubled
Asian economies were forced to write off their loans due to widespread
debt default, this would have an impact that would be difficult to contain.
The failure of large Japanese banks, for example, could trigger a meltdown
in the Japanese financial markets. In turn, this would almost inevitably
lead to a serious decline in stock markets around the world. That is the
very risk that the IMF was trying to avoid in the first place by stepping
in with financial support. Second, it is incorrect to imply that some banks
have not had to pay the price for rash lending policies. In fact, the IMF
has insisted on the closure of banks in Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
Moreover, foreign banks with short term-loans outstanding to Korean enterprises
have been essentially forced by circumstances to reschedule those loans
at interest rates that do not compensate for the extension of the loan
maturity.
The final criticism of the IMF is that is has become too powerful for
an institution that lacks any real mechanism for accountability. By the
end of 1997, the IMF was engaged in loan programs in 75 developing countries
that collectively contain 1.4 billion people. The IMF was determining macro-economic
policies in those countries, yet according to critics such as noted Harvard
economist Jeffery Sachs, with a staff of under 1,000 the IMF lacks the
in-depth expertise required to do a good job. Evidence of this, according
to Sachs, can be found in the fact that the IMF was singing the praises
of the Thai and South Korean governments only months before both countries
lurched into crisis. Then the IMF put together a draconian program for
Korea without having deep knowledge of the country. Sachs solution to this
problem is to reform the IMF, so that it makes greater use of outside experts,
and so that its operations are open to great outside review and scrutiny.
Implications for Exchange Rate Policy. As outlined in
chapter 10 of this book, there is a long running debate in international
business and economics between those who favor fixed exchange rate mechanisms,
and those who favor a floating system. Since the collapse of the Bretton
Woods� fixed exchange rate system in 1973, the world has functioned with
a floating exchange rate system (see Chapter 10). However, there are variations
to this theme. Most Asian countries tried to peg the value of their currency
against the US dollar, intervening selectively in the foreign exchange
markets to support the value of their currency. This practice, know as
a managed float, is an attempt to achieve some of the benefits associated
with a fixed exchange rate regime in a world of that lacks such a regime.
Critics argue that such a policy is vulnerable to speculative pressure.
The events that unfolded in the fall of 1997 have given the critics additional
ammunition. The value of the Korean, Indonesia, Thai, and Malaysian currencies
did not just decline against the dollar, they collapsed in spectacular
fashion, illustrating the sometimes extreme results of speculative attacks
on a currency in a world of floating exchange rates.
The experience of Hong Kong during the crisis, however, has added a
new dimension to the debate. Hong Kong was able to maintain the value of
its currency against the US dollar at around $1=HK$7.8, despite several
concerted speculative attacks. How did it manage to do this? One answer
that has been offered is that Hong Kong operates with a currency board.
A country that introduces a currency board commits itself to converting
its domestic currency on demand into another currency at a fixed exchange
rate. To make this commitment credible, the currency board holds reserves
of foreign currency equal at the fixed exchange rate to at least 100% of
the domestic currency issued. So for example, the system used in Hong Kong
means that its currency must be fully backed by the US dollar at the specified
exchange rate. Of course, this is not a true fixed exchange rate regime,
since the US dollar, and by extension the Hong Kong dollar, floats against
other currencies, but it does has some of the features of a fixed exchange
rate regime.
Under this arrangement, the currency board can only issue additional
domestic notes and coins when there are foreign exchange reserves to back
it. This limits the ability of the government to print money and, thereby,
create inflationary pressures. Under a strict currency board system, interest
rates adjust automatically. If investors want to switch out of domestic
currency into, for example, US dollars, the supply of domestic currency
will shrink. This will cause interest rates to rise until it eventually
becomes attractive for investors to hold the local currency again. In the
case of Hong Kong, the interest rate on 3 month depots climbed as high
as 20% in late 1997, as investors switched out of Hong Kong dollars and
into US dollars. The dollar peg, however, held and interest rates declined
again.
Since its establishment in 1983, the Hong Kong currency board has weathered
several storms, including the latest. This success seems to be persuading
other countries in the developing world to consider a similar system. Argentina
introduced a currency board in 1991, and Bulgaria, Estonia and Lithuania
have all gone down this road in recent years. Despite growing interest
in the arrangement, however, critics are quick to point out that currency
boards have their drawbacks. If local inflation rates remain higher than
the inflation rate in the country to which the currency is pegged, the
currencies of countries with currency boards can become uncompetitive and
overvalued. Moreover, under a currency board system government lacks the
ability to set interest rates. Interest rates in Hong Kong, for example,
are effectively set by the American Federal Reserve. Despite these drawbacks,
however, Hong Kong�s success in avoiding the currency collapse that afflicted
its Asian neighbors suggests that other developing countries may adopt
a similar system in the future.
Implications for Business. The Asian financial crisis
throws the risks associated with doing business in developing countries
into sharp focus. For most of the 1990s, multinational companies have viewed
Asia as a future economic powerhouse, and invested accordingly. This view
was not without foundation. The region is home to 60% of the world�s people
and a number of dynamic economies that have been growing by nearly 10%
per year for most of the past decade. This euphoric view was rudely shattered
by the events of late 1997. It would be wrong to conclude, however, that
the impact upon companies doing business in the region will be purely negative.
On closer examination, there is a silver lining to many of the storm clouds
hanging over Asia.
On the negative side on the equation, the Asian crisis will undoubtedly
have some painful effects on companies with major activities and investments
in the region�s troubled economies. For example, when the Malaysian government
cancelled its $5 billion Bakun hydro-electric damn project this hurt ABB,
the large European based engineering firm that was a prime contractor on
the project. ABB took a $100 million charge and the Asian slowdown helped
to trigger job cuts totaling 10,000 in many of its European facilities.
Similarly, Boeing expressed concern that the Asian crisis may result in
as many as 60 orders for large jet aircraft being postponed or cancelled.
To make matters worse, many Asian companies will now be looking to export
their way out of recessionary conditions in their home markets. This may
lead to a flood of low priced exports from troubled Asia economies to other
countries. United States and European steel companies, for example, are
bracing themselves to deal with the adverse impact on demand and prices
in their home market of an increased in the supply of low cost steel from
South Korea. The fall in the value of the Korean won against the dollar
has given Korean steel companies a competitive edge in global markets that
they lacked just six months ago.
On the other hand, firms that source components from Asia have seen
a steep drop in the price of those inputs, which has a beneficial impact
on profit margins. For example, Dell Computer, the large US based manufacturer
of personal computers, has seen a 50% drop in the price of certain components
such as memory chips that it buys from Asian manufacturers. Similarly,
even though ABB took a hit when it lost the Bakun Dam project, the company
argues that this will be more than off-set over the next few years by increases
in exports from its own factories based in that region.
Furthermore, several firms are reportedly taking advantage of the changing
circumstances in Asia to increase their rate of investment in the region.
Plunging stock markets across the region have left many Asian companies
trading at prices that are less than their break-up value, while the IMF�s
rescue packages have required Korea, Indonesia, and Thailand to relax restrictions
on inward foreign direct investment. As a result of these factors, it is
reasonable to expect firms from outside of these countries to start buying
the assets of troubled companies while they can be purchased for cents
on the dollar. Indeed, there are signs that that is starting to happen.
In December 1997, for example, Citicorp was reported to be examining the
books of Thailand�s seventh largest bank, First Bangkok City Bank, with
a view to making an acquisition. Citicorp was also reported to be looking
for acquisitions in South Korea
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that despite its dramatic impact, the
long run effects of the crisis may be good not bad. To the extent that
the crisis gives Asian countries an incentive to reform their economic
systems, and to initiate some much need restructuring, they may emerge
from the experience not weaker, but stronger institutions and a greater
ability to attain sustainable economic growth.

Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history

					One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

Euro rallies to 2-year high as hawkish view on ECB dominates

					The euro strengthens on Friday to a two-year high against the dollar, extending its gains, a day after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi attempted to tamp down comments he made back in late June that traders interpreted as hawkish.
					
					
3:21 p.m. July 21, 2017







Dow's early tumble is broad based and led by Goldman, GE and Caterpillar stocks

					The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday was seeing early modest losses on Friday, but the day's early declines were broad based and led by a stumble in shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. Goldman's stock  was shaving about 15 points from the price-weighted blue-chip gauge. Goldman has been sinking since reporting second-quarter results that revealed a 40% fall in its bread-and-butter fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading business. The investment bank performed the worst among its peers in trading revenue. Shares are on track to log their steepest weekly decline since the period ended June 2. Meanwhile, General Electric  and Caterpillar's shares  were cutting a combined 20 points from the Dow. GE's stock turned lower after outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt delivered a downbeat outlook for its full-year 2017 earnings, despite second-quarter results that were better-than-expected. Immelt also offered a downbeat outlook for the oil-and-gas industry, which may have helped to drag industrial giant Caterpillar's shares  lower. The Dow was trading off 0.3% at 21,545, while the S&P 500 index  slumped by 0.2% at 2,468, pressured by a 0.6% retreat in industrials and energy , weighed by a slide in crude-oil prices . The Nasdaq Composite Index  was off 0.2% at 6,376, and threatened to snap a 10-session win streak, matching its longest since Feb. 24, 2015. For the week, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are on pace to posts gains, while the Dow is fighting off a weekly drop, as earnings season gets under way. In other assets, the euro  continued its confounding surge, following the European Central Bank's decision to stand pat on its mix of accommodative policy programs, as ECB President Mario Draghi attempted to tamp down statements made in late June that were viewed as hinting at tapering of easy-money measures begun in the wake of the 2008-'09 financial crisis. The euro was most recently at $1.1647, versus the dollar and up 1.5% on the week, with most of those gains coming Thursday. The 10-year Treasury note , meanwhile, was drawing bidders, pushing yields, which move inversely to prices, lower. The benchmark yield stood at 2.24%.

Asian markets cool off following recent surge 
              
              Equities across the Asia-Pacific region were lower on Friday, taking a breather from the recent surge where gains in Australian shares lagged behind other indexes as sharp moves its currency plagued stocks.

O.J. Simpson granted parole, could be released as early as October from Nevada prison
              
              A Nevada parole board has granted former football star and celebrity O.J. Simpson an early release from Lovelock Correctional Center. The 70-year-old Simpson said during his parole hearing that he has "lived a conflict free" life since being convicted in 2008 of an armed robbery to regain sports memorabilia linked to the ex-athlete. Simpson could be released from the correctional facility as early as October after about nine years in prison. The celebrity appeared emotional after the board's decision. Simpson, along with other men that he enlisted, tried to retrieve sports items that he claims were stolen from him. In 1994, Simpson was found not guilty in the 1994 murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. He later lost a civil suit related to that matter. That case has been the subject of a number of documentaries and movies.

Home Depot slashes 46 points from Dow industrials
              
              The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday was being chopped lower by sharp declines in a duo of components: Home Depot Inc.  and Travelers Cos. Inc. . The pair were exacting a 60-point toll on the price-weighted Dow industrials . Home Depot's shares alone were off 4.4%, and cutting 46 points from the blue chips, with shares of Travelers yanking the Dow down by about 15 points. The reasons for Home Depot's decline was unclear, but it comes as embattled Sears Holdings Corp.  soared 18% after announcing an agreement to sell its signature Kenmore appliances on Amazon.com Inc. . Wall Street investors may view that agreement as a direct challenge to Home Depot and other brick-and-mortar retailers, which sell similar home-consumer products. Meanwhile, Travelers shares were lower after it reported disappointing second-quarter results. The Dow was trading off 0.1% at 21,621, after notching a record on Wednesday. Overall, the S&P 500 index  was trading 0.1% higher at 2,476, after touching a fresh intraday record at the open, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  was cooling, gaining 0.1% at 6,391, following its own climb to a fresh all-time intraday high in early Thursday trade. All of the main U.S. equity indexes closed at records on Wednesday.

Japan's exports rise for seventh straight month
              
              TOKYO--Japanese exports rose 9.7% in June from a year ago, helped by steady demand overseas for semiconductors and related equipment as well as a weaker yen. It was the seventh straight monthly gain in exports, data from Japan's Ministry of Finance showed Thursday. Exports of automobiles and steel also increased.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

opening a bank account or in other activities establishing your company, and is typically
required if seeking foreign qualification in any
other state.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
