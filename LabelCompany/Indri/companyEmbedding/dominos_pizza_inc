The delivery was fast but forgot toppings on pizza and had to come back for beverage also was very hard to understand on the phone also forgot icing for desert. Wont order again untill they are able to provide the service i expect from domonos wich i love so much

Called manager and he said he will give free breads and icing. Thanks dominos







If being the worst Domino's was a competition, look no further as you have found the world champion.

Past 3 orders arrived late, and today was the last. I ordered around 6:45PM, and after seeing the "tracker" go to being "checked for quality" and being reset 3 times I had enough. I was calling from 7:30PM since I missed a call from them, someone finally answered angrily at 8:00PM. 30 minutes to answer a freaking phone ???? I asked them to cancel my pizza, and the guy goes off on me. I ended up ordering from a local startup pizza company called Zume pizza (highly recommend), 15 minutes later viola, hot pizza at my door, and cheaper. 

Had this been only once, I understand, things happen. However, this is systematic. An hour plus if you are lucky, for a cold, soggy, poor excuse for a pizza. Toppings are few and far in between, the cheesy bready tasted like dough and was undercooked. I can literally write a book about how bad this place is and how not to run a business. bottom line, the reviews dont lie, avoid this place like the plague.







Based on the last 2 times I ordered from this store, I am NOT ordering from them again.  Their motto should be "slow, cold, and crappy".  The toppings are applied in a miserly fashion, the delivery slow as heck, and the food arrives COLD!!!!!!

The last time the food was late, I dialed the store number and it was disconnected.  I was about to order from another place when my cold crappy pizza finally arrived.  NOTE: Domino's customer service is non-existant.  "Problem?  Call the store."  Kind of hard to do when the PHONE WAS DISCONNECTED!!!!!

Failure on so many levels.  Why Domino's even gave these people a franchise escapes me.







We placed a pickup order instead of delivery. Taste was ok. Don't seem to care or understand the need for service though. Felt like bunch of buddies having good time and don't want to see any customers. Needless to say, not going back. There are so many decent pizza places. Looks else where ..







If you want your pizza to be late and cold order here, i order in advance a pizza to be delivered at 7pm on a friday i placed the order at 1pm.

7pm and nothing i called at 7:15 and no answer, i called again at 7:20 and no answer i then proceeded to the store, all the way from my house to the store i was callind and nobody answered when i arrived at the store the phone was ringing non stop and there were other 4 persons angry because their delivery never arrived, the manager seemed careless. 

All the time rhat i was there the phone just kept ringing the nobody answer, nobody apologized.

Easily one of the worst managements that i've ever experienced







This Dominos is great. Order online if you can as you can get more coupons this way.
Who was open thanksgiving day when we had nothing to eat? This place was. Handling the many others like us who had a thanksgiving food emergency like a boss. And not only that they always pay attention to my requests, if I add in to say I want them to go light on the cheese (online ordering) it will be lighter, if I say extra anything I will definitely see extra.







Haven't had Domino's since I was in college.  And, that was XX years ago!  But, my college aged daughter had a craving.  So, we ordered medium cheese and medium pepperoni pizzas.  We ordered them online and was pleasantly surprised to be able to track the progress of our order.  How cool!

The pizzas arrived in about 35 mins and were still warm.  The crust was a bit thinner than that from Pizza Hut or Mountain Mike's.  But, it had some kind of seasoning that added a good flavor.  Both were fine in terms of flavor, though none "jumped out" in terms of a memorable flavor profile.  But hey, you can't beat the cost ($5.99 each)!







Terrible service, had to stop ordering from here.  One pizza was two hours late.  Made the mistake of ordering from them again.  I ordered a pizza with no cheese.  It arrived late covered in cheese.  The delivery guy took it back and said I would get a refund.  A few minutes later the manager calls me and says that he won't give me a refund because I didn't say "No Provolone"!  He agreed that I had said no cheese, but because there were different kinds of cheese it was my fault.  Guess I should have said no provolone, no Parmesan, no Gouda, no Swiss, no cheddar, no Brie... Ridiculous.  The manager was incredibly rude.







This dominos used to be decent.  It's gone off the rails bad in the last couple years.  Burned pizzas, long wait times has been the average.  Today, we ordered pizza for delivery and the app said 30-40 mins.  That's reasonable.  Honestly, we live about 1 mile from this dominos.  Anyway, 20 mins later, the app says that my driver is on the way.  Great!  I can't believe this is going so well!  30 mins after the driver left, I call the store to make sure everything is okay.  The woman who answered had no idea what I was saying and kept repeating the same thing to me which wasn't even relevant to my inquiry.  She clearly doesn't speak english.  Okay, no problem.  I asked to speak to someone that can help me.  I'm out on hold for 15 minutes.  My pizza doesn't show up during this time either.  
I'm now at the local Drive thru because I don't know what's gone on regarding my order.  This crazy sounding man gets on the phone.  He's clearly operating outside of his ken in this restaurant.  He says, I'm sorry we didn't have your phone number right. Do you still want your pizza?  I laughed and asked if he meant the pizza that's been getting driven around for 45 mins?  He said yea.  I said no.  That's ridiculous.







This store has the absolute worst service, product, and availability of any dominos I've ever experienced . Not only is the time of order to delivery at least 1.5 hours every time, the pizza arrives cold, incorrect, and leaves a huge disappointment. When you call to inquire they give a round about answer. 

Tonight's situation went as such ... I ordered online with the $5.99 deal. One pizza, one salad. They called 40 mins after I ordered to tell me they are out of salad. I was understanding and said "no problem, I'll just have another 2 topping pizza". To which he replied "sure, that will be $15.99". I told him no way, you're out of what I ordered, you should replace it with something comparable. We talked about it for a minute and he finally agreed. 

But then...... It took 50 more mins to receive my order and it was over cooked, cold, and not tasty. I asked the delivery person what happens at his store, he shrugged and said, " I'm not really sure". I solemnly vow from this day forward to NEVER order from this dominos ever again. 

If you, reader of the dominos comments, cares at all about your reputation as a brand, please consider taking a visit and possibly shutting it down! 

Also, please do not respond with your standard BS link to make an online comment... I've already done that. I seriously cannot believe you are still in business.







The best pizza over here .. love the way crew treat the customer .. manager was so helpful in finding the deals .. highly recommend ..!! Awesome food .. awesome people ..!!







I took the time to sign up with Yelp just to write a review for the worse customer service I've ever received. I made an order at 6:45pm, it's 8:17pm am I not getting my order. I am trying to call the store for over 30 minutes and nobody answers the phone. I am very very disappointed.
Please someone from corporate contact me back







I just had the worst customer service experience at this location with a delivery. I've called the corporate office and reported. I've called my credit card to dispute the charge. The pizza was burnt and over cooked. I got some that was not buffalo chicken wings. It took 3 calls to the store to before I finally spoke with someone, who claims he was the manager on duty, and refused to help get order right. They didn't even bother to cut the pizza!!! I get stuff happens and mistakes are made, it's how you handle the mistakes that can build brand loyalty and create an awesome experience for the customer. That's business 101!







Worst customer service! Walked in asked about the promotion I had heard about online, they deal me there isn't a deal. I come home and remember that's it's the 7.99 deal and see if they can honor it despite having paid 16 dollars in the store. The manager is so rude and tells me he can't do anything. I don't care about the 8 dollars as much as I am angered by there lack of customer service and rude attitude. Also the pizza is freezing cold and rubbery.







Expect at least 1.5 hours for pizza delivery 

We got a cold pizza and an unapologetic delivery boy who left a Domino's plastic bag in our driveway (souvenir?) 

No one even bothered to pick up the phone.  TERRIBLE. SERVICE.  dominos pizza - no more!







Burnt our specialty chicken and super stingy with pizza toppings. The website said even though we couldn't see the asiago cheese on the image of the pizza when we were building it on their website, they promised to get it right. We couldn't even see it in the end.







The absolute worst service on the planet. I don't know why I keep ordering from here... NEVER AGAIN!

1) Your order will take AT LEAST 1.5 hours. Doesn't matter the time of day, traffic, etc. Plan for at least 2 hours.

2) It will arrive cold.

3) When you call in, they will tell you "your pizza is 5 minutes away - there is a bad accident"







Delicious food .. pizzas are fresh and awesome in taste .. good environment .. keep up the good work guys ..!!







What a joke! Not only rude but also unprofessional.

I called on a Sunday night to order a large pizza with a side of jalapeños...  Guess what, I couldn't order a side... I asked why and the person on the phone said they couldn't do that. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me the same thing. I started asking why and I was told because that's how it was. So I called Mountain Mike pizza and got a pizza the way I wanted it, with a side of jalapeños.







This location is an absolute nightmare. Order was late as hell, driver tries to call AFTER MIDNIGHT because he was afraid to knock. Called the store, manager tells me to f-off because my order is canceled. Holy crap. No pizza and now everything else is closed because it's so late. Screw these guys.

If being the worst Domino's was a competition, look no further as you have found the world champion.Past 3 orders arrived late, and today was the last. I ordered around 6:45PM, and after seeing the "tracker" go to being "checked for quality" and being reset 3 times I had enough. I was calling from 7:30PM since I missed a call from them, someone finally answered angrily at 8:00PM. 30 minutes to answer a freaking phone ???? I asked them to cancel my pizza, and the guy goes off on me. I ended up ordering from a local startup pizza company called Zume pizza (highly recommend), 15 minutes later viola, hot pizza at my door, and cheaper. Had this been only once, I understand, things happen. However, this is systematic. An hour plus if you are lucky, for a cold, soggy, poor excuse for a pizza. Toppings are few and far in between, the cheesy bready tasted like dough and was undercooked. I can literally write a book about how bad this place is and how not to run a business. bottom line, the reviews dont lie, avoid this place like the plague.

Based on the last 2 times I ordered from this store, I am NOT ordering from them again.  Their motto should be "slow, cold, and crappy".  The toppings are applied in a miserly fashion, the delivery slow as heck, and the food arrives COLD!!!!!!The last time the food was late, I dialed the store number and it was disconnected.  I was about to order from another place when my cold crappy pizza finally arrived.  NOTE: Domino's customer service is non-existant.  "Problem?  Call the store."  Kind of hard to do when the PHONE WAS DISCONNECTED!!!!!Failure on so many levels.  Why Domino's even gave these people a franchise escapes me.

We placed a pickup order instead of delivery. Taste was ok. Don't seem to care or understand the need for service though. Felt like bunch of buddies having good time and don't want to see any customers. Needless to say, not going back. There are so many decent pizza places. Looks else where ..

This Dominos is great. Order online if you can as you can get more coupons this way.Who was open thanksgiving day when we had nothing to eat? This place was. Handling the many others like us who had a thanksgiving food emergency like a boss. And not only that they always pay attention to my requests, if I add in to say I want them to go light on the cheese (online ordering) it will be lighter, if I say extra anything I will definitely see extra.

Haven't had Domino's since I was in college.  And, that was XX years ago!  But, my college aged daughter had a craving.  So, we ordered medium cheese and medium pepperoni pizzas.  We ordered them online and was pleasantly surprised to be able to track the progress of our order.  How cool!The pizzas arrived in about 35 mins and were still warm.  The crust was a bit thinner than that from Pizza Hut or Mountain Mike's.  But, it had some kind of seasoning that added a good flavor.  Both were fine in terms of flavor, though none "jumped out" in terms of a memorable flavor profile.  But hey, you can't beat the cost ($5.99 each)!

Terrible service, had to stop ordering from here.  One pizza was two hours late.  Made the mistake of ordering from them again.  I ordered a pizza with no cheese.  It arrived late covered in cheese.  The delivery guy took it back and said I would get a refund.  A few minutes later the manager calls me and says that he won't give me a refund because I didn't say "No Provolone"!  He agreed that I had said no cheese, but because there were different kinds of cheese it was my fault.  Guess I should have said no provolone, no Parmesan, no Gouda, no Swiss, no cheddar, no Brie... Ridiculous.  The manager was incredibly rude.

This dominos used to be decent.  It's gone off the rails bad in the last couple years.  Burned pizzas, long wait times has been the average.  Today, we ordered pizza for delivery and the app said 30-40 mins.  That's reasonable.  Honestly, we live about 1 mile from this dominos.  Anyway, 20 mins later, the app says that my driver is on the way.  Great!  I can't believe this is going so well!  30 mins after the driver left, I call the store to make sure everything is okay.  The woman who answered had no idea what I was saying and kept repeating the same thing to me which wasn't even relevant to my inquiry.  She clearly doesn't speak english.  Okay, no problem.  I asked to speak to someone that can help me.  I'm out on hold for 15 minutes.  My pizza doesn't show up during this time either.  I'm now at the local Drive thru because I don't know what's gone on regarding my order.  This crazy sounding man gets on the phone.  He's clearly operating outside of his ken in this restaurant.  He says, I'm sorry we didn't have your phone number right. Do you still want your pizza?  I laughed and asked if he meant the pizza that's been getting driven around for 45 mins?  He said yea.  I said no.  That's ridiculous.

This store has the absolute worst service, product, and availability of any dominos I've ever experienced . Not only is the time of order to delivery at least 1.5 hours every time, the pizza arrives cold, incorrect, and leaves a huge disappointment. When you call to inquire they give a round about answer. Tonight's situation went as such ... I ordered online with the $5.99 deal. One pizza, one salad. They called 40 mins after I ordered to tell me they are out of salad. I was understanding and said "no problem, I'll just have another 2 topping pizza". To which he replied "sure, that will be $15.99". I told him no way, you're out of what I ordered, you should replace it with something comparable. We talked about it for a minute and he finally agreed. But then...... It took 50 more mins to receive my order and it was over cooked, cold, and not tasty. I asked the delivery person what happens at his store, he shrugged and said, " I'm not really sure". I solemnly vow from this day forward to NEVER order from this dominos ever again. If you, reader of the dominos comments, cares at all about your reputation as a brand, please consider taking a visit and possibly shutting it down! Also, please do not respond with your standard BS link to make an online comment... I've already done that. I seriously cannot believe you are still in business.

I just had the worst customer service experience at this location with a delivery. I've called the corporate office and reported. I've called my credit card to dispute the charge. The pizza was burnt and over cooked. I got some that was not buffalo chicken wings. It took 3 calls to the store to before I finally spoke with someone, who claims he was the manager on duty, and refused to help get order right. They didn't even bother to cut the pizza!!! I get stuff happens and mistakes are made, it's how you handle the mistakes that can build brand loyalty and create an awesome experience for the customer. That's business 101!








Where's the chicken wings.

Worst customer service! Walked in asked about the promotion I had heard about online, they deal me there isn't a deal. I come home and remember that's it's the 7.99 deal and see if they can honor it despite having paid 16 dollars in the store. The manager is so rude and tells me he can't do anything. I don't care about the 8 dollars as much as I am angered by there lack of customer service and rude attitude. Also the pizza is freezing cold and rubbery.

Burnt our specialty chicken and super stingy with pizza toppings. The website said even though we couldn't see the asiago cheese on the image of the pizza when we were building it on their website, they promised to get it right. We couldn't even see it in the end.

The absolute worst service on the planet. I don't know why I keep ordering from here... NEVER AGAIN!1) Your order will take AT LEAST 1.5 hours. Doesn't matter the time of day, traffic, etc. Plan for at least 2 hours.2) It will arrive cold.3) When you call in, they will tell you "your pizza is 5 minutes away - there is a bad accident"

What a joke! Not only rude but also unprofessional.I called on a Sunday night to order a large pizza with a side of jalapeños...  Guess what, I couldn't order a side... I asked why and the person on the phone said they couldn't do that. I asked to speak to a manager and he told me the same thing. I started asking why and I was told because that's how it was. So I called Mountain Mike pizza and got a pizza the way I wanted it, with a side of jalapeños.

This location is an absolute nightmare. Order was late as hell, driver tries to call AFTER MIDNIGHT because he was afraid to knock. Called the store, manager tells me to f-off because my order is canceled. Holy crap. No pizza and now everything else is closed because it's so late. Screw these guys.

I love pizza and they have variety of vegetarian options. Always get freshly prepared within 15 minutes.







Typical Domino's pizza.  
So-so quality, slow as hell, unhelpful staff.  

No prices posted!

Just REALLY DISAPPOINTED that their delivery driver parks in the handicapped parking space, when he has two perfectly good legs to walk with.

TERRIBLE PR.







Most horrible experience ever! Ordered via the app for pick up. When arriving after being notified my order is ready for pickup. The employee was in the phone with another customer he did not even recognize me or apologize for making me have to wait,he just left me standing. After three minutes he paused the call and asked what I wanted. Told him my name and asked if my order was ready. He said two minutes and went straightback to the phone. After two minutes a politely asked if there was any progress. He than put the phone on hold again now having two angry customers. He went back and talked to another guy. Looked around on shelves. And than said. We have not done your order yet can you wait five to ten minutes? 

Luckily I whose pay at pickup and not in the app so I walked out and went to another place. This is Restaurang is absolutely catastrophic!







DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. 
I'm blown away. I order here 4 times a week. Well, kiss that goodbye. Let me explain why...
I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING...
- Hair in my pizza.
- The sketchiest and most inconsiderate 'delivery' men. 
- Pizza that states on its way...arriving 45-1hr 20 min later. 
- The 'kids' that deliver, always expecting tips. 
- Management not believing me. 
- CC 'declining' - when the newbies attempt a transaction. 
- Delivery of food mishandled. 
- Wings and breads always hard or cold. 
- Never knowing what to expect. 

Now, if I were to show receipt of my transactions for proof, most would be blown away. I am appalled. I'm done. I'm absolutely positive this is the sole reason why there are horrible reviews and always a new person working. =[ 

The Owner (I won't name names) put the blame on ME in regards to something and that was the straw on the camel's back. I always provide good feedback and tip but I'm looked at like a scum when I needed help. Here's to all my money wasted and mouth being kept shut. I never thought this would happen. Please TAKE ACTION AND CLEAN UP THIS RESTAURANT's 'LONG TERM' ISSUES!! Next step? BBB.







My long history of ordering through this store has come to an end!  They accidentally delivered the wrong pizza a few orders ago...accidents happen, I get it.  When I brought it to their attention they agreed to deliver the proper pizza the next time I placed an order.  Well, today I called to get the pizza and a sandwich.  I expected to pay for the sandwich, but an added delivery fee of $3.99....really?!  They are coming here to give me the pizza that I paid for...including delivery!  Howard (manager) was so rude.  I could hear him yelling that I have to pay for delivery....even though I already PAID for delivery of a pizza that they owe me!







Got there early to take out a couple pizza's. While waiting we watched one
of the food preparers take a walk in order. He did the money exchange, then 
returned to making a pizza without washing his hands. A minute or so later the 
delivery person came in the front door, put his bag down and proceeded to cut
our pizza's and box them. Again, this guy didn't wash his hands either. Even after
just arriving from somewhere outside. There's a Domino's down ElCamino in
Mtn. View a short distance away. Next time I decide to get Domino's, I'll go there
instead.







Thanks for the late night pizza! Walking distance to the Grand Hotel where we stayed. Best drunk food :) and cheap! Oscar and his co worker were very friendly and made our pizzas very quick! 10 mins!







Last time I order pizza from this place...two times I've called for a pizza and they take an hour when I call to ask about the pizzas they always say it hasn't been an hour when clearly on my phone it says an hour...the workers are rude







The worst dominos experience globally.. Rude staff 0 stars badly treat customers..

Suggest people to go to other outlets close by.. There is another dominos very close please go there..







Tasty pizza, fast preparation, and most items are inexpensive. 

This Domino's Pizza location is my second favorite pizza place in Sunnyvale (for big pizza chains only; ie. Round Table, Domino's, Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, etc.). I've been coming here for years and have only had one negative experience which was rectified the same day.

The pizza ingredients are fairly good; not the best, but definitely not cheap tasting. In my opinion, the star of every pizza I order from this location is always the crust, which is always buttery and garlicky.

Since the pizza from this location is usually good and the prices can't be beat, I'll of course come back in the future. As a side note, my favorite pizza deal from this location is $7.99 for a large 3-topping pizza, Monday through Thursday.







They don't give out the deals as advertised. The $7.99 large pizza deal with 3 toppings will cost $1.75 more if you choose chicken as the topping coz "supposedly chicken is a premium topping". Never going back again.

1 star as there's no option for 0 star. There are other dominoes in El Camino which are better than this one.







If I could give them no stars I would!! 

Called in an order last night for delivery, when my family and I started to eat the pizza. I noticed hair in the melted cheese!! I called dominos and told them about hair in the pizza and the person who answered the phone was very rude and said there was nothing the can do about the hair in the pizza. I asked to speak with a manager and he replied "I am the manager".

I told him if there's nothing you can do then I'll just have to contact corporate. Then he replied "go ahead and call corporate, I know where you live!!" 

He shouldnt be a manager with this attitude and he also shouldn't be threatening his customers like that!! This is the last time I'm ordering from dominos!!







I would give ZERO STARS if I could. I have been a customer of this store for more than a decade. I have NEVER been so poorly treated. 

I ordered a pizza at 8:41. The tracker said that Mohammed left the store with my order at 8:54. I called the store at 9:28 to see where it was, as I live less than 5 minutes from the store. I was told that it was on the way. The store person said to have the driver call when he arrived, but when he arrived (at 9:33) he had no phone; I gave him mine as I thought I was still on the line with the store, but the store had hung up. I called again and got a different person who said 40 minutes was normal for delivery and he could do nothing. EXTREMELY unhappy, I paid and took the pizza inside. Opened it up and found it was cold. Called the store again and the same man said too bad, there was nothing he could do. This was NOT decent customer service, and Dominos should be ashamed (and the manager disciplined).







I've been ordering pizza from you guys for 4 years. It takes us longer to decide what we want then it does for you to get here! They don't skimp on or custom sausage, garlic white sauce, roasted red pepper, spinach, double garlic always pan style slice of heaven. Always in our hearts...Hollenbeck.







Horrible. I am literally a five minute drive away from this place. I don't have a car, or else I'd go elsewhere... the website showed my delivery left at 11:20. It's now 12:08, and it isn't here. And it says it was delivered 20 minutes ago. I called and all the lady said was "it's on it's way, it left." Freaking awul! UPDATE:  it just NOW arrived, almost an hour after the driver left...it's cold, dry, and there are EYEBROW HAIRS IN IT. With the roots visible and eveything... so I can't even eat it. I called and told the worker who answered and she kept saying "no, it isn't hair, it's oregano." Oregano does NOT look like brown eyebrow hair. And she didn't see it herself, so how can she say it isn't what it is, arguing with the customer?  And now I have to go to school hungry and angry. This place needs to be closed. DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE!!!







As bad as advertised. Took them more than 30mins just to deliver the pizza. Then delivery kid tries to tell me the order tracker isn't accurate and that he came straight over from the store (5mins down the street). Kid lied, pizza didn't - it was lukewarm. Shame...







It would be great if they kept their pizza for pickup in a warm oven instead of on a cold rack.  (they do seem to have a heat lamp, so it keeps the box top warm!  LOL!)







Most of the Domino's I have used are great. Fast and service is decent. This one has been the same a while back. Now the past couple orders have taken over and hr and half and the pizza is cold. The driver spoke no english and could not give me an explanation and the manager at the store kept telling me the driver was almost there. I live less than ten minutes from the store! 

After writing to corporate I get a response from the manager saying I can have a free medium pizza. 

First: My original order I wrote about was a Large with a side w/ delivery. 

My response was ok...some compensation is better than none. Told me it was linked to my phone number.

I call in to redeem my free medium pizza and get a response of this is only for pickup. 

WOW....this clarification was not given when I was offered the free pizza for the issue otherwise I would have said no thank you and asked for a refund on my original order and you can pick up the old pizza. 

No help at this location. Either management or ownership change has turned them downhill and corporate isn't much help aside from sending it on the ownership.







Honestly this was the best order from Dominoes my fiance and I have ever had.

 We ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta, the chicken habenero sandwich, and a 14 piece hot wings, requesting extra crispy ( run thru the oven 3x, so amazing!)

Not only was the order super hot, but we could tell the ingredients were fresh and the chicken wings were the best we've both had. They were juicy, but just crisp enough on the outside. The pasta and sandwich were both equally as great.

We are from San Diego and have ordered from Dominoes countless times from many locations over the years. It's usually between disappointing and pretty darn good. This time, it was the best. 

Whatever you guys did tonight, do it again. It was great. Thank you for a suprisingly good meal!







This was my goto place for years until they recently changed management.  So I had to change my review.  The new management is very stingy.  Barely any toppings and only 1 package of Parmigiana Cheese for a large pizza. When I called to complain they didn't seem to care.  I DO NOT recommend this Domino location.

They don't give out the deals as advertised. The $7.99 large pizza deal with 3 toppings will cost $1.75 more if you choose chicken as the topping coz "supposedly chicken is a premium topping". Never going back again.1 star as there's no option for 0 star. There are other dominoes in El Camino which are better than this one.

If I could give them no stars I would!! Called in an order last night for delivery, when my family and I started to eat the pizza. I noticed hair in the melted cheese!! I called dominos and told them about hair in the pizza and the person who answered the phone was very rude and said there was nothing the can do about the hair in the pizza. I asked to speak with a manager and he replied "I am the manager".I told him if there's nothing you can do then I'll just have to contact corporate. Then he replied "go ahead and call corporate, I know where you live!!" He shouldnt be a manager with this attitude and he also shouldn't be threatening his customers like that!! This is the last time I'm ordering from dominos!!

I would give ZERO STARS if I could. I have been a customer of this store for more than a decade. I have NEVER been so poorly treated. I ordered a pizza at 8:41. The tracker said that Mohammed left the store with my order at 8:54. I called the store at 9:28 to see where it was, as I live less than 5 minutes from the store. I was told that it was on the way. The store person said to have the driver call when he arrived, but when he arrived (at 9:33) he had no phone; I gave him mine as I thought I was still on the line with the store, but the store had hung up. I called again and got a different person who said 40 minutes was normal for delivery and he could do nothing. EXTREMELY unhappy, I paid and took the pizza inside. Opened it up and found it was cold. Called the store again and the same man said too bad, there was nothing he could do. This was NOT decent customer service, and Dominos should be ashamed (and the manager disciplined).

I've been ordering pizza from you guys for 4 years. It takes us longer to decide what we want then it does for you to get here! They don't skimp on or custom sausage, garlic white sauce, roasted red pepper, spinach, double garlic always pan style slice of heaven. Always in our hearts...Hollenbeck.

Horrible. I am literally a five minute drive away from this place. I don't have a car, or else I'd go elsewhere... the website showed my delivery left at 11:20. It's now 12:08, and it isn't here. And it says it was delivered 20 minutes ago. I called and all the lady said was "it's on it's way, it left." Freaking awul! UPDATE:  it just NOW arrived, almost an hour after the driver left...it's cold, dry, and there are EYEBROW HAIRS IN IT. With the roots visible and eveything... so I can't even eat it. I called and told the worker who answered and she kept saying "no, it isn't hair, it's oregano." Oregano does NOT look like brown eyebrow hair. And she didn't see it herself, so how can she say it isn't what it is, arguing with the customer?  And now I have to go to school hungry and angry. This place needs to be closed. DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE!!!

As bad as advertised. Took them more than 30mins just to deliver the pizza. Then delivery kid tries to tell me the order tracker isn't accurate and that he came straight over from the store (5mins down the street). Kid lied, pizza didn't - it was lukewarm. Shame...

It would be great if they kept their pizza for pickup in a warm oven instead of on a cold rack.  (they do seem to have a heat lamp, so it keeps the box top warm!  LOL!)

Most of the Domino's I have used are great. Fast and service is decent. This one has been the same a while back. Now the past couple orders have taken over and hr and half and the pizza is cold. The driver spoke no english and could not give me an explanation and the manager at the store kept telling me the driver was almost there. I live less than ten minutes from the store! After writing to corporate I get a response from the manager saying I can have a free medium pizza. First: My original order I wrote about was a Large with a side w/ delivery. My response was ok...some compensation is better than none. Told me it was linked to my phone number.I call in to redeem my free medium pizza and get a response of this is only for pickup. WOW....this clarification was not given when I was offered the free pizza for the issue otherwise I would have said no thank you and asked for a refund on my original order and you can pick up the old pizza. No help at this location. Either management or ownership change has turned them downhill and corporate isn't much help aside from sending it on the ownership.

Honestly this was the best order from Dominoes my fiance and I have ever had. We ordered the chicken Alfredo pasta, the chicken habenero sandwich, and a 14 piece hot wings, requesting extra crispy ( run thru the oven 3x, so amazing!)Not only was the order super hot, but we could tell the ingredients were fresh and the chicken wings were the best we've both had. They were juicy, but just crisp enough on the outside. The pasta and sandwich were both equally as great.We are from San Diego and have ordered from Dominoes countless times from many locations over the years. It's usually between disappointing and pretty darn good. This time, it was the best. Whatever you guys did tonight, do it again. It was great. Thank you for a suprisingly good meal!

This was my goto place for years until they recently changed management.  So I had to change my review.  The new management is very stingy.  Barely any toppings and only 1 package of Parmigiana Cheese for a large pizza. When I called to complain they didn't seem to care.  I DO NOT recommend this Domino location.

So far I've ordered from here three times. It's okay, typical service. First time the pizza was good service was decent. Second time I placed the order online. I received no confirmation call. When I called them my pizza was ready for pickup. Third time I called while in route. A lady answered the phone and asked if I could hold. I made the six minute drive, parked, ordered (saw who I think was her making pizza on arrival), went back to my car and still no one had answered the phone for almost 10 minutes. Overall the people are polite and the pizza is good. They could do a little better though.







Not sure why all the negative reviews yes there has been diffrent employees over the past few months but they really aint that bad i always order on the phone when im in the area and want a fresh hot pizza and they answer super quick my order is also always done in less than 20 minutes overall a good place staff are courteous and friendly the only downside is the lack of having a table in case you want to eat in there but the location is small pizza is always done right in my expirence.







My coworker and I ordered the CHICKEN BACON RANCH hot sandwich and it had hardly any meat!
We also ordered a pizza with Italian sausage, onions and mushrooms....also barley any toppings and the dough was gummy. 
What a sad lunch.......disappointed and will not be reordering from this location.







I used to love dominos. I always wondered why they had such a poor reputation as their pizza is decent and reasonably cheap. However, I now realize that all the hate they get is very well-deserved. They have some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. I have lost all respect for domino's workers and the company as a whole. 

I've never written a yelp review before, but I was compelled to simply because of my recent experience with this domino's location.  I ordered two pizza's around midnight on memorial day. I paid online with my card. I was up all night waiting for my pizzas and THEY NEVER CAME. When I initially ordered online their website said the pizzas would be delivered in 40-61 minutes. By 2am I had yet to hear from them. According to their pizza tracker (which would be great if it worked - but it doesn't and is completely annoying retarded bullshit) they only put the pizza in the oven around 3am. Later, around 3:40 am, the tracker said the pizza had been delivered. I went outside, and called the store and delivery person multiple times to see what had happened. As usual, no response. They never bothered to even contact me to telly my pizzas were not coming. 

I paid for my pizzas and they never came. I can't believe it. DOMINOS IS RUN BY A BUNCH OF DECEITFUL INCOMPETENT FUCKERS FUCK FUCK. 

THEY CHOKED MORE THAN THE CHOKELAHOMA CITY THUNDER DOMINOS CAN SUCK MY DICK.







So  we ordered our pizza and when it got here the goods were missing.Meat!!! Called in and Tim was very polite and apologize.I guess there was a miss understanding between the baker and the delivery guy.Delivery guy comes back and brings us a new pizza and apologize as well.These guys work hard and aim to please.Thank you guys!This Dominos team rock!







People working at this location have zero sense of customer responsibility. I called them up twice. On first call they placed me on hold, the second I called for around 5 mins. I thought they forgot about my phone call so, I called them up again. They put me on hold again the moment I call up. This time they put me on infinite hold. The elapsed time on my call kept increasing. Every second made me more infuriated and increased my curiosity as to what the heck is going on. I had enough - picked up the car and drove to the location. When I entered the location I was flabbergasted to witness that they paid no heed to whoever called and just paid them on infinite hold and never took their order. This is blasphemy! My call was still going on. I showed the employee responsible for the location at that time my call status - it should elapsed time over 30 mins. She says "sorry, we are busy." I told her why didn't you tell me that over the phone? She said "oh, I am sorry."  While I was there somebody called up and she did the same thing, "hi, can you please hold?" I told her "what exactly are you doing??," tell the person that you can't take his order it's not gay hard. But she didn't. I took a screen shot Of my call when it hit 30
Mins mark. I am post it here.
I asked the manager what's your name and she became defensive and even more rude. She told me her nAme is "Mary." I don't think she gave  me her right name. 
Dominos: can somebody reach out and give me an explanation on this?







Ordered pizza from here for delivery...they gave us zero plates n no cheese n Pepper dumbasses







I gave $2 in cash as gratuity for a simple order (#306953) on 01/22/2017. Now having found out someone in Domino's employ has committed forgery against the credit card receipt of that order, I'm no longer feeling grateful. If Domino's would refund said $2, that would be great.







I had only thrown up once in my life (first time drinking) before I ordered the Hawaiian pizza from Domino's. Almost immediately, I vomited three times every hour and a half for 12 hours! Sometimes the gagging would only bring up one piece of ham or pineapple (sorry). My body did not want any of it in my system!!!







Get this. I ordered a pizza on Friday night. I was told it would take 60 minutes to deliver. After waiting for over 2 hours I gave up. The pizza never came that night. The next day I noticed that I was charged on my credit card. I called Dominos to get the charge reversed. The lady said she could not do it and offered me store credit which I did not want. She promised me a call back which never came. Today I called them and asked about my refund and the lady flat out hung up on me. I am in shock. Stay far far away from this joke of a place







Ordered 6days ahead, scheduled for 11 am. Pizza doesn't arrive until 11:30. Worst of all, I called and the manager was like, "I guess someone changed it" when she was the one who took order! Don't recommend this location!!!!!!







Worst experience ever! After waiting over an hour from when they said our order was on its way. We called to inquire about where it was and were repeatedly hung up on by multiple employees. Left with no answers and our order never being delivered. To the supposed manager david your employees should be fired for the way they treat your now former customers.







If you like mediocre pizza served with an attitude, this is the place for you! The woman at the front tried to argue with my coworker about a sauce  that she ordered and they didn't put in. The past 3 times I have been there, customer service has been an issue. There needs to be a customer service class taught to this location, it's getting ridiculous now.







Worst f**** place I am east Palo Alto and I spoke to a lady that speaks Spanish and no f** delivery! Call one more time as soon as I checked map to se how long it takes 5 mins where I live that all it takes!!! And when I called lady says no deliveries in palo alto an then hangs up phone!! Trying to make business like that no..... Please don't work if this how people are going to be treated never eating from this or order from this place







The pizza from here is great. They aren't stingy with the toppings. When I order light sauce they actually put light sauce (super important to me!).

The only complaint I have is when I pick up the pizza, the employees usually take a while to attend me. They might even look at me, but continue what they're doing. I get it though, they're busy. At least no one has been rude to me.







Back home in Hawaii I almost never go to Dominoes because I don't care for their pizza. But I've ordered delivery from this location twice in the past three days. Their pizza was seriously the best Dominoes I've ever tasted in my life. I ordered only 2 toppings and the pizza was covered perfectly with it. The Parmesan bread bites & hot wings were actually good too! Will definitely order from here again should the need arise.







Just wanted to give a quick shout because I was nervous to order online from this delivery location with all the negative reviews, but the experience couldn't have been better. I ordered at 2:30 pm on a Friday. The order was perfect and arrived within 40 minutes. Maybe things at this location are turning around :-)







The WORST Customer Service I have ever received. My order was messed up and I waited for a new pizza for over 2 hours but never received one. When I reached out to the store, I was put on hold and the call was cut immediately. It happened 4 times and when I asked the woman not to put me on hold, I was yelled at. Plus I was told that i would not get reimbursed for all the extra money i paid for my toppings but didn't receive. This is not the first time this has happened with this store. 
Their sense of accountability is abysmal. When asked to talk to the manager, she got defensive and replied that she was the manager. Plus I was told, good luck with taking any actions against the store or her.
Never Had such a terrible experience with any store. Given that it is in Palo Alto, i expected better service.







Don't order online!! We waited two hours for our pizza delivery and the order was incorrect! We will not order at this location anymore!







Wow. Made simple order online. After 25 min getting phone from a driver who doesn't speak much English mumbles that he cannot find the address and he gives up. Yup. Calling the store, the "manager" tells me to call back to the driver because it is not his problem now. Huh??  Yeah. Ok. This is probably the most dysfunctional Domino's location I have ever encountered.  Wouldn't order again from this place.

I used to love dominos. I always wondered why they had such a poor reputation as their pizza is decent and reasonably cheap. However, I now realize that all the hate they get is very well-deserved. They have some of the worst customer service I have ever seen. I have lost all respect for domino's workers and the company as a whole. I've never written a yelp review before, but I was compelled to simply because of my recent experience with this domino's location.  I ordered two pizza's around midnight on memorial day. I paid online with my card. I was up all night waiting for my pizzas and THEY NEVER CAME. When I initially ordered online their website said the pizzas would be delivered in 40-61 minutes. By 2am I had yet to hear from them. According to their pizza tracker (which would be great if it worked - but it doesn't and is completely annoying retarded bullshit) they only put the pizza in the oven around 3am. Later, around 3:40 am, the tracker said the pizza had been delivered. I went outside, and called the store and delivery person multiple times to see what had happened. As usual, no response. They never bothered to even contact me to telly my pizzas were not coming. I paid for my pizzas and they never came. I can't believe it. DOMINOS IS RUN BY A BUNCH OF DECEITFUL INCOMPETENT FUCKERS FUCK FUCK. THEY CHOKED MORE THAN THE CHOKELAHOMA CITY THUNDER DOMINOS CAN SUCK MY DICK.

People working at this location have zero sense of customer responsibility. I called them up twice. On first call they placed me on hold, the second I called for around 5 mins. I thought they forgot about my phone call so, I called them up again. They put me on hold again the moment I call up. This time they put me on infinite hold. The elapsed time on my call kept increasing. Every second made me more infuriated and increased my curiosity as to what the heck is going on. I had enough - picked up the car and drove to the location. When I entered the location I was flabbergasted to witness that they paid no heed to whoever called and just paid them on infinite hold and never took their order. This is blasphemy! My call was still going on. I showed the employee responsible for the location at that time my call status - it should elapsed time over 30 mins. She says "sorry, we are busy." I told her why didn't you tell me that over the phone? She said "oh, I am sorry."  While I was there somebody called up and she did the same thing, "hi, can you please hold?" I told her "what exactly are you doing??," tell the person that you can't take his order it's not gay hard. But she didn't. I took a screen shot Of my call when it hit 30Mins mark. I am post it here.I asked the manager what's your name and she became defensive and even more rude. She told me her nAme is "Mary." I don't think she gave  me her right name. Dominos: can somebody reach out and give me an explanation on this?








Here is the screenshot of my call, where I was put on hold for 30 mins

I gave $2 in cash as gratuity for a simple order (#306953) on 01/22/2017. Now having found out someone in Domino's employ has committed forgery against the credit card receipt of that order, I'm no longer feeling grateful. If Domino's would refund said $2, that would be great.

I had only thrown up once in my life (first time drinking) before I ordered the Hawaiian pizza from Domino's. Almost immediately, I vomited three times every hour and a half for 12 hours! Sometimes the gagging would only bring up one piece of ham or pineapple (sorry). My body did not want any of it in my system!!!

Get this. I ordered a pizza on Friday night. I was told it would take 60 minutes to deliver. After waiting for over 2 hours I gave up. The pizza never came that night. The next day I noticed that I was charged on my credit card. I called Dominos to get the charge reversed. The lady said she could not do it and offered me store credit which I did not want. She promised me a call back which never came. Today I called them and asked about my refund and the lady flat out hung up on me. I am in shock. Stay far far away from this joke of a place

Worst experience ever! After waiting over an hour from when they said our order was on its way. We called to inquire about where it was and were repeatedly hung up on by multiple employees. Left with no answers and our order never being delivered. To the supposed manager david your employees should be fired for the way they treat your now former customers.

If you like mediocre pizza served with an attitude, this is the place for you! The woman at the front tried to argue with my coworker about a sauce  that she ordered and they didn't put in. The past 3 times I have been there, customer service has been an issue. There needs to be a customer service class taught to this location, it's getting ridiculous now.

The pizza from here is great. They aren't stingy with the toppings. When I order light sauce they actually put light sauce (super important to me!).The only complaint I have is when I pick up the pizza, the employees usually take a while to attend me. They might even look at me, but continue what they're doing. I get it though, they're busy. At least no one has been rude to me.

Back home in Hawaii I almost never go to Dominoes because I don't care for their pizza. But I've ordered delivery from this location twice in the past three days. Their pizza was seriously the best Dominoes I've ever tasted in my life. I ordered only 2 toppings and the pizza was covered perfectly with it. The Parmesan bread bites & hot wings were actually good too! Will definitely order from here again should the need arise.

Just wanted to give a quick shout because I was nervous to order online from this delivery location with all the negative reviews, but the experience couldn't have been better. I ordered at 2:30 pm on a Friday. The order was perfect and arrived within 40 minutes. Maybe things at this location are turning around :-)

The WORST Customer Service I have ever received. My order was messed up and I waited for a new pizza for over 2 hours but never received one. When I reached out to the store, I was put on hold and the call was cut immediately. It happened 4 times and when I asked the woman not to put me on hold, I was yelled at. Plus I was told that i would not get reimbursed for all the extra money i paid for my toppings but didn't receive. This is not the first time this has happened with this store. Their sense of accountability is abysmal. When asked to talk to the manager, she got defensive and replied that she was the manager. Plus I was told, good luck with taking any actions against the store or her.Never Had such a terrible experience with any store. Given that it is in Palo Alto, i expected better service.

Wow. Made simple order online. After 25 min getting phone from a driver who doesn't speak much English mumbles that he cannot find the address and he gives up. Yup. Calling the store, the "manager" tells me to call back to the driver because it is not his problem now. Huh??  Yeah. Ok. This is probably the most dysfunctional Domino's location I have ever encountered.  Wouldn't order again from this place.

Guy made a suggestion which helped me save money.  Thank you!!!  The phone service is okay.  No enthusiasm but it's okay, it's the Bay Area we talk to millions of people everyday.

It took 45-50 minutes pretty much the quoted time he said for the pizza to get her during the dinner rush.  It was good pizza!  $19.99 out the door for a large pizza with delivery.  The 7.99 deal is take out only.  I usually pick up but the wonderful thing about pizza is ever night is pizza night or can be and it can be delivered if needed and I was in a hurry.

They didn't my cell to let me know he was here but that's okay.  It was hot and delicious and alittle doughy but very good and the chicken slices on the pizza were pretty good not very tiny like some places.  I would suggest to everyone to save money, go their in person or order online but the fastest way is to order over the phone and for delivery. . Thank you for making my dinner.

A lot of the "in house" experiences are true on Yelp too.







So I'm not usually one to give a place such a poor rating but multiple times now I have ordered something and it came incorrect, undercooked, or overlooked.

I've always picked up a pizza and over heard the manager at the time yelling very rude things to his employee and he challenged me to fight. He did not want it. 

The reason I'm writing this review today is because I thought I made mistake last when ordering online but after reviewing my last order on their app they did in fact forget the tomatoes. Not to mention when the delivery driver arrived he complained about the tip and asked for more. He forgot my napkins and shook his head when I gave him another dollar.

Very unethical and very rude. 

Giving them one last chance tonight.







Horrible Horrible Experience with Dominos...Never again ordering  ever...

We made an online order at 12 20 and waiter for an hour and there was no pizza, so when i called back they inform me that there was a new driver and he was at the apartment but did not know which building it was and tried to contact but it was a old number on my profile and hence could not reach me... I mean come on, you can ask the leasing office or anyone around, its not that difficult...

So they promised to send it back again in 15 mins, i waited another half an hour and still nothing

So i called again, and this time they state, its on the way and will be there in 2 mins

I wait for 15 more mins and still nothing

This was for the kids and the order was place at 12 20 and now its 2 PM, i mean this is heights of dominos attitude

So i call them again, and tell them, you cannot be this late and even if you deliver, it will be a cold pizza and and i will not need it, he drops the calls so rudely...this is horrible horrible service 

I do not know if they will cancel the order and refund me 

Please improve you customer experience otherwise there will not be people ordering from your store ever again







Worst service ever,  #1 I called to order a pizza and the guy wouldn't give me online prices, said I had to order online. He actually yelled at me, said..."That's what I said Maam!" Okay, I did that. I brought my pizza home and was so hungry and excited but when I bit into my pizza and it was horrible,  no garlic cream sauce, no flavor, I ordered extra red sauce on tbe other,  no flavors just bad all together. Tasted like tomato paste on bread. I called to tell the guy and he argued with me and then said he would get his manager for me, instead...HE HUNG UP ON ME! 
Sorry, never again... I'm so disappointed,  I went to Dominoes because the commercials claim they use fresh products, I could have bought a better frozen pizza.







Live in the neighborhood and have never had a bad experience with this Domino's. They're always on time and have never messed up an order (aside from the occasional missing dipping sauce!) so I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are from. The pizza has gotten a lot better in recent years and I'm always happy to order it!







Dumbass employees do not know what they're doing. 
Every time I order from here they always act like they have no clue what they're doing on the phone. They also took an hour & 20 minutes to deliver a medium pizza. Wow lmfao







They are known for delivery, in the past its been pretty good. This time, the driver left without my pizza, the application showed my pizza was delivered. Driver called me to give me the bad news, called the store, they had no idea, so I'm guessing the pizza was delivered to the wrong address. Manager offered a free pizza. Called 45 minutes later, and they had not even started making the pizza. Manager put my pizza at the back of the bus.
Don't use these guys, they will lose your pizza. Had to cancel the order.







If you download the app, you can order a medium 2-topping pizza for around $6. I usually get the pan crust with white sauce, and it lasts me a couple days' worth of meals. 

I will say that, even though they're gracious with the cheese, they skimp on the toppings. But it's fast, cheap, nearby, and the employees are always friendly. 

And in spite of my preference for small businesses over franchises, it's a nice indulgence every so often.







I'm not trying to be contrary here, but everyone one with the 1-star reviews on this location are just mad about the terrible delivery service. The pizza itself is...Dominos..no surprises there. I agree, DON'T order delivery from here if you are expecting a timely delivery...but if you treat this place as a PICK-UP ONLY location I think you will be well served. Call in, give them your order and they get it done quickly. Even on the busiest Friday the most I had to wait for pick up was 30 minutes. Usually they have it ready in less than 10 min. The people who work here are really nice folks tryin to make an honest living, and the food quality is fine! Plus, it's cheap.







Worst chicken pizza ever...chicken pieces was hard and raw and looks like way way old.







Haters gonna hate but this location has delivered nothing but excellence!  Loyal like family, they have given me great delivery and delicious pizza!  That's all. Love you guys!







Put in an order for a party, and requested square cut slices (Domino's website allows this in its online order system). However, when I got the pizzas, the slices were radial. Instead of offering a replacement for this, the associate just wanted me to take the cut pizza's as is.







Will never use the Sunnyvale, Caliente St. location again. Driver was polite, but pizza arrived 1 hr and 18 minutes after order. (quoted 27-37 min) Your online dominos tracker said that the pizza had been delivered 35 minutes before it actually was. I tried to call the location and was hung up on twice after being put into queue, never being talked to. Stay away pizza people!







This review is solely based on their delivery service.

My boyfriend and I ordered pizza online. We noticed it was taking longer than usual for the pizza to get to the door so we checked the status online. The status said the pizza was out the door at 6:42 pm. Fast forward an hour later, and we have still yet to get our pizza. I understand that maybe the driver is making multiple deliveries, and maybe our house isn't the first house to get delivered to, but it should not take more than an hour to get here. The pizza is already going to be cold by the time they get here. I called the store to check the status of the order and the manager, Ana, kept making up excuses as to why the delivery is late. "Oh sorry, we're a bit understaffed today. Two drivers called off." I understand stuff like this happens, but when I asked why the status online says it was already out the door, she said "We were really busy and just had to push out all these orders. But the driver left 3 minutes ago." Huh? That doesn't make sense. So they just update the status without it being true. I would have rather them leaving the order as is, knowing that my order wasn't made yet, versus them lying saying it left the store and me wondering why is it taking forever?

All in all, take your money elsewhere. The delivery service sucks. Making you pay a delivery fee when they're not even on time. NOT GOING TO ORDER FROM DOMINOES EVER AGAIN. 

Update: As I was writing this review, the delivery guy finally came. As expected, the food was already cold. I lost my appetite. The driver didn't even apologize for taking a long time (90 minutes!) to get here. Like I said, just take your money elsewhere.







Just went to this location to pick up an order . Walked inside and there were two employees at the counter (one on the phone). I wasn't greeted by either of them. After about 30 seconds I say I have a pick up , with my name . The guy starts to scramble around looking for my order , asking what it was . After the guy who I assume is the manager gets off the phone (an older Asian gentleman) he hangs up and starts yelling "SHIT ! Lady is laughing at me! YOU CAN EAT AND ORDER OR NOT ! I don't give a shit!!" And walks away as his other employees laugh (still scrambling to find my order ). I work in customer service and if I were to talk like that in front of customers , I'd definitely be fired .they continued to laugh as the guy placed my salad in a bag and dropped it on the counter and walked away . I wasn't told thank you by any three employees . Completely unprofessional location , will not be going back here and I live 1 minute down the street . Would rather spend my time driving to Round Table .







They don't ever pick up the phone!!!! I been ordering from this store for a while and the pizza is been quite alright and I always tip good. The costumer service sucks big time when it comes to calling. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with jalapeños and when I open my pizza obviously starving, I only see jalapeños. That of course really upset me since I was hungry so I called the store and let me tell you THEY TOOK FOREVER TO ANSWER THE CALL. Once they did, this guy didn't understand me at all that my pizza didn't have pepperoni so I talked to someone else and I told him. I have a pizza in front of me just with jalapeños and no pepperoni, so he said ahhhhh ok?? So what do you want me to do?? And I said well send me the pizza that I ordered. He pretty much was lagging and telling me that it was 11pm which they close at midnight that it was impossible to do it. I told him straight up its not my fault they messed up and I was hungry right now. Dominos should teach their employees that when they messed up they are supposed to fix it even of its delivered. I used to work at Macdonalds and let me tell you it was all about fixing wrong orders costumers happy..







Paid for a two topping pizza. Asked for extra pineapple and paid for it. Pizza came in with no pineapple instead of double. So now I have a one topping when I paid for two with double toppings. Called at 12:40 and no one picks up. I get they close in 20 minutes but now I'm stuck with a pizza that I don't want and I paid for something else.

I called the next day and the guy wanted me to pay for a delivery charge because he couldn't void it. I told him no the mistake wasn't my fault. He finally gave us what we paid for but it was a huge hassle.







Ordered food tonight and it never showed up. I got a confirmation email and saw that the pizza had been placed in the oven by Jorge. After almost an hour of waiting I checked the dominos tracker and the order was no longer found. Looks like the employees decided it was time to get off. Guess I should have checked the reviews before ordering here.







I used their online ordering service to order a pizza and some chicken as well as a few other items which was cool and pretty easy to do, unfortunately the food never came when it was supposed to be delivered.  It actually never came at all.  I tried to call them several times to check on it but it just went to their hold recording and then hung up on me. Their online app actually said that the pizza was delivered to me but it never was. Just terrible. I will never order from this place again.  I would give them zero stars if I could.







The food is generally good from this location. However I went in to pick up an order on Sunday, October 16 at 1 PM and the male server (I did not catch his name) that was there who is apparently normally a route delivery driver used a great amount of 
profanity in front of customers. I thought  this was inappropriate. My sense is that he will not recall this because it is probably part of his general speech pattern and part of who he is. Still,  I  find it to be inappropriate.

Guy made a suggestion which helped me save money.  Thank you!!!  The phone service is okay.  No enthusiasm but it's okay, it's the Bay Area we talk to millions of people everyday.It took 45-50 minutes pretty much the quoted time he said for the pizza to get her during the dinner rush.  It was good pizza!  $19.99 out the door for a large pizza with delivery.  The 7.99 deal is take out only.  I usually pick up but the wonderful thing about pizza is ever night is pizza night or can be and it can be delivered if needed and I was in a hurry.They didn't my cell to let me know he was here but that's okay.  It was hot and delicious and alittle doughy but very good and the chicken slices on the pizza were pretty good not very tiny like some places.  I would suggest to everyone to save money, go their in person or order online but the fastest way is to order over the phone and for delivery. . Thank you for making my dinner.A lot of the "in house" experiences are true on Yelp too.

So I'm not usually one to give a place such a poor rating but multiple times now I have ordered something and it came incorrect, undercooked, or overlooked.I've always picked up a pizza and over heard the manager at the time yelling very rude things to his employee and he challenged me to fight. He did not want it. The reason I'm writing this review today is because I thought I made mistake last when ordering online but after reviewing my last order on their app they did in fact forget the tomatoes. Not to mention when the delivery driver arrived he complained about the tip and asked for more. He forgot my napkins and shook his head when I gave him another dollar.Very unethical and very rude. Giving them one last chance tonight.








first pizza showed up with only mushrooms.

Horrible Horrible Experience with Dominos...Never again ordering  ever...We made an online order at 12 20 and waiter for an hour and there was no pizza, so when i called back they inform me that there was a new driver and he was at the apartment but did not know which building it was and tried to contact but it was a old number on my profile and hence could not reach me... I mean come on, you can ask the leasing office or anyone around, its not that difficult...So they promised to send it back again in 15 mins, i waited another half an hour and still nothingSo i called again, and this time they state, its on the way and will be there in 2 minsI wait for 15 more mins and still nothingThis was for the kids and the order was place at 12 20 and now its 2 PM, i mean this is heights of dominos attitudeSo i call them again, and tell them, you cannot be this late and even if you deliver, it will be a cold pizza and and i will not need it, he drops the calls so rudely...this is horrible horrible service I do not know if they will cancel the order and refund me Please improve you customer experience otherwise there will not be people ordering from your store ever again

Worst service ever,  #1 I called to order a pizza and the guy wouldn't give me online prices, said I had to order online. He actually yelled at me, said..."That's what I said Maam!" Okay, I did that. I brought my pizza home and was so hungry and excited but when I bit into my pizza and it was horrible,  no garlic cream sauce, no flavor, I ordered extra red sauce on tbe other,  no flavors just bad all together. Tasted like tomato paste on bread. I called to tell the guy and he argued with me and then said he would get his manager for me, instead...HE HUNG UP ON ME! Sorry, never again... I'm so disappointed,  I went to Dominoes because the commercials claim they use fresh products, I could have bought a better frozen pizza.

Live in the neighborhood and have never had a bad experience with this Domino's. They're always on time and have never messed up an order (aside from the occasional missing dipping sauce!) so I'm not sure where all the negative reviews are from. The pizza has gotten a lot better in recent years and I'm always happy to order it!

Dumbass employees do not know what they're doing. Every time I order from here they always act like they have no clue what they're doing on the phone. They also took an hour & 20 minutes to deliver a medium pizza. Wow lmfao

They are known for delivery, in the past its been pretty good. This time, the driver left without my pizza, the application showed my pizza was delivered. Driver called me to give me the bad news, called the store, they had no idea, so I'm guessing the pizza was delivered to the wrong address. Manager offered a free pizza. Called 45 minutes later, and they had not even started making the pizza. Manager put my pizza at the back of the bus.Don't use these guys, they will lose your pizza. Had to cancel the order.

If you download the app, you can order a medium 2-topping pizza for around $6. I usually get the pan crust with white sauce, and it lasts me a couple days' worth of meals. I will say that, even though they're gracious with the cheese, they skimp on the toppings. But it's fast, cheap, nearby, and the employees are always friendly. And in spite of my preference for small businesses over franchises, it's a nice indulgence every so often.

I'm not trying to be contrary here, but everyone one with the 1-star reviews on this location are just mad about the terrible delivery service. The pizza itself is...Dominos..no surprises there. I agree, DON'T order delivery from here if you are expecting a timely delivery...but if you treat this place as a PICK-UP ONLY location I think you will be well served. Call in, give them your order and they get it done quickly. Even on the busiest Friday the most I had to wait for pick up was 30 minutes. Usually they have it ready in less than 10 min. The people who work here are really nice folks tryin to make an honest living, and the food quality is fine! Plus, it's cheap.

Put in an order for a party, and requested square cut slices (Domino's website allows this in its online order system). However, when I got the pizzas, the slices were radial. Instead of offering a replacement for this, the associate just wanted me to take the cut pizza's as is.

Will never use the Sunnyvale, Caliente St. location again. Driver was polite, but pizza arrived 1 hr and 18 minutes after order. (quoted 27-37 min) Your online dominos tracker said that the pizza had been delivered 35 minutes before it actually was. I tried to call the location and was hung up on twice after being put into queue, never being talked to. Stay away pizza people!

This review is solely based on their delivery service.My boyfriend and I ordered pizza online. We noticed it was taking longer than usual for the pizza to get to the door so we checked the status online. The status said the pizza was out the door at 6:42 pm. Fast forward an hour later, and we have still yet to get our pizza. I understand that maybe the driver is making multiple deliveries, and maybe our house isn't the first house to get delivered to, but it should not take more than an hour to get here. The pizza is already going to be cold by the time they get here. I called the store to check the status of the order and the manager, Ana, kept making up excuses as to why the delivery is late. "Oh sorry, we're a bit understaffed today. Two drivers called off." I understand stuff like this happens, but when I asked why the status online says it was already out the door, she said "We were really busy and just had to push out all these orders. But the driver left 3 minutes ago." Huh? That doesn't make sense. So they just update the status without it being true. I would have rather them leaving the order as is, knowing that my order wasn't made yet, versus them lying saying it left the store and me wondering why is it taking forever?All in all, take your money elsewhere. The delivery service sucks. Making you pay a delivery fee when they're not even on time. NOT GOING TO ORDER FROM DOMINOES EVER AGAIN. Update: As I was writing this review, the delivery guy finally came. As expected, the food was already cold. I lost my appetite. The driver didn't even apologize for taking a long time (90 minutes!) to get here. Like I said, just take your money elsewhere.

Just went to this location to pick up an order . Walked inside and there were two employees at the counter (one on the phone). I wasn't greeted by either of them. After about 30 seconds I say I have a pick up , with my name . The guy starts to scramble around looking for my order , asking what it was . After the guy who I assume is the manager gets off the phone (an older Asian gentleman) he hangs up and starts yelling "SHIT ! Lady is laughing at me! YOU CAN EAT AND ORDER OR NOT ! I don't give a shit!!" And walks away as his other employees laugh (still scrambling to find my order ). I work in customer service and if I were to talk like that in front of customers , I'd definitely be fired .they continued to laugh as the guy placed my salad in a bag and dropped it on the counter and walked away . I wasn't told thank you by any three employees . Completely unprofessional location , will not be going back here and I live 1 minute down the street . Would rather spend my time driving to Round Table .

They don't ever pick up the phone!!!! I been ordering from this store for a while and the pizza is been quite alright and I always tip good. The costumer service sucks big time when it comes to calling. I ordered a pepperoni pizza with jalapeños and when I open my pizza obviously starving, I only see jalapeños. That of course really upset me since I was hungry so I called the store and let me tell you THEY TOOK FOREVER TO ANSWER THE CALL. Once they did, this guy didn't understand me at all that my pizza didn't have pepperoni so I talked to someone else and I told him. I have a pizza in front of me just with jalapeños and no pepperoni, so he said ahhhhh ok?? So what do you want me to do?? And I said well send me the pizza that I ordered. He pretty much was lagging and telling me that it was 11pm which they close at midnight that it was impossible to do it. I told him straight up its not my fault they messed up and I was hungry right now. Dominos should teach their employees that when they messed up they are supposed to fix it even of its delivered. I used to work at Macdonalds and let me tell you it was all about fixing wrong orders costumers happy..

Paid for a two topping pizza. Asked for extra pineapple and paid for it. Pizza came in with no pineapple instead of double. So now I have a one topping when I paid for two with double toppings. Called at 12:40 and no one picks up. I get they close in 20 minutes but now I'm stuck with a pizza that I don't want and I paid for something else.I called the next day and the guy wanted me to pay for a delivery charge because he couldn't void it. I told him no the mistake wasn't my fault. He finally gave us what we paid for but it was a huge hassle.

Ordered food tonight and it never showed up. I got a confirmation email and saw that the pizza had been placed in the oven by Jorge. After almost an hour of waiting I checked the dominos tracker and the order was no longer found. Looks like the employees decided it was time to get off. Guess I should have checked the reviews before ordering here.

I used their online ordering service to order a pizza and some chicken as well as a few other items which was cool and pretty easy to do, unfortunately the food never came when it was supposed to be delivered.  It actually never came at all.  I tried to call them several times to check on it but it just went to their hold recording and then hung up on me. Their online app actually said that the pizza was delivered to me but it never was. Just terrible. I will never order from this place again.  I would give them zero stars if I could.

The food is generally good from this location. However I went in to pick up an order on Sunday, October 16 at 1 PM and the male server (I did not catch his name) that was there who is apparently normally a route delivery driver used a great amount of profanity in front of customers. I thought  this was inappropriate. My sense is that he will not recall this because it is probably part of his general speech pattern and part of who he is. Still,  I  find it to be inappropriate.

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]




Domino's Pizza logo used from 1996 until September 2012 in major English-speaking countries, and still use in many others


In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]




Domino's Pizza logo used from 1996 until September 2012 in major English-speaking countries, and still use in many others


In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]




A Creamy Bacon pizza from Dominos The Netherlands


The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]




Arie Luyendyk's Lola-Chevrolet which won the 1990 Indianapolis 500 for Doug Shierson Racing.


In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]




Domino's Pizza logo used from 1996 until September 2012 in major English-speaking countries, and still use in many others


In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

Domino’s Pizza: How Product Innovation Sparked a Turnaround


By Adam Jones  

					


					 |
				

				Mar 26, 2015				9:37 am EDT            










Product innovation
One of the most important ways to improve same-store sales is with product innovation. In the chart below, you can see that up until 2009, Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) had weak same-store sales. That same year, the company launched a new recipe in its core pizza category. The increase in traffic was so positive, the company built a campaign around the turnaround.

Over the years, the company has introduced premium items such as specialty chicken, handmade pan pizza, stuffed cheesy bread, and parmesan bread bites. Master franchisees in Domino’s international markets can also suggest menu item additions to suit tastes in their local markets.



Boost in same-store sales
The chart above shows the impact the new products had on same-store sales growth, which shot up from 0.5% in 2009 to an impressive 9.9% in 2010. For each following year, Domino’s also saw positive same-store sales growth, although menu innovation wasn’t the only reason.
How Domino’s fares against the competitors
Papa John’s (PZZA) reported higher same-store sales growth than Domino’s between 2011 and 2014. And, in 2014, Domino’s same-stores sales growth was 7.5% while Papa John’s was 8.2%. Pizza Hut under the Yum! Brands (YUM) reported -1% same-store sales growth in 2014.
Other factors influencing same-store sales
The US economy went into recession between December 2007 and June 2009, which had a negative impact on consumer discretionary stocks.
The recession also impacted several ETFs. Most affected were the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) and the iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC). XLY holds about 10% worth of restaurant stocks in its portfolio, including McDonald’s (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX). IYC has about 12% of its portfolio invested in restaurant stocks.
One way a company can hedge the economic risk inherent in the US is to expand internationally. In the next part of this series, we’ll look at how Domino’s has done just that.

SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWDPZ » Topics » SuppliersThis excerpt taken from the DPZ 10-K filed Feb 23, 2007.Suppliers  We have maintained active relationships of 15 years or more with more than half of our major suppliers.
Our suppliers are required to meet strict quality standards to ensure food safety. We review and evaluate our suppliers quality assurance programs through, among other actions, on-site visits, third party audits and product evaluations to
ensure compliance with our standards. We believe that the length and quality of our relationships with suppliers provides us with priority service and quality products at competitive prices.  We believe that two factors have been critical to maintaining long-lasting relationships and keeping our purchasing costs low. First, we are one of the largest domestic
volume purchasers of pizza-related products such as flour, cheese, sauce and pizza boxes, which allows us to maximize leverage with our suppliers when items are put out for bid on a scheduled basis. Second, we use a combination of single-source and
multi-source procurement strategies. Each supply category is evaluated along a number of criteria including value of purchasing leverage, consistency of quality and reliability of supply to determine the appropriate number of suppliers.

We currently purchase our mozzarella pizza cheese from a single supplier pursuant to a requirements contract that
provides for pricing based on volume. Our cheese cost is based on the market price of cheese plus a supplier margin. The supplier margin will be reduced as certain volume purchase levels are reached. Once a volume purchase level is reached, the
supplier margin is reduced and can only be further reduced in the future based upon attainment of higher volume purchase levels. The supplier agreement is terminable by us upon 90 days prior written notice. Our chicken is also currently purchased
from a single supplier. The majority of our meat toppings come from another single supplier under a contract that began in July 2005 and will expire in December 2007. The Crunchy Thin Crust dough is currently sourced by another single supplier
pursuant to requirements contracts that expire in 2009. We have the right to terminate these requirements contracts for quality failures and for uncured breaches.  We believe that alternative suppliers for all of these ingredients are available, and all of our pizza boxes,
sauces and other ingredients are sourced from various suppliers. While we may incur additional costs if we are required to replace any of our suppliers, we do not believe that such additional costs would have a material adverse effect on our
business. We also entered into a multi-year agreement with Coca-Cola effective January 1, 2003 for the contiguous United States. The contract provides for Coca-Cola to be our exclusive beverage supplier and expires on the later of
December 31, 2009 or such time as a minimum number of cases of Coca-Cola® products
are purchased by us. We continually evaluate each supply category to determine the optimal sourcing strategy.  We have not experienced any significant
shortages of supplies or any delays in receiving our food or beverage inventories, restaurant supplies or products. Prices charged to us by our suppliers are subject to fluctuation, and we have historically been able to pass increased costs and
savings on to our stores. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage the risk from changes in commodity prices. We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

History[edit]
1960s–1990s[edit]
In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased DomiNick's, a small pizza store at 301 West Cross Street[7] in Ypsilanti, Michigan, near Eastern Michigan University.[8] The deal was secured by a $500 down payment, and the brothers borrowed $900 to pay for the store.[9] The brothers planned to split the work hours evenly, but James didn't want to quit his job as a full-time postman to keep up with the demands of the new business. Within eight months, James traded his half of the business to Tom for the Volkswagen Beetle they used for pizza deliveries.[9] By 1965, Tom Monaghan had purchased two additional pizzerias; he now had a total of three locations in the same county. Monaghan wanted the stores to share the same branding, but the original owner forbade him from using the DomiNick's name. One day an employee returned from a pizza delivery and suggested the name Domino's. Monaghan immediately loved the idea and officially renamed the business Domino's Pizza, Inc. in 1965.[9]
The company logo originally had three dots, representing the three stores in 1965.[9] Monaghan planned to add a new dot with the addition of every new store, but this idea quickly faded, as Domino's experienced rapid growth.[9] Domino's Pizza opened its first franchise location in 1967[10] and by 1978, the company expanded to 200 stores.[11] In 1975, Domino's faced a lawsuit by Amstar Corporation, the maker of Domino Sugar, alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition. On May 2, 1980, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans found in favor of Domino's Pizza.[12]
International expansion[edit]

On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[13] That same year, Domino's opened its 1,000th store, its first in Vancouver Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton.[14] Also, in 1985, Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[15] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[16] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan with the first restaurant. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[17]
In February 2016, Domino's opened its 1,000th store in India.[18]
China[edit]
Domino's Pizza chose to use its traditional delivery-based business model in China, neither altering its flavors nor reducing the sizes of pizzas,[19] and promising a 30-minute delivery time.[20] The delivery time promise failed due to Chinese automobile traffic patterns stymieing the delivery operations.[20] The large pizza sizes prevented Chinese people from using knives and forks to eat them,[19] and takeout services were unpopular with Chinese people due to cultural reasons.[21] Savio S. Chan (Chinese: 陳少宏; pinyin: Chén Shàohóng) and Michael Zakkour, authors of China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them, wrote that Domino's "failed miserably" in its strategy,[20] resulting in the company being "basically" irrelevant in China, with 40 restaurants as of 2014.[19] By January 2014, the company introduced small restaurants in the China market. Jamie Fullerton of Vice stated that these restaurants served "solid, mildly overpriced pizzas" and did not have unique to China menu items.[22]
Sale[edit]
In 1998, after 38 years of ownership, Domino's founder Tom Monaghan announced his retirement, sold 93 percent of the company to Bain Capital, Inc. for about $1 billion, and ceased being involved in day-to-day operations of the company.[23] A year later, the company named Dave Brandon as its CEO.[24]
Present[edit]

In 2004, after 44 years as a privately held company, Domino's began trading common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "DPZ".[25] Industry trade publication Pizza Today magazine named Domino's Pizza "Chain of the Year" in 2003, 2010, and 2011.[26][27][28] In a simultaneous celebration in January 2006, Domino's opened its 5,000th U.S. store in Huntley, Illinois, and its 3,000th international store in Panama City, Panama making 8,000 total stores for the system.[29] In August 2006, the Domino's location in Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland, became the first store in Domino's history to hit a turnover of $3 million (€2.35 million) per year.[30] As of September 2006[update], Domino's has 8,200+ stores worldwide, which totaled $1.4 billion in gross income.[31]
Innovations[edit]
In 2007, Domino's introduced its Veterans Delivering the Dream franchising program and also rolled out its online and mobile ordering sites.[11] In 2008, Domino's introduced the Pizza Tracker, an online application that allows customers to view the status of their order in a real time progress bar.[32] The first Domino's with a dining room opened in Stephenville, Texas, giving the customers the option to either eat in or take their pizza home. Since 2005, the voice of Domino's Pizza's US phone ordering service has been Kevin Railsback.[33]
In a 2009 survey of consumer taste preferences among national chains by Brand Keys, Domino's was last — tied with Chuck E. Cheese's. In December that year, Domino's announced plans to entirely reinvent its pizza. It began a self-critical ad campaign in which consumers were filmed criticizing the then-current pizza's quality and chefs were shown developing a new pizza.[34][35] The new pizza was unveiled that same month. The following year, 2010 and Domino's 50th anniversary, the company hired J. Patrick Doyle as its new CEO and experienced a 14.3% quarterly gain. While admitted not to endure, the success was described by Doyle as one of the largest quarterly same-store sales jumps ever recorded by a major fast-food chain.[36][37]
In 2015, Dominos unveiled a special "pizza car" that can carry 80 pizzas, sides, 2-liter bottles of soda, and dipping sauces.[38] It also has a 140-degree oven on board and is more fuel efficient than a standard delivery car. Officially named the DXP, the car is built on the Chevy Spark platform and each car will be retired once it hits 100,000 miles.[39]
In 2016, Domino's in New Zealand delivered the world's first pizza delivery by unmanned aerial vehicle using the DRU Drone by Flirety.[40]
In February 2017, Domino launched a wedding registry with gifts delivered in the form of Domino's eGift cards.[41] Customers have the option of signing up for Domino's pizza package to be served for the event.[42]
In March 2017, Domino's announced a pilot project in Dutch and German cities using delivery robots to deliver food within a one-mile radius of stores in partnership with Starship Technologies.[43]
Naming[edit]
In August 2012, Domino's Pizza changed their name to simply Domino's to emphasize their variety of non-pizza product such as chicken wings, apple pies, lasagna, and pasta. At the same time, Domino's introduced a new logo that removed the blue rectangle and text under the domino in the logo, and changed the formerly all-red domino to be blue on the side with two dots and red on the side with one dot.[44][45]
Products[edit]

The Domino's menu varies by region. The current Domino's menu in the United States features a variety of Italian-American entrees and side dishes. Pizza is the primary focus, with traditional, specialty, and custom pizzas available in a variety of crust styles and toppings. In 2011, Domino's launched artisan-style pizzas. Additional entrees include pasta, bread bowls, and oven-baked sandwiches. The menu offers chicken side dishes, breadsticks, as well as beverages and desserts.[46]
From its founding until the early 1990s, the menu at Domino's Pizza was kept simple relative to other fast food restaurants, to ensure efficiency of delivery.[47] Historically, Domino's menu consisted solely of one pizza in two sizes (12-inch and 16-inch), 11 toppings, and Coca-Cola as the only soft drink option.[48]




A "make line" at a Domino's


The first menu expansion occurred in 1989, with the debut of Domino's deep dish or pan pizza. Its introduction followed market research showing that 40% of pizza customers preferred thick crusts. The new product launch cost approximately $25 million, of which $15 million was spent on new sheet metal pans with perforated bottoms.[49] Domino's started testing extra-large size pizzas in early 1993, starting with the 30-slice, yard-long "The Dominator".[50]
Domino's tapped into a market trend toward bite-size foods with spicy Buffalo Chicken Kickers, as an alternative to Buffalo Wings, in August 2002. The breaded, baked, white-meat fillets, similar to chicken fingers, are packaged in a custom-designed box with two types of sauce to "heat up" and "cool down" the chicken.[51][52]
In August 2003, Domino's announced its first new pizza since January 2000, the Philly Cheese Steak Pizza. The product launch also marked the beginning of a partnership with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, whose beef Check-Off logo appeared in related advertising.[53] Domino's continued its move toward specialty pizzas in 2006, with the introduction of its Brooklyn Style Pizza, featuring a thinner crust, cornmeal baked in to add crispness, and larger slices that could be folded in the style of traditional New York-style pizza.[54]
In 2008, Domino's once again branched out into non-pizza fare, offering oven-baked sandwiches in four styles, intended to compete with Subway's toasted submarine sandwiches. Early marketing for the sandwiches made varied references to its competition, such as offering free sandwiches to customers named "Jared," a reference to Subway's spokesman of the same name.[55]
The company introduced its American Legends line of specialty pizzas in 2009, featuring 40% more cheese than the company's regular pizzas, along with a greater variety of toppings.[56] That same year, Domino's began selling its BreadBowl Pasta entree, a lightly seasoned bread bowl baked with pasta inside, and the Lava Crunch Cake dessert, composed of a crunchy chocolate shell filled with warm fudge.[57] Domino's promoted the dessert by flying in 1,000 cakes to deliver at Hoffstadt Bluffs Visitor Center near Mount St. Helens in Washington state.[58]
In 2010, shortly after the company's 50th anniversary, Domino's changed its pizza recipe "from the crust up", making significant changes in the dough, sauce, and cheese used in their pizzas.[59] Their advertising campaign admitted to earlier problems with the public perception of Domino's product due to taste issues.[60][61]
In September 2012, Domino's announced it was going to roll out a pan pizza on September 24, 2012.[62] Following this move, the Deep Dish pizza was discontinued after 23 years of being on the menu.
In December 2013, Domino's Pizza, in Israel, unveiled its first vegan pizza, which uses a soy-based cheese substitute.[63][64]
After a stock low point in late 2009, the company's stock had risen 700 percent in the five years preceding February 2016.[65] Even as the American economy has suffered and unemployment has risen, Domino's has seen its sales rise dramatically through its efforts to rebrand and retool its pizza.[66]
In 2014, Domino's Pizza in Nigeria introduced the new Jollof Rice Pizza and The Beef Stew Pizza.
Beverages[edit]
Domino's serves Coca-Cola products and is the only "Big Four" pizza chain to do so. Rivals Papa John's Pizza and Little Caesars sold Coca-Cola in the past, but both switched to Pepsi, in 2007 and 2012, respectively. Pizza Hut, due to its previous ownership by PepsiCo, has a contract to sell Pepsi products in perpetuity. Domino's Pizza in Mexico switched to Pepsi in November 2012 and Domino's Pizza in Malaysia, Pakistan, Romania, Spain, New Zealand, and Taiwan are with Pepsi as well.
Corporate governance[edit]
Domino's management is led by J. Patrick Doyle, CEO from March 2010, formerly president of Domino's USA. Previous chief executive Dave Brandon remains chairman.[67] Among 11 executive vice presidents are Jeffrey Lawrence, CFO; Stan Gage, Team USA; Scott Hinshaw, Franchise Operations and Development; and Kenneth Rollin, General Counsel.[68] Domino's operations are overseen by a board of directors led by Brandon. Other members of the board are J. Patrick Doyle, Andy Ballard, Andrew Balson, Diana Cantor, Richard Federico, James Goldman, Bud Hamilton, and Gregory Trojan.[69]
Charitable activities[edit]
In 2001, Domino's launched a two-year national partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation of America. That same year, company stores in New York City and Washington D.C. provided more than 12,000 pizzas to relief workers following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. Through a matching funds program, the corporation donated $350,000 to the American Red Cross' disaster relief effort.[16] In 2004, Domino's began a partnership with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, participating in the hospital's "Thanks and Giving" campaign since the campaign began in 2004, and raising $5.2 million in 2014.[70]
Advertising[edit]

In the 1980s, Domino's was well known for its advertisements featuring the Noid. That concept was created by Group 243 Inc. who then hired Will Vinton Studios to produce the television commercials that they created. The catchphrase associated with the commercials was "Avoid the Noid." The Noid was discontinued after Kenneth Lamar Noid, believing the mascot to be an imitation of him, held two Domino's employees hostage in Chamblee, Georgia.[71] The employees escaped while Noid ate a pizza he had ordered.[72] Noid was eventually diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and acquitted due to insanity, and later committed suicide.[73][74] The Noid was briefly brought back for a week in 2011 in an arcade-style game on the Domino's Facebook page. The person with the top score received a coupon for a free pizza.[75]
Due to a glitch on the Domino's website, the company gave away nearly 11,000 free medium pizzas in March 2009. The company had planned the campaign for December 2008 but dropped the idea and never promoted it. The code was never deactivated, however, and resulted in the free giveaway of the pizzas across the United States after someone discovered the promotion on the website by typing in the word "bailout" as the promotion code and then shared it with others on the Internet. Domino's deactivated the code on the morning of March 31, 2009, and promised to reimburse store owners for the pizzas.[76]
Domino's sponsored CART's Doug Shierson Racing, which was driven by Arie Luyendyk and won the 1990 Indianapolis 500. In 2003, Domino's teamed up with NASCAR for a multi-year partnership to become the "Official Pizza of NASCAR."[77] Domino's also sponsored Michael Waltrip Racing and driver David Reutimann during the 2007 season in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series.
30-minute guarantee[edit]
Starting in 1973, Domino's Pizza had a guarantee that customers would receive their pizzas within 30 minutes of placing an order or they would receive the pizzas free. The guarantee was reduced to $3 off in the mid-1980s. In 1992, the company settled a lawsuit brought by the family of an Indiana woman who had been killed by a Domino's delivery driver, paying the family $2.8 million. In another 1993 lawsuit, brought by a woman who was injured when a Domino's delivery driver ran a red light and collided with her vehicle, the woman was awarded nearly $80 million but accepted a payout of $15 million.[78] The guarantee was dropped that same year because of the "public perception of reckless driving and irresponsibility", according to then-CEO Tom Monaghan.[78]
In December 2007, Domino's introduced a new slogan, "You Got 30 Minutes," alluding to the earlier pledge but stopping short of promising delivery in half an hour.[79]
The company continues to offer the 30-minute guarantee for orders placed in its stores situated in Colombia, Vietnam, Mexico, China, and Turkey.
In Malaysia and Singapore, a refund is instead substituted with a "Free Regular Pizza Voucher".[80][81]
In India, the guarantee is for ₹300 ($5) and is valid for an order of less than 4 pizzas.
Franchises[edit]




Domino's Pizza World Map


Domino's Pizza currently has locations in 75 countries. It has its stores in 5,701 cities worldwide (2,900 international and 2,800 in the US). Domino's had approximately 11,000 stores as of the first quarter of 2014, with 774 in the UK, 4,986 in the US, and 1010 in India.[82][83] In most cases, Domino's has master franchise agreements with one company per country, but three companies have acquired multiple master franchise agreements, covering multiple countries:

The rights to own, operate, and franchise branches of the chain in Australia, New Zealand, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Monaco are currently owned by Australian Domino's Pizza Enterprises, having bought the master franchises from the parent company in 1993 (Australian and New Zealand franchises) and 2006 (European franchises).
The master franchises for the UK and Ireland were purchased in 1993 by the British publicly listed Domino's Pizza Group, which acquired the master franchise for Germany in 2011 and Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg in August 2012 by buying the Swiss master franchise holder, with an option to acquire the Austrian master franchise as well. Sweden opened its first Domino's near the Mobilia shopping mall in Malmö in December 2016.[84][85][86]
The master franchises for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, are currently owned by the Indian company Jubilant FoodWorks. India is the largest international market for Domino's outside its home market. The company operates 1004 stores across 230 Indian cities as of February 11, 2016. Apart from the United States, India is the only country that has over 1000 Domino's outlets. Indian pizza flavors such as paneer pizza, chicken tikka masala pizza, and kheema do pyaza pizza have been sold in other international markets.
In February 2015, cockroaches and rodent droppings found in the kitchens of some Domino's Pizza joints in Peru have caused the company to shut temporarily operations in the country[87][88] until August 28, 2016.[89]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
