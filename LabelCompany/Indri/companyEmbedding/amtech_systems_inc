Zacks Rank:



                                                 3-Hold     3     




Style Scores:



C Value | A Growth | D Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Financial Overview 

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

> DOWNLOAD - Code of Ethics


Amtech Group Code of Ethics
“Integrity and Values”
Build Trust and
        Credibility

        The success of our business is dependent on the trust and confidence we
        earn from our customers, employees, suppliers and shareholders. We gain
        credibility by adhering to our commitments, displaying honesty and
        integrity and reaching company goals solely through honorable conduct.
        It is easy to say what we must do, but the proof is in
        our actions. 

        When considering any action, it is wise to ask, “Will this build
        trust and credibility? Will it help create a working setting in which
        Amtech Group can succeed over the long term? Is the commitment I am
        making one I can follow through with?” The only way we will maximize
        trust and credibility is by answering “yes” to those questions and
        by working every day to build our trust and credibility.

Respect for the Individual 

        We all deserve to work in a setting where we are treated with dignity
        and respect and where we feel comfortable to speak our mind,
        particularly with respect to ethics. Amtech Group is committed to
        creating such an environment because it brings out the full potential
        in each of us, which, in turn, contributes directly to our business
        success. 

        Amtech Group is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to
        providing a workplace that is free of discrimination of all types from
        abusive, offensive or harassing behavior whether on or off premises,
        during and after working hours. Employees who feel harassed or
        discriminated against should report the incident to their manager or to
        human resources immediately, or contact the Ethics Hotline in the
        United States at 1-866-413-1994 or Web
        portal under the company name Amtech Systems.  

Setting the Tone at the Top

        All executives and managers have the responsibility for demonstrating
        the importance of this Code of Ethics, Integrity and Values (the Code).
        Ethical behavior does not simply happen; it is the product of clear and
        direct communication of expectations, modeled from the top and
        demonstrated by example. To make our Code work, managers are
        responsible for promptly addressing ethical questions or concerns
        raised by employees or others and for taking the appropriate steps to
        deal with such issues. Managers should not consider employees’ ethics
        concerns as threats or challenges to their authority, but rather as
        another form of business communication. At Amtech Group, we want the
        ethics dialogue to become a natural part of daily work.

Uphold the Law 

        Amtech Group’s commitment to integrity begins with complying with
        laws, rules and regulations where we do business. Further, each of us
        must have an understanding of the company policies and regulations that
        apply to our specific roles. If we are unsure of whether a contemplated
        action is permitted by law or Company policy, we should seek the advice
        from a subject matter expert. We are responsible for preventing
        violations of law.

        Because of the nature of our business, some legal requirements warrant
        specific mention here.

Competition 

        We are dedicated to ethical, fair and vigorous competition. We will
        sell our products and services based on their merit, quality,
        functionality and competitiveness. We will make independent pricing and
        marketing decisions and will not improperly cooperate or coordinate our
        activities with our competitors. We will not offer or solicit improper
        payments or gratuities in connection with the purchase of goods or
        services or the sales of our products or services.

Proprietary Information 

        It is important that we respect the property rights of others. We will
        not acquire or seek to acquire by improper means a competitor’s
        confidential information. We will not engage in unauthorized use,
        copying, distribution or alteration of any third party intellectual
        property.

Selective Disclosure 

        We will not selectively disclose any material nonpublic information
        with respect to Amtech Group, business operations, plans, financial
        condition, results of operations or any development plan. We should be
        particularly vigilant when making presentations or proposals to
        customers to ensure that our presentations do not contain material
        nonpublic information.

Health and Safety 

        Amtech Group is dedicated to maintaining a healthy environment. 
Avoid Conflicts of
        Interest

        We must avoid any relationship or activity that might impair, or even
        appear to impair, our ability to make objective and fair decisions. We
        owe a duty to Amtech Group to advance its legitimate interests when the
        opportunity to do so arises. We must never use our position with Amtech
        Group or Amtech Group property or information for personal gain.

Gifts, Gratuities and Business Courtesies 

        Amtech Group is committed to competing solely on the merit of our
        products and services. We should avoid any actions that create a
        perception that favorable treatment of outside entities by Amtech Group
        was sought, received or given in exchange for personal business
        courtesies. We will neither give nor accept business courtesies that
        constitute, or could reasonably be perceived as constituting, unfair
        business inducements that would violate law, regulation or policies of
        Amtech Group customers, or would cause embarrassment or reflect
        negatively on Amtech Group’s reputation.

Accepting Business Courtesies 

        Most business courtesies offered to us in the course of our employment
        are offered because of our positions. We should not feel any
        entitlement to accept and keep a business courtesy. Although we may not
        use our position to obtain business courtesies, we may accept
        unsolicited business courtesies that promote successful working
        relationships and good will with the firms that Amtech Group maintains
        or may establish a business relationship with.

        Employees who award contracts or who can influence the allocation of
        business, who create specifications that result in the placement of
        business or who participate in negotiation of contracts must be
        particularly careful to avoid actions that create the appearance of
        favoritism or that may adversely affect the company or its reputation
        for impartiality and fair dealing. 

Meals, Refreshments and Entertainment 

        We may accept occasional meals, refreshments, entertainment and similar
        business courtesies that are shared with the person who has offered to
        pay for the meal or entertainment, provided that:

They are not inappropriately lavish or excessive.
The courtesies are not frequent and do not reflect a pattern of
            frequent acceptance of courtesies from the same person or
          entity.
The courtesy does not create the appearance of an attempt to
            influence business decisions.
The employee accepting the business courtesy would not feel
            uncomfortable discussing the courtesy with his or her manager or
            co-worker or having the courtesies known by the public.

Gifts 

        Employees may accept unsolicited gifts, other than money, that conform
        to the reasonable ethical practices of the marketplace, including:

Flowers, fruit baskets and other modest presents that commemorate
            a special occasion.

Gifts of nominal value, such as calendars, pens, mugs, caps and
            t-shirts (or other novelty, advertising or promotional items). 

Generally, employees may not accept compensation, honoraria or money
        of any amount from entities with whom Amtech Group does or may do
        business. Tangible gifts (including tickets to a sporting or
        entertainment event) that have a market value greater than $100 may not
        be accepted unless approval is obtained from management.

Offering Business Courtesies 

        Any employee who offers a business courtesy must assure that it cannot
        reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to gain an unfair business
        advantage or otherwise reflect negatively upon Amtech Group. An
        employee may never use personal funds or resources to do something that
        cannot be done with Amtech Group resources. Accounting for business
        courtesies must be done in accordance with approved company
        procedures.

        We may provide nonmonetary gifts to our customers, but not to our
        government customers for whom special rules apply. Further, management
        may approve other courtesies, including meals, refreshments or
        entertainment of reasonable value, provided that:

The practice does not violate any law or the standards of conduct
            of the recipient’s organization.
The business courtesy is consistent with industry practice, is
            infrequent in nature and is not lavish.
The business courtesy is properly reflected on the books and
            records of Amtech Group.

Set Metrics and Report Results
        Accurately 

Accurate Public Disclosures 

        We will make certain that all disclosures made in financial reports and
        public documents are full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable.
        This obligation applies to all employees, including all financial
        executives, with any responsibility for the preparation for such
        reports. No business goal of any kind is ever an excuse for
        misrepresenting facts or falsifying records.

        Employees should inform Management and HR if they learn that
        information in any filing or public communication was untrue or
        misleading at the time it was made or if subsequent information would
        affect a similar future filing or public communication.

Corporate Recordkeeping 

        We create, retain and dispose of our company records as part of our
        normal course of business in compliance with all Amtech Group policies
        as well as all regulatory and legal requirements.
        All corporate records must be true, accurate and complete, and company
        data must be promptly and accurately entered in our books in accordance
        with Amtech Group’s and other applicable accounting principles.

        We must not improperly influence, manipulate or mislead any authorized
        audit, nor interfere with any auditor engaged to perform an internal
        independent audit of Amtech Group books, records, processes or internal
        controls.

Accountability

        Each of us is responsible for knowing and adhering to the values and
        standards set forth in this Code and for raising questions if we are
        uncertain about company policy, the law or regulations. If we are
        concerned whether the standards are being met or are aware of
        violations of the Code, we must contact the HR department or Ethics
        Point in the manner described under our whistle-blower’s policy.
        Amtech Group takes seriously the standards set forth in the Code, and
        violations are cause for disciplinary action up to and including
        termination of employment.

Be Loyal 

Confidential and Proprietary Information 

        Integral to Amtech Group’s business success is our protection of
        confidential company information, as well as nonpublic information
        entrusted to us by employees, customers and other current or potential
        business partners. We will not disclose confidential and nonpublic
        information without a valid business purpose and proper
        authorization.

Use of Company Resources 

        Company resources, including time, material, equipment and information,
        are provided for company business use. Employees and those who
        represent Amtech Group are trusted to behave responsibly and use good
        judgment to conserve company resources. Managers are responsible for
        the resources assigned to their departments and are empowered to
        resolve issues concerning their proper use.
        Generally, we will not use company equipment in the conduct of an
        outside business or in support of any religious, political or other
        outside activity, except for company-requested support to nonprofit
        organizations. We will not solicit contributions nor distribute
        non-work related materials during work hours.
        In order to protect the interests of the Amtech Group network and our
        fellow employees, Amtech Group reserves the right to monitor or review
        all data and information contained on an employee’s company-issued or
        connected electronic device, the use of the Internet or intranet, and
        the use of social media services related to company matters. We will
        not tolerate the use of company resources to create, access, store,
        print, solicit or send any materials that are harassing, threatening,
        abusive, sexually explicit or otherwise offensive or inappropriate.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
