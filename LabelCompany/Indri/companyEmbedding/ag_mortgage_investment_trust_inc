Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Explanation
Net income is the most widely cited number in reporting a companys profitability. It is linked to the most popular earnings-per-share (EPS) number through:
AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc's Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as



Earnings Per Share (Q: Mar. 2017 )=(Net Income-Preferred Dividends)/Total Shares Outstanding


=(25.118-3.367)/0


=



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.
Although Net Income and Earnings-per-Share (EPS) are the most widely used parameter in measuring a companys profitability and valuation, it is the least reliable. The reason is that reported earnings can be manipulated easily by adjusting any numbers such as Depreciation, Depletion and Amotorization and non-recurring items.
EPS is most useful for companies that have:

 A predictable business
 Consistent accounting methods
 And few restructurings
The dividend paid to preferred stocks needs to be subtracted from the total net income in the calculation of EPS because common stock holders are not entitled to that part of the net income.

Be Aware
Warren Buffett looks for consistency and upward long term trend. Because of share repurchase it is possible for net earnings trend to differ from EPS trend. He preferred net income over EPS. The companies with durable competitive advantage companies report higher % net earnings to total revenues.
Important: If a company is showing net earnings history greater than 20% on total revenues, it is probably benefiting from a long term competitive advantage.
If net earnings is less than 10%, likely to be in a highly competitive business.

Why AG Mortgage Investment Trust Is a Top 10 REIT Stock With 10.06% Yield (MITT)













Cash Dividend On The Way From AG Mortgage Investment Trust (MITT)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 6/15/17, AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.475, payable on 7/31/17. As a percentage of MITT's recent stock price of $18.99, this dividend works out to approximately 2.50%, so look for shares of AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc to trade 2.50% lower — all else being equal — when MITT shares open for trading on 6/15/17.
