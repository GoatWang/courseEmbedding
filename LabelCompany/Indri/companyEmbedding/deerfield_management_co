Mitral valve disease in the United States: retrospective analysis of hospitalizations and surgical procedures using the National Inpatient Sample (World Congress on Heart Disease abstract)





Mark Stuntz
World Congress on Heart Disease




access article here





                    a b s t r a c t
                







Introduction
Valvular heart disease (VHDs), of which the mitral valve is frequently implicated, are collectively responsible for more than 20,000 annual deaths in the United States and the economic burden on the public health system due to VHDs is estimated in the billions of dollars.

Objective
The aim of this study was to assess the number of mitral valve disease hospitalizations and surgical procedures in the United States during the period 2010-2013. 

Materials and Methods
Patient data were extracted from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS). The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient healthcare database in the United States, containing a 20% stratified systematic random sample of discharges from all US community hospitals. The most recent 4 years of available data, 2010-2013, were used for this analysis. Patients diagnosed with mitral valve disease were identified using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases 9th revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. ICD-9 procedure codes were used to identify surgeries to repair or replace the mitral valve, including transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR), open repair, tissue graft, and synthetic replacement. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-squared test, while continuous variables were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or independent samples t-test.

Results
There were 174,2587 discharge records in 2013 with a diagnosis of mitral valve disease. Using HCUP’s sampling weights, this extrapolates to 871,290 hospitalizations in the United States. This is a slight decrease from 2010, when there were 883,933 estimated hospitalizations. The mean age of patients hospitalized for mitral valve disease increased from 71.15 (95% CI: 71.08-71.23) years in 2010 to 71.68 (95% CI: 71.61-71.76) years in 2013 (p<0.0001). 61.7% of mitral valve hospitalizations were females in 2010 compared with 59.2% in 2013 (p<0.0001). Mitral valve surgical procedures increased from 35,111 procedures in 2010 to 38,030 procedures in 2013. Concurrently, the proportion of mitral valve disease patients that underwent a surgical procedure to repair or replace the mitral valve increased from 3.5% in 2010 to 3.9% in 2013 (p<0.0001). Among elderly patients ≥80 years of age, mitral valve disease represented an increasing proportion of all hospitalizations, increasing from 6.0% in 2010 to 6.6% in 2013. Patients with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who underwent a mitral valve surgical procedure were younger on average than those with a primary diagnosis of mitral valve disease who did not undergo a surgical procedure: 64.50 (95% CI: 64.31-64.69) years vs. 70.73 (95% CI: 70.51-70.95) years (p<0.0001).

Conclusions
This study reveals that mitral valve disease is a considerable public health problem in the United States, particularly among older adults. During 2010-2013, an increasing proportion of hospitalized patients with mitral valve disease underwent surgical procedures to repair or replace the valve. Overall, the volume of mitral valve surgical procedures increased approximately 8.3% from 2010 to 2013.

Deerfield and EuropaBio Publish a Report on Regulatory and HTA Scientific Advice for Small and Medium Enterprises - March  2015





NEW YORK & BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- EuropaBio, the European Association for Bioindustries, and the Deerfield Institute have partnered to carry out a survey on the current state of regulatory and health technology assessment (HTA) advice with a special focus on small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). The findings suggest early regulatory scientific and HTA advice may help SMEs to better prepare and manage their clinical programs toward facilitating both regulatory approval and positive HTA recommendations,and therefore contribute to their increased competitiveness.
Main findings 
“Despite agreement amongst all stakeholders that early interactions between regulatory, HTA authorities and SMEs would be positive, ensuring that these interactions actually take place is not straightforward. Given that many SMEs focus on the early stage of development and can be quite limited in terms of personnel and resources, the process of seeking such advice can be perceived as lengthy,formal, and cumbersome”, said Miriam Gargesi, Director for Healthcare Biotechnology at EuropaBio. However, the findings also show that both the authorities and the SMEs acknowledged the need to become more flexible, and to diversify and increase the number of interactions between them.
“Early dialogue activities have the potential to reduce drug development uncertainties related to regulatory and HTA assessments. While existing HTA scientific advice programs have made a good start and EuropaBio member companies have reported positive experiences so far, there are a number of other needs to be met,particularly in the areas of information, training and coordination”, said Paolo Morgese, Director of European Research for the Deerfield Institute and Chair of EuropaBio’s HTA Topic Group.
Background 
Phase III clinical trials are the last and vital development step before submitting healthcare biotech products for approval. While the costs for these trials are rising, the success rate is still 50% at phase III, according to the UK's Centre for Medicines Research. Success at phase III clinical trials is not the end of the story, as drugs will still have to go through regulatory and HTA evaluation processes before being accessible to European patients. Reviews from the European Medicines Agency, and to a larger extent from HTA authorities,have proven to be a significant challenge for biotech SMEs, often resulting in very limited access to new biotech drugs.
Against this context and the resulting significant financial burden incurred during phase III clinical trials, companies, regulatory and HTA authorities are starting to work together at earlier stages of drug development in order to make drug development more efficient. This could eventually help companies better understand what data the authorities need earlier in the process, thus leading to better designed clinical trials and fewer drugs failing at the approval stage, or not being reimbursed.
The full report is available on the websites of Deerfield (http://goo.gl/hR1aUM) and Europabio (http://goo.gl/VkdpZZ) 
About EuropaBio

N.Y. firm opens $1.6B healthcare investment fund

  By Rachel Landen
         | April 10, 2014
      


Deerfield Management Co., a New York investment firm, has opened a $1.6 billion private investment fund to provide financing to healthcare companies.Using equity, debt, royalty interests, joint ventures and other financing alternatives, Deerfield Private Design Fund III will invest in healthcare companies across the spectrum. Investments will include start-ups as well as more established companies in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical-device, healthcare services and animal-health markets.“Deerfield is proud to play a leading role in advancing innovation in the development and delivery of healthcare products and services through investment, information and philanthropy,” James Flynn, managing partner at Deerfield, said in a news release. “Few other industries can have such a profound impact on the quality and length of life.”Deerfield previously launched two healthcare investment funds, Deerfield Private Design Fund I and Deerfield Private Design Fund II. The investment period for the first fund is now over and the $500 million fund is expected to close in July 2015. The second fund is in the final stages of committing its approximately $1 billion in investments.Since the firm launched in 1994 with $17 million in equity, it has invested in companies to fund research and development, acquisitions, growth, and balance-sheet restructuring. Yesterday, Deerfield announced that it has entered into a $27.5 million debt financing agreement with orthopedic-device company OMNIlife science to help strengthen its balance sheet, finance the expansion of its product line, and advance the commercialization of its computer navigation and robotic platform for joint-replacement procedures. The financing will come from Deerfield Private Design Fund II, not the most recently-launched fund, said Karen Heidelberger, a partner at Deerfield Management.Follow Rachel Landen on Twitter: @MHrlanden

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

What should I look for in a professional HOA manager?
The most effective attributes a successful HOA Property Management Company can have are: 1.) the ability to handle day-to-day issues without supervision 2.) guide the Board's decision-making processes and 3.) be responsive to homeowners. 
Naturally, a successful HOA manager should be professionally compentent in all aspects of Association Management and have the requisite certifications and track record to perform their required duties. But there are other attributes that are important to be a successful HOA service provider.
Homeowners have more permanence than renters, so effective HOA Management must consider the long-term implications of its actions differently than a typical property management firm. Consistency, longevity and proven experience are important considerations, as are the interpersonal skills of the firm's managers in dealing with conflicts, emergencies and the expressed interests of the Board in improving their community.
With this in mind, it's important to hire an HOA management company that has proven methods for managing group politics and negotiating agreements among members with conflicting points of view. As you interview potential HOA managers, be sure to focus a significant portion of your discussions on understanding each manager's typical communication methods and tactics for conflict resolution.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.
