History




South Africa Alpha Capital Management (“SAACM”) is a Bermuda based Asset Management Company, founded on 10 December 2007.
In 2008, SAACM launched the South Africa Alpha Segregated Portfolio Company (“SAASPC”), a Cayman Islands domiciled SPC, and partnered with 36ONE Asset Management, who advised the first segregated portfolio on the SAASPC. The platform provides international investors access to US dollar denominated versions of local South African Hedge Funds.
SAACM has grown the business extensively, partnering with the majority of the Hedge Fund Managers in South Africa. Our offering includes managing the entire launch process of a USD class and on-going marketing, operational and compliance support for the Segregated Portfolios and the Advisors.
Today SAACM partners with 8 Investment Advisors and has 16 segregated portfolios in the SAASPC, with each segregated portfolio offering investors a unique investment strategy.
