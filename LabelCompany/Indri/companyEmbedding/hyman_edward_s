Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Walmart® Credit Card


                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment. And have not used this card in over 2 years. This is our debt, and we do without some things to make sure it gets paid here lately. He told...show more

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Item Description: William Morrow and Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1980. Hardcover. Book Condition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. Edward Lear (illustrator). First American Edtion. Wonderful large-format book of Edward Lear's bird paintings and drawings done earlier in his life, before his fame as a writer of limericks and Nonsense rhymes. With an introduction by Philip Hofer. 40 color and 50 black-and-white illustrations. A complex, frequently unhappy man, Lear often caricatured himself as an owl, and found solace and delight in the company of birds until his death in 1888 at the age of seventy-five. He abandoned bird painting in his mid-twenties because of failing eyesight, yet he continued to draw on his ornithological ability for his most enduringly popular creations, his Nonsense.
