This firm wants to bring private equity, venture capital investing to the . . . masses?


How does an upstart investment firm that once flew high on stellar returns recover from a swift swoon? Private-equity and venture-capital investments are high-risk, high-reward bets usually reserved for millionaires and pension funds. But Chicago-based Cedar Capital is bringing these elite funds to the masses as part of a broader bid to diversify its investment product lineup after its flagship Good Harbor mutual fund stumbled last year. This month the firm launched two mutual funds based on private equity and venture capital. The new products are likely to be tempting in a low-interest-rate environment, given the categories' historical double-digit returns. The diversification effort, which includes listing funds managed by partner firms, is intended to rev up sales and pay for an operational infrastructure Cedar built when it was managing $11 billion two years ago, not the $2 billion it has today.  “When you have that kind of momentum in your assets, there's always a certain amount of anxiousness,” Cedar Chief Investment Officer Neil Peplinski says of the surge in assets before the slide. “We have some exciting (products) and a road map we're executing on to try to rebuild.”  Founded in 2008, Cedar Capital has unorthodox roots. Peplinski, 44, co-founded the firm with now-CEO Paul Ingersoll, 49, not long after the pair met at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Before heading to Booth, Peplinski had been an electrical engineer at Motorola, designing equipment for cellular towers. But he dabbled in investments on the side with results that led some colleagues and friends to hand him money, he says. After graduating from Booth in 2006, he got a taste of professional investing for a couple of years managing a portfolio of synthetic collateralized debt obligations at Allstate Insurance. For his part, Ingersoll was coming off a failed effort to team with a California private-equity firm and buy a division of Evanston-based National Equipment Services, an equipment rental company that he had worked for until late 2002. He helped steer that company through an IPO in 1998 with backing from Chicago private-equity firm GTCR; he left before it filed for bankruptcy in 2003.







Peplinski's investment strategy, which hinges on his reading of risk-taking in the market, relied on a mix of stock and government bond mutual funds. Later, he turned to exchange-traded funds. In 2009, he delivered 40-plus percent returns, Cedar says, compared with a 24 percent rise in the S&P 500 index. With those numbers, people threw money at the firm.  Cedar had been taking investments for private accounts, but late in 2012 it launched its first mutual fund, the Good Harbor Tactical Core US Fund. Four more followed in the next couple of years. By early 2014, the firm had $11 billion under management, but later that year the flagship Tactical Core US product stalled, ultimately posting a 21 percent dive compared with the S&P 500's 11 percent climb. So money flowed out. To recover, Cedar is introducing a variety of products, including the private-equity and venture-capital funds that will be part of a new Leland brand. (Products are named for the geography of northern Michigan, where Peplinski grew up on a dairy farm in Maple City.) The firm also is teaming with Chicago-based RiverNorth Capital Management and others to market under other brands. It aims to buy the assets of a hedge fund called F-Squared Investments out of bankruptcy proceedings to reincarnate that strategy under its BroadMeadow Capital subsidiary. “We wanted our products to be diversified so that we're not dependent on a single strategy,” Ingersoll says. With its new offerings, Cedar is leaping into “liquid alternative investments,” which are tradeable mutual funds that attempt to mimic the strategies of hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture-capital funds—instruments typically roped off for more sophisticated investors. In recent years, everyday investors have poured money into these alternatives in search of richer results.  There is about $300 billion in a wide array of liquid alternatives today, versus nothing 10 years ago, says Josh Charney, a Chicago analyst who covers the space for Morningstar. “They are one of the fastest-growing mutual fund categories,” he says. Cedar's new venture-capital and private-equity funds aim to copy the returns of those privately held asset categories, but the firm is basing its strategy on two inexact Thomson Reuters indexes. It's difficult not only to get valuation data on those privately held assets, but also to find publicly traded assets that mirror their prospects.   “Unless the theory of private equity is baloney, those companies are different,” says Erik Gordon, a University of Michigan professor who specializes in venture capital and private equity. Cedar itself is privately held and partly owned by two private equity firms: Philadelphia-based LLR Partners and San Francisco-based FTV Management.  Peplinski acknowledges that the two new funds are somewhat of an “experiment.” Even so, there's likely to be demand, given the retail appetite for liquid alternatives. But Cedar will be under pressure not to disappoint investors again.

Our Story |


Our Team |


Let US Help|






It's a cruel world out there for the small business owner. And we can relate because we're entrepreneurs, just like you. We work with business owners throughout their companies' life cycles, helping them overcome the obstacles blocking effective compliance. And we provide the kind of thought leadership and guidance that will inspire and encourage their continued success, no matter the odds.
We got into this business because helping entrepreneurs is our passion. And we strongly believe in the power of private enterprise.





Wilmington, Delaware, in 1899, a young attorney named Christopher Ward had a big idea: create a firm that would make it easier for businesses to form corporations. Around the same time, another Delaware attorney named Josiah Marvel, had the very same idea.
After two decades in business, Ward and Marvel joined forces to create the first company solely dedicated to the business of being in business. At the time, it was called Corporation Service Company® (CSC®).
From Corporation Service Company to The Company Corporation® to incorporate.com, we may have changed our look but we still have more than a century's worth of experience in our business. To date, we've helped form more than 750,000 corporations or LLCs, and we've provided services to those companies that have improved their business compliance along every arduous step.





Simply put, we know what you're going through. Many of our team members ran their own companies before joining us. So when we say, "we've been there," we actually mean it. Our employees care for your orders as if they were their own, because, yeah, they've been there. And together, we've been there before more than 750,000 times.
We know that our success grows from your success, so we strive to fulfill your business needs with enthusiasm, speed, and absolute professionalism. We won't treat you like Joe Schmoe. We'll listen to you like a business partner.
Welcome to an entire corporation full of people who love corporations more than anything in the world?a mighty team of credible, approachable folks just like you who are forever dedicated to helping you do it right and do it better.




incorporate.com provides a range of services that are appropriate to every state of the small business life cycle.

 We help companies incorporate and form limited liability companies (LLCs) and may other entity types. Our formation services are available in every U.S. state as well as the District of Columbia.
We serve as a Registered Agent for thousands of U.S. businesses, making sure that our customers receive their legal and business critical documents quickly and securely.
We help businesses apply for tax information, including IRS-required Employer Identification Numbers (EINs) and, for nonprofit companies, 501(c) status.
We help new entities with their bylaws and operating agreements, reserve their unique company names, and register to do business in other states.
We help companies meet their ongoing compliance requirements, including annual report preparation, filing and research to find out what business licenses are needed in the form of a Business License Compliance Package.

Our coaching services put small business owners in touch with friendly, knowledgeable specialists who can guide them through their day-to-day compliance challenges. And Compliance Watch®, our exclusive online tool (free to our Registered Agent customers), sends handy reminders every time your corporate filings are due and provides many other assets that set your feet firmly on the path to easier business compliance.
