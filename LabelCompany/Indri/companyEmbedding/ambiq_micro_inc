Ambiq Micro Products











Ambiq Micro is redefining “ultra-low power” with their revolutionary Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT™) platform. The patented SPOT architecture uses transistors operating in the extremely low subthreshold voltage region to reduce energy usage by an order of magnitude.

Ambiq Micro’s lineup of ultra-low power Microcontrollers (MCU) and Real-time Clocks (RTC) based on the SPOT platform are ideal for battery-operated applications where optimal power-efficiency is essential.

Ultra-low Power MCUs




Ultra-low Power RTC








Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT™)
Ambiq Micro’s unique and proprietary SPOT platform provides unparalleled energy efficiency with its breakthrough subthreshold design.
The SPOT platform utilizes the leakage from “off” transistors to compute in both the digital and analog domains, thereby eliminating the need for transistors to turn all the way “on.” By handling most computations using only leakage current, SPOT reduces total system power consumption down to the nanoamp range.



Subthreshold operation can reduce energy usage by an order of magnitude
The SPOT platform does not impact performance. Ambiq Micro’s products behave just like any other semiconductor device. The one difference: dramatically reduced power consumption.
About Ambiq Micro
Ambiq Micro was founded in 2010 based on the notion that extremely low power semiconductors are key to the future of electronics. Ambiq Micro developed its patented Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT™) platform to deliver dramatically reduced power consumption for semiconductor devices. The company has offices in Austin, Texas and San Jose, California.
The Fujitsu Advantage
Fujitsu Electronics is proud to be an investor and official distributor of Ambiq Micro products, including the company’s lineup of ultra-low power Microcontrollers and Real-time Clocks.
For more than 80 years, Fujitsu has been a trusted global technology leader. Fujitsu Electronics is a distributor you can trust, with more than 35 years of experience supporting semiconductor and systems customers throughout the Americas.
Our extensive expertise in system design and development make us much more than a reseller. You can rely on our technical sales and field application support teams to have deep knowledge about your target end markets and applications. Our complete sales and supply chain management services ensure predictable product availability and lead time.

Ambiq Micro, Inc. Key Developments

Matrix Industries Selects Ambiq Micro's Ultra-Low Power Apollo MCU as the Main Processor for the Matrix PowerWatch
Jan 4 17
Ambiq Micro and Matrix Industries announced that Matrix selected Ambiq Micro's ultra-low power Apollo MCU as the main processor for the Matrix PowerWatch. The PowerWatch is the first smartwatch that never needs to be recharged. Apollo is built using Ambiq Micro's patented Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT™). This will enable the Matrix PowerWatch to charge using body heat as the first energy-harvesting wearable in production.


Fujitsu Electronics Inc. and Ambiq Micro Inc. Sign Distribution Agreement
Aug 17 16
Fujitsu Electronics Inc. and Ambiq Micro Inc. have signed a distribution agreement whereby FEI will market Ambiq Micro's Apollo family of ARM Cortex microcontrollers, or MCUs, and real-time clocks, or RTCs, in Japan, Asia and EU. With these devices, customers have an ideal solution for battery-powered and other power-sensitive applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable devices where energy savings translate into much longer battery life and enhanced feature sets. These semiconductor components can also enable much smaller batteries to be used, allowing greater creativity in the design and form factor of the end products that utilize these innovative solutions. The Apollo family of ARM Cortex MCUs and RTCs are the world's lowest-power devices of their kind, both based on Ambiq's patented Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT) platform.

The Apollo family of ARM Cortex MCUs and RTCs are the world's lowest-power devices of their kind, both based on Ambiq's patented Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT) platform. This innovative technology enables the ability to operate transistors at voltage levels that are far below what is considered "standard" by semiconductor industry standards, resulting in solutions that go well beyond the incremental improvements in power consumption of other semiconductor devices. The Apollo MCU features active mode current in the order of 34IzA/MHz when running from flash and sleep mode current less than 150nA. In addition, Apollo MCU has made history as a microcontroller that consumes less than half the energy of any other when tested to the industry-standard EEMBC ULPBench benchmark3.

Apollo2
Ultra-Low Power Microcontrollers

							Ambiq Micro, Inc.
The Apollo2 MCU Family is an ultra-low power, highly integrated microcontroller designed for battery-powered devices including wearable electronics, activity and fitness monitors, and wireless sensors. By combining ultra-low power sensor conversion electronics with the powerful ARMCortex-M4 processor with Floating Point Unit, the Apollo2 MCU enables complex sensor processing tasks to be completed with unprecedented battery life. Weeks, months, and years of battery life are achievable while doing complex context detection, gesture recognition, and activity monitoring. The Apollo2 MCU takes full advantage of Ambiq Micro’s patented Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT) Platform, setting a new industry benchmark in low power design.

Product Description
The Apollo2 MCU is the 2nd generation controller building upon Ambiq Micro’s Apollo MCU product family. The Apollo2 MCU integrates up to 1 MB of flash memory and 256 KB of RAM to accommodate radio and sensor overhead while still leaving plenty of space for application code. This microcontroller also includes serial master and UART ports for communicating with radios and sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers.
