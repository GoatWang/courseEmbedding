As demand for aviation parts and supplies increases, aircraft cabin interior maker B/E Aerospace is expecting significant growth ahead.
While B/E is headquartered in Wellington, Fla., Werner Lieberherr, B/E Aerospace’s president and chief operating officer, manages operations from Winston-




 


Salem, where the business employs nearly 1,100 full-time workers and houses its aircraft seating product division and commercial aircraft segment. B/E Aerospace also houses numerous core functions in Winston-Salem, ranging from strategy and global operations to human resources, supply chain and marketing.
You became president and COO in 2010. How has the company changed since? I would say it changed in a positive way. We have more revenues and we were able to hire more people.
Last year was a record year for B/E Aerospace, with 30 percent growth in the commercial aircraft segment. To what do you attribute that growth?
Out of the 30 percent, I would say probably at least half of it came from the seating business.
What do you think is driving that?
It’s a good market. I also believe that we have a very competitive product. We invest a lot in innovation, product development. We invest a lot in terms of having the right people in the right place, creating a motivating environment and I think that drives the growth to a large degree.
One of B/E Aerospace’s products is the lightweight Pinnacle seat. How have customers reacted to that lightweight seat?




I think they reacted very well. The Pinnacle seat was actually the most successful seat introduction of any economy seat, including the competition, so we are very proud of that. We were able to win orders for 1,300 aircraft, which is a lot, and about $650 million in revenue, so it’s massive. It’s a very successful product.
B/E Aerospace recently won an $800 million deal from Boeing. Can you talk about the significance of that deal? It’s one of, if not the most important wins, for our company. It’s actually a lavatory for the 737. It’s a very innovative solution. We actually made more space. I would say depending on the airline, between two and six seats more on the 737 aircraft, which is a very big deal.

Did you play a role in that deal? Yes. It’s always very hard to become a Tier 1 supplier to Boeing. To become a Tier 1 supplier on a high-rate program like the 737, yes, my team spent a lot of time on it. I spent a lot of time on it.
Has the consolidation of the airline industry affected business? I think in a positive way because we were actually very well-established with the market leaders. When I say market leaders in the airlines, it’s really Continental, United. In Europe, Air France and KLM came together. For us, it means more revenue because if you have a competitive product, they want to roll it out across the fleet.
Do you project that the seating business will increase?
Seating will definitely grow further. I would say the biggest challenge we have is to find engineers. It’s a big problem. We could grow even faster if we would actually be able to hire more engineers. I find the Triad area is a very compelling place to do business, but when it comes to that kind of resource, it’s scary.
What has B/E Aerospace done to bring that talent in? We look for people from outside the area. We run job fairs in different places. We approach universities for young engineers.
Does B/E Aerospace envision expanding its Winston-Salem facility?
What we do is we keep on hiring people. Yes, we look for more space because space is very constrained at this point from an office environment.




 


Where are you originally from? I grew up in Switzerland and then lived in various places, Europe, Middle East. Later, I moved to Asia.
What’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed culturally having lived in the U.S. and other parts of the world? When I look between Europe, Asia and the U.S., I think for each there is something to be said. In Europe, it’s the history, the culture, the diversity. Asia is extremely entrepreneurial. So I find that really compelling — the way they think about business, the drive, the commitment. In the U.S, I think it’s an easy way to live. We have two young kids and are very happy here. It’s a great place to raise children. I find to do business in the U.S., it’s a good environment. People I find are very committed. You can see this with our company. What I am the most proud of is our employees.
What is your management style?
I’m people-centric and I like to work in a team environment, but I would say I am demanding. I like to achieve results, but I like to do it together with people. Switzerland is very similar to the leadership style (in) the American environment. It’s very collaborative. I have an open door policy. I walk around in the office here and in other offices whereever I visit. I think it’s really important that you have the personal touch with many people in the organization because at the end of the day these people drive the results.
What are you passionate about outside of work? I would say my two little girls. They are 6 and 9 now. I travel a lot, so I spend a lot of time with them.
