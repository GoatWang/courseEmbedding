                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1869
                    



                        Joseph Campbell, a fruit merchant, and Abraham Anderson, an icebox manufacturer, form the business that would one day become Campbell Soup Company. They open their first plant in Camden, New Jersey.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1876
                    



                        Anderson leaves the partnership. Arthur Dorrance will join Campbell to form a new company in 1882.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1894
                    



                        Arthur Dorrance succeeds Joseph Campbell as President. Campbell retires, ending the association of the Campbell family with the company.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1895
                    



                        First can of Campbell’s ready-to-eat tomato soup introduced.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1897
                    



                        Dr. John T. Dorrance, a chemist at the company and nephew of then-president Arthur Dorrance, invents the formula for condensed soup. He creates five varieties, including Tomato, which remains one of the top 10 shelf-stable food items sold in U.S. grocery stores today.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1898
                    



                        A company executive attends the annual Cornell-Penn football game and is so taken with Cornell’s brilliant new red-and-white uniforms that he convinces Campbell to use the colors on soup labels.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1900
                    



                        The medallion that adorns the can was added after Campbell's soups win a medal for product excellence at the Paris Exposition.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1904
                    



                        The Campbell Kids are "born" when a Philadelphia artist sketches them for a series of streetcar advertisements.  Over the years, the Campbell Kids would be portrayed playing many roles, including army doctors during World War One and athletes training for the 2010 Winter Games.
                    






                        The Campbell story
                    

                        1911
                    



Campbell’s soups achieve national distribution.

                        1914
                    



                        Dr. John T. Dorrance becomes president of the company. Dr. Dorrance would lead the company until his death in 1930.
                    






                        The Campbell story

                        1922
                    



                        America loves condensed soup so much that Campbell adopts "soup" as its middle name, officially changing the company name to Campbell Soup Company.

OMAHA — David Biegger has been named executive vice president and chief supply chain officer of ConAgra Foods, Inc., effective Oct. 5. Prior to joining the company, Biegger was responsible for the global supply chain at Campbell Soup Co., where he oversaw manufacturing, quality safety, engineering, procurement, logistics, environmental sustainability and customer service.

“We are pleased to welcome Dave to ConAgra,” said Sean Connolly, CEO of ConAgra. “He has a wealth of relevant experience and will be a terrific leader of our talented supply chain team.

“We are committed to building stronger brands, enhancing margins and delivering more consistent results. Against this backdrop, Dave and his team will continue to enhance our supply chain capabilities to give us a competitive advantage.”

In his new role at ConAgra, Biegger will have end-to-end responsibilities for the company’s Consumer Foods business, including the manufacturing, procurement, environment, health and safety, plant quality, consumer logistics and planning and transportation and warehouse teams.

“ConAgra has a strong portfolio of brands whose success will be driven in part by a lean, entrepreneurial culture,” Biegger said. “I’m pleased to join Sean and the senior leadership team and am even more excited to have the opportunity to contribute to ConAgra’s continued growth and success.”

In August, another Campbell veteran joined the executive team at ConAgra. Darren Serrao was named to the newly created position of chief growth officer. The shuffle in leadership comes at a time of transition for ConAgra. During the company’s annual shareholders meeting on Sept. 25, Connolly cautioned of changes ahead, including job reductions and a possible move of headquarters.

Campbell Appoints Dave Biegger SVP, Global Supply Chain


Share on Facebook 



 




David White to Retire as SVP, Global Supply Chain

    CAMDEN, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Jan. 21, 2014–
Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) today announced the appointment
      of Dave Biegger, 55, as Senior Vice President, Global Supply Chain, with
      responsibility for engineering, procurement, manufacturing, logistics,
      customer service, quality and facilities. The appointment is effective
      April 1, 2014. Biegger succeeds David White, who will retire from the
      company after 10 years of service.
    

      Biegger joined Campbell in 2005 as Vice President, Strategic Planning,
      Global Supply Chain. In 2007, he was promoted to Vice President, North
      America Supply Chain, where he has consistently delivered significant
      cost savings through network optimization efforts, while also
      implementing key initiatives related to world-class manufacturing. In
      his new role, Biegger will also maintain responsibility for the Campbell
      North America supply chain.
    

      “Dave will play a critical role in our key strategies by creating a
      demand-driven supply chain, delivering consumer-focused innovation and
      operations excellence while driving cost and margin management,” said
      Denise Morrison, President and Chief Executive Officer, Campbell Soup
      Company. “Dave is a strategic leader with deep expertise in supply chain
      management, coupled with broad experience in managing and operating
      plants. He is the right leader for this role as we strengthen our core
      business and expand into higher growth spaces to reshape Campbell for
      the future.”
    

      Before joining Campbell in 2005, Biegger spent nearly 24 years with
      Procter & Gamble (P&G) in various positions of increasing seniority.
      During his tenure, Biegger held multiple supply chain roles in the U.S.
      and internationally, supporting P&G’s Fabric and Home Care and Family
      Care businesses. Biegger earned his Bachelor of Science degree in
      chemical engineering from Iowa State University.
    

White to Retire


      Under White’s leadership, Campbell’s Global Supply Chain has become a
      food industry leader and improved its performance relative to peers,
      delivering continuous improvement in almost all key supply chain
      metrics. He has been a major contributor to the expansion and renovation
      of Campbell’s World Headquarters in Camden, N.J., overseeing the
      construction of the 80,000 sq. ft. LEED-certified Campbell Employee
      Center. Recognized for his focus on employee safety, White and his team
      have reduced lost time injuries at Campbell by more than 80 percent.
      White has also been an important cultural leader, serving as an active
      Executive Sponsor of the Asian Network of Campbell since its inception
      in 2005.
    

      Morrison said, “David has been an invaluable member of the Campbell
      Leadership Team and has made significant improvements to our Global
      Supply Chain function during his tenure. I want to thank David and wish
      him and his family all the best in his retirement.”
