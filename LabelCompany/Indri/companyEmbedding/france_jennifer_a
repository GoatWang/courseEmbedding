                        Without science, we’d still be using pigmented dirt and crushed berries on our faces as ‘makeup.’

Congrats to Jennifer Aniston, People's "World's Most Beautiful Woman" of 2016!The Mother's Day star revealed her beauty and health secrets in the latest issue, including how hitting the gym six days a week makes her feel "really beautiful when I've finished a great workout," she said. Really, though, her beauty routine hasn't changed much from when she was named the mag's Most Beautiful in 2004.While 12 years ago, she admitted that she loved plucking her eyebrows and stopped wearing so much makeup after an early boyfriend told her she didn't need to—now, the actress prefers to keep things simple. "Less is more, less makeup, less full and just more natural," she recently told Vogue.

Less, however, is not none. And although the actress is beautiful (especially without makeup)—she keeps it notoriously mum on the few products that keep her looking ageless. What's really in her makeup bag? We dug through news archives and found almost every instance in which Jen shared her favorite products.

In 2013, Jen revealed her beauty tricks to RedBook, including using a few tried-and-true drugstore products, like L'Oréal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes (to get a safe glow) and petroleum jelly. "Put Vaseline on your eyes at night—all over. It helps condition your lashes," she told the mag.In the same year, the actress also revealed to New York Magazine two makeup essentials. "I always have a Fig lip liner by Estée Lauder; I've been using that pencil forever," she said. "I really like this concealer pencil by La Femme, which is double ended, one side is a concealer and the other is a highlighter."

While Jen knows the value of a good bargain brand, we're guessing she can afford a few luxury items as well. In November 2014, when Harper's Bazaar asked her about her go-to products, she answered, "Aveeno and Mila Moursi." Her favorite? Mila Moursi Lifting Serum, which rings in at a cool $440. The Firming Cream, however, costs a more affordable $170…silver lining!Of course, even the "World's Most Beautiful" are human and subjected to the occasional pimple. In these annoying times, Jennifer reaches for Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which the actress has "used for years and years," she said to Elle in 2015. Dr. Hauschka Lip Balm, By Terry Rose Balm and the Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Colour compact are also mainstays in her handbag.



NEWS: How Jennifer Aniston Went From Wedding Bliss to an Internal ''Breakdown''



So far, the A-lister's beauty routine may seem super simple, but we imagine she still reaches for a few beloved staples, like Chanel Le Blush Creme in Intonation and Bare Minerals Bareskin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation. "I don't know what it is about this foundation," said Jen to InStyle in March 2015. "Somehow the texture is super lightweight yet still gives great coverage."Finally, when it comes to nail colors, Jen has her favorites. "I'm not big on bright pink—for winter and fall, I go with a dark, deep bordeaux or cabernet colors, like Tom Ford's Bitter Bitch," Jen shared with Good Housekeeping in April. For more summertime-appropriate colors, Jen opts for more feminine colors, like the subtle pinks of Essie Mademoiselle and Essie Limo-Scene.

We know your go-to products evolve with time, and so probably has Jen's. However, there are a few products she'll most likely use for a long time coming: Aveeno, Smart Water and Living Proof. Sure, she is either the spokesperson or co-owner of said brands, but there's an authenticity in the way she promotes them in every beauty interview.We get it: She likes things simple, which is why Aveeno works for her. "Honestly, simplicity is the best. Don't get fooled by fancy bottles and expensive products," she told Glo. "I've learned that fancy products aren't necessarily the best!"And when speaking of her hair products, she can tell you how each product works on her tresses. "The beauty of Living Proof is that you don't need to wash your hair every day, because it doesn't have build-up from silicones or heavy oils, which is fantastic."Finally, every makeup artist, beauty guru and celeb knows the power of drinking a lot of water, to help retain moisture in your skin. So out of all the products she's trying to sell, we'll drink this one right up, thank you.

Congrats to Jennifer Aniston, People's "World's Most Beautiful Woman" of 2016!The Mother's Day star revealed her beauty and health secrets in the latest issue, including how hitting the gym six days a week makes her feel "really beautiful when I've finished a great workout," she said. Really, though, her beauty routine hasn't changed much from when she was named the mag's Most Beautiful in 2004.While 12 years ago, she admitted that she loved plucking her eyebrows and stopped wearing so much makeup after an early boyfriend told her she didn't need to—now, the actress prefers to keep things simple. "Less is more, less makeup, less full and just more natural," she recently told Vogue.



NEWS: Jennifer Aniston's Beauty Advice Is Basically Just Everything Your Mom Told You as a Teenager






Less, however, is not none. And although the actress is beautiful (especially without makeup)—she keeps it notoriously mum on the few products that keep her looking ageless. What's really in her makeup bag? We dug through news archives and found almost every instance in which Jen shared her favorite products.




Getty Images



In 2013, Jen revealed her beauty tricks to RedBook, including using a few tried-and-true drugstore products, like L'Oréal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes (to get a safe glow) and petroleum jelly. "Put Vaseline on your eyes at night—all over. It helps condition your lashes," she told the mag.In the same year, the actress also revealed to New York Magazine two makeup essentials. "I always have a Fig lip liner by Estée Lauder; I've been using that pencil forever," she said. "I really like this concealer pencil by La Femme, which is double ended, one side is a concealer and the other is a highlighter."




Getty Images



While Jen knows the value of a good bargain brand, we're guessing she can afford a few luxury items as well. In November 2014, when Harper's Bazaar asked her about her go-to products, she answered, "Aveeno and Mila Moursi." Her favorite? Mila Moursi Lifting Serum, which rings in at a cool $440. The Firming Cream, however, costs a more affordable $170…silver lining!Of course, even the "World's Most Beautiful" are human and subjected to the occasional pimple. In these annoying times, Jennifer reaches for Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which the actress has "used for years and years," she said to Elle in 2015. Dr. Hauschka Lip Balm, By Terry Rose Balm and the Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Colour compact are also mainstays in her handbag.



NEWS: How Jennifer Aniston Went From Wedding Bliss to an Internal ''Breakdown''



So far, the A-lister's beauty routine may seem super simple, but we imagine she still reaches for a few beloved staples, like Chanel Le Blush Creme in Intonation and Bare Minerals Bareskin Pure Brightening Serum Foundation. "I don't know what it is about this foundation," said Jen to InStyle in March 2015. "Somehow the texture is super lightweight yet still gives great coverage."Finally, when it comes to nail colors, Jen has her favorites. "I'm not big on bright pink—for winter and fall, I go with a dark, deep bordeaux or cabernet colors, like Tom Ford's Bitter Bitch," Jen shared with Good Housekeeping in April. For more summertime-appropriate colors, Jen opts for more feminine colors, like the subtle pinks of Essie Mademoiselle and Essie Limo-Scene.




Getty Images



We know your go-to products evolve with time, and so probably has Jen's. However, there are a few products she'll most likely use for a long time coming: Aveeno, Smart Water and Living Proof. Sure, she is either the spokesperson or co-owner of said brands, but there's an authenticity in the way she promotes them in every beauty interview.We get it: She likes things simple, which is why Aveeno works for her. "Honestly, simplicity is the best. Don't get fooled by fancy bottles and expensive products," she told Glo. "I've learned that fancy products aren't necessarily the best!"And when speaking of her hair products, she can tell you how each product works on her tresses. "The beauty of Living Proof is that you don't need to wash your hair every day, because it doesn't have build-up from silicones or heavy oils, which is fantastic."Finally, every makeup artist, beauty guru and celeb knows the power of drinking a lot of water, to help retain moisture in your skin. So out of all the products she's trying to sell, we'll drink this one right up, thank you.

Love Notes



Straight

                    Phenomenal                

Posted by Holly on July 04, 2017
I have used this product for a long time and then ran into some financial issues to where I couldn't buy this product for a couple months just to save. I noticed the difference in my hair when I stopped using this and when I started up again today I INSTANTLY noticed a difference. I'm never the kind of person to leave reviews even if they are bad... But having that immediate impact on my hair was just really nice and I want to share that. This product along with others I have used from the company work. I am and will always be a 100% satisfied customer!



Perfect hair Day (PhD) In-Shower Styler

                    This stuff is saving my hair!                

Posted by Leah on June 28, 2017
I have horrible, thin, fine, color damaged hair. On top of that, the only way I have been able to tame it is to straighten it once a day. I tried this stuff on a whim, and the first time I didn't like it. I was in a rush and I don't think I put enough in. So glad I gave it another shot, because it's amazing! I have perfect, beachy hair right now. Wavy and great texture, but not frizzy. Other products I've tried were not the same. Ive scrunched it and let it air dry, and I've also braided it over night. Both look great, and I don't have to feel guilty for all the heat styling. Can't wait to try some more of these products!



Restore Conditioner

                    Very Smoothing                

Posted by Emilie on June 27, 2017
I have been using LP products for the last 6 months and have been really loving everything I have tried.  Lately I have been stuck on the Full shampoo/conditioner but thought I would swap in this conditioner as I have damaged, dry hair.  Results were astonishing.  While my hair was not as full as it is with the Full conditioner (not surprising), it is incredibly smooth.  I have naturally curly hair that has been relaxed so I don't normally describe my hair as smooth, I almost have to get used to it :) I plan to bounce between Full and Restore conditioners.  Another LP product that does just what it says!    



Full Conditioner

                    Delivers on What is Promises!                

Posted by Emilie on June 27, 2017
Love, love, LOVE this product.  I have fine, dry, damaged hair and I really struggle to find products that are moisturizing but don't weigh my hair down.  The search is over!  This conditioner provides nice slip in the shower and is moisturizing without making my hair look greasy.  Last night I tried the Restore conditioner (will be writing that love note next) and while I loved it, it was a great test of the Full conditioner.  Results not nearly as, well, full :)  Thanks for great products!



Full Shampoo

                    Amazing!                

Posted by Emilie on June 27, 2017
I have held off on writing this because most products promising volume only temporarily work on my hair.  Not Full!  This product delivers on what it promises each and every time.  I have hair that is dry/damaged but is fine so I am always stuck choosing between health/moisture and volume. Not anymore.  The Full products are volumizing but not drying.  Living Proof for the win!  Thank you for creating great products!

Jennifer Aniston, the star of Cake and co-owner of Living Proof, loves a quick workout, loathes a makeup-remover wipe, and knows a thing or two about doctoring up a slice of brown-rice bread. We sat down with the star for InStyle's March issue, available on newsstands and digital download now, where we also discovered the six beauty products she can't live without. Pick up the March issue for our full Q&A, and keep scrolling to shop her beauty must-haves.

This small, fragrant cloth is making a major impact.Makeup artist Mary Phillips, whose clients include Jennifer Lopez, Chrissy Teigen and the Kardashian sisters, revealed one of her favorite products to E! News at the Becca x Chrissy Teigen Glow Face Palette launch: the Herban Essentials Lavender Bag. The bag includes 20 all-natural towelettes that can be used to clear blemishes, prevent scarring and remove makeup. Infused with lavender essential oil, they also have a calming, therapeutic effect—a great product to leave by your nightstand.

"I love these wipes. I usually have makeup all over my hands," Mary said. "They're just naturally anti-bacterial lavender wipes. They're really good and have different scents.""They're so strong," added Chrissy. The scent comes from the lavender essential oil. Herban Essentials suggests that you can place a dry towelette in your pillow for a more restful sleep or in the dryer for lavender-scented clothes. The strong scent also repels bugs, so you may want to grab a bag for your next camping trip or tropical vacation.





Herban Essentials Lavender Bag, $16


The beauty professional also keeps Neutrogena Makeup Remover Cleansing Towelettes, which we rated #1 of makeup remover wipes, in her makeup bag. These wipes are great for taking off heavy makeup.


Love the skin you're in with the best facial wipes in town!

Jennifer France | Real Estate Agent Resources - Products and Programs - Wells Fargo

















































			    BSM Script Anchor
			

Products and ProgramsPrint     Wells Fargo offers one of the most extensive sets of financing options in the industry, including a variety of special loans and programs to help you meet more homebuyer needs. Our position of leadership and our strategic relationships allow us to provide special benefits to eligible members of qualifying groups. From low-down-payment options to Wells Fargo exclusive programs, such as the Union Plus® Mortgage program, you can be confident that your buyers have options that meet their needs.     Mortgage products    Consumer benefit programs       Jumbo loan options We are the nation's #1 jumbo mortgage lender with lending capability in all 50 states. Jumbo loans allow qualified buyers to finance loan amounts above maximum conforming limits, helping them take advantage of today's home prices and low interest rates. Consider our jumbo loans for your homebuyers in higher-priced housing markets, including those who have a goal of purchasing a second home, resort condo, or rental property. Jumbo loan amounts are typically available with a variety of terms, options, and benefits:  Fixed- and adjustable-rate loans and short-term loans at very competitive interest rates. Loan amounts up to $2 million; higher amounts may be available through Private Mortgage Banking. 10.01% down payment financing option with no mortgage insurance requirement. After making a lump-sum principal reduction of $20,000 or more 90 days after closing, buyers may be eligible to reduce their monthly mortgage payments by recasting, or re-amortizing, the loan. Buyers will have a lower monthly mortgage payment, but they may pay more interest over the full mortgage term than they would by making a principal reduction without using the recast option. Buyers can purchase with cash up-front and may be eligible to apply for a mortgage within 90 days of purchase. Expanded credit, debt, and loan-to-value guidelines for qualified customers. Relationship-based pricing, interest-only options, and portfolio lending services.  Contact your local home mortgage consultant to learn more.  Options for affluent buyers Our exclusive Private Mortgage Banking division serves affluent homebuyers with complex income or asset situations, offering:  Competitive financing options for primary, second, vacation, and investment properties with financing up to $6 million. A dedicated customer service line exclusive to Private Mortgage Banking clients. Local market experience to help affluent clients find options that complement their wealth-building strategies.  Show your clients that you are dedicated to supporting their specific situations.   Contact your local home mortgage consultant to learn more.     Low down payment options Wells Fargo Home Mortgage provides a variety of programs that allow for low-and-no-down payments, and other features to help more homebuyers achieve homeownership. Be sure your buyers talk to us to discuss loan amount, loan type, and property to ensure eligibility. Low 3% down payments With Wells Fargo's yourFirst MortgageSM program, your buyers can get a conventional fixed-rate mortgage with a 3% down payment. Plus, there are no area median income requirements and they can use gift funds and down payment assistance programs. FHA loans FHA loans are available in a variety of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate options, and have down payment options as low as 3.5%.  VA loans VA loans offer low- and no-down payment options for veterans and other borrowers who meet the eligibility requirements of the VA program.  Learn more    New construction financing With one of the most extensive product offerings in the industry, along with construction-friendly programs, we can consistently meet more of your buyers' needs. Our local home mortgage consultants and dedicated support teams stand ready to work with you and your buyers every step of the way. Our popular Builder Lock OptionsSM allow homebuyers to lock in interest rates on new homes.   Our Builder Best® Extended Rate Lock program provides new construction buyers protection against rising interest rates. A non-refundable extended rate lock fee is required.      Condominium financing Condominium financing can be a confusing topic for developers, sales professionals, and borrowers alike. We stand committed to helping all navigate the complexities of condominium financing.    Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are two of the most popular loan types. Both options are available for conventional conforming loan amounts, jumbo (non-conforming) loan amounts, and FHA or VA programs. Fixed-rate mortgage A fixed-rate mortgage carries the same interest rate and monthly principal and interest payments for the life of the loan, which protects your homebuyers from rising interest rates and allows them to budget their monthly mortgage payments more easily. This loan type may be a good choice for your buyers who plan to stay in their homes for a long time. Adjustable-rate mortgage An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has the same interest rate and principal and interest payments a defined initial period, then adjusts annually when that initial period is over. Typically, ARMs have a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate mortgages. After the initial fixed period, your buyer's rates and payments may increase. This loan type may be a good option for your buyers who plan to move or refinance within a few years.       Union Plus® Mortgage program Home financing for union families Active and retired members of participating labor unions, their parents, and their children may be able to take advantage of special benefits through the Union Plus® Mortgage program, with financing provided by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are millions of active members today. Show your clients the benefits of the Union Plus® Mortgage program  $500 award for buying a home. When members, their parents, and their children finance their home with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, we'll send them a special My Mortgage GiftSM award after closing — for use at participating retailers. Mortgage payment assistance. Union Plus provides grants and interest-free mortgage assistance loans to eligible borrowers in the event of an unexpected loss of income — and the first $1,000 doesn't need to be repaid.  Wells Fargo Home Mortgage is proud to be the only home financing lender for the Union Plus Mortgage program.

Buyer eligibility includes:  Active duty personnel, reservists, veterans, members of the National Guard, or Department of Defense civilian employees VA eligibility PCS related moves  As one of the nation's leading VA lenders it is an honor to serve those who serve.  Talk to your local home mortgage consultant for eligibility details.
