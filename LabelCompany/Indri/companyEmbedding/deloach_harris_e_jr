From: The Duke EndowmentHarris
E. DeLoach Jr., chairman and chief executive officer at Sonoco Products Co. in
Hartsville, S.C., has been elected a Trustee of The Duke Endowment. 

"Through his distinguished business career and
extensive civic involvement, Harris DeLoach has dedicated himself to
strengthening his community,” said Neil Williams, the Endowment’s board chair.
"We welcome his perspective and expertise, and we’re pleased to add his voice
to our board.”

DeLoach was raised in Columbia,
S.C., and received his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of
South Carolina. After practicing
law in Hartsville for 13 years, DeLoach began a career at Sonoco in 1986 when
he was named vice president of administration and general counsel. After
serving in leadership roles throughout the company, he joined Sonoco’s Board of
Directors in 1998. He was named president and CEO in 2000, and was elected chairman
of the board in 2005. He also serves on
the Board of Directors of Progress Energy, Inc.; Goodrich Corp.; and Milliken
& Co.

DeLoach has served as attorney for the City of Hartsville
and as chairman of the Hartsville Rotary Club, Greater Hartsville Chamber of
Commerce and Darlington County Bar Association. He was a member of the
Darlington County School Board, the Bank of America Advisory Board (Hartsville)
and he served on the Board of Directors for the Bank of Hartsville. The
recipient of an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Coker College, DeLoach was
chairman of Coker’s Board of Trustees and he received the college’s Algernon
Sydney Sullivan Award. In addition, he was chairman of the Thomas Hart Academy
Board of Directors and the Byerly Hospital and Byerly Foundation Board of
Trustees, and he is the past chairman of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce
and The Palmetto Business Forum.

DeLoach was inducted into the South
Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 2010 and was named Business Person of the
Year in 2008 by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce. His numerous honors include the
Rotary Citizen of the Year Award, the Townes Award by South Carolina’s Governor’s
School for Science and Math, the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Moore
School of Business at the University of South Carolina, and the University of
South Carolina Distinguished Alumni Award.

He and his wife, Louise, of Conway,
S.C., have three children and six grandchildren. 

Based in
Charlotte, N.C., and established in 1924 by N.C. industrialist and
philanthropist James B. Duke, The Duke Endowment is the largest private
foundation in the Southeast. Since the Endowment’s founding, it has awarded $2.9 billion in grants in South Carolina
and North Carolina. The Endowment shares
a name with Duke University and Duke Energy, but all are separate
organizations.

Sonoco Names Jack Sanders as Chief Executive Officer, Harris DeLoach to Retire in April






Jack Sanders




Dec. 3, 2012 - Sonoco announced today that M. Jack Sanders will become president and chief executive officer of the Company, effective April 1, 2013, when Harris E. DeLoach Jr. retires as an active employee after more than 27 years with Sonoco.

Sanders also was elected to Sonoco's Board of Directors, effective immediately, increasing the board to 13 members, Sonoco said.

Sanders, 59, is currently president and chief operating officer of Sonoco.







Harris DeLoach




DeLoach, 68, is currently chairman and chief executive officer and has served as CEO since July 2000. He has been a member of Sonoco's Board of Directors since 1998 and chairman of the Board of Directors since 2005 and will remain its executive chairman following his retirement on March 31, 2013 .

A graduate of Louisiana State University with a Bachelor of Science in finance, Sanders joined Sonoco in 1988 as national sales and marketing manager for the company's Reels business. In 1992, he was asked to build and lead the development of Sonoco's new Protective Packaging business as its general manager. He was promoted in 1998 to division vice president and general manager of Protective Packaging. 

Sanders was elected a corporate officer and named vice president, Industrial Products, North America , in 2001. He was subsequently named vice president, Global Industrial products in January 2006 and assumed responsibility for all industrial converting businesses as senior vice president in July 2007. In 2008, Sanders was named executive vice president, Industrial, with global operating responsibility for all of the Company's businesses serving industrial markets, including Sonoco's tubes and cores, paper, reels, protective packaging, paperboard specialties and recycling businesses. Prior to assuming his current position, Sanders served as the executive vice president of Sonoco's Global Consumer businesses, where he was responsible for Rigid Paper and Closures, Rigid Plastics, Flexible Packaging and Display and Packaging.
 
DeLoach started his career as an attorney in Hartsville, South Carolina, where Sonoco was one of his clients. He officially joined the company in 1986 as vice president of administration and general counsel. In 1990, he was named vice president of Sonoco's High Density Film Products Division. In 1993, DeLoach was named vice president of Film, Plastics and Special Products before being promoted to group vice president in October of that year. Over the next decade, he continued to move into higher leadership positions and became president and chief operating officer in 2000, before taking over as CEO in July 2000.

In addition to the Sonoco Board of Directors, DeLoach currently serves on boards of Duke Energy and Milliken & Company as well as a trustee of the Duke Endowment and The Palmetto Institute Board. He also has served on the boards of directors of several other public companies and chaired numerous business and industry associations.
