George Campbell served as president of The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art from July, 2000 through June, 2011, and upon retirement was elected President Emeritus by the Board of Trustees. During Dr. Campbell’s tenure, Cooper Union, replaced 40 percent of its academic space, substantially renovated the remaining 60 percent, reduced the campus carbon footprint by 40 percent[2] and grew its endowment from $100 million to more than $600 million.[3] Celebrated by architecture critics as one of the decade’s great buildings, it is among the first science buildings to be awarded Platinum LEEDs Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council for its design although most of the green building designs were never implemented. Among the prestigious awards the building received are the MASterworks Award, Best New Building; Municipal Art Society’s, Green Building Design Award; Global Green USA, Honor Award; American Institute of Architects, Design Award; American Institute of Architects California Council, International Architecture Award; Chicago Anthenaeum, Energy Performance+Architecture Award; interclima+elec, Project of the Year: Green Building; New York Construction Best of 2009 Award, Creating Stellar Architecture Citation; American Institute of Architects National Technology in Architectural Practice, Building Information Model, Architecture Design Award; American Institute of Architects.
Equally important, under Dr. Campbell's leadership the college enhanced its national and international recognition as one of the leading institutions of higher education[citation needed] . Among the various surveys and polls, the college was ranked first by U.S. News & World Report among regional colleges in the Northeast and the Most Desirable College in the small college category by Newsweek/Kaplan (seventh among all of the nation's colleges and universities). Many other national and international rankings consistently placed Cooper Union among the best academically.
Previously Campbell was the president and CEO of NACME, Inc., a non-profit corporation focused on engineering education and science and technology policy. Additionally he spent twelve years at AT&T Bell Laboratories, served as a U.S. delegate to the International Telecommunications Union, served on the faculties of Nkumbi International College Zambia, and Syracuse University. He has published papers in mathematical physics, high-energy physics, satellite systems, digital communications, science and technology policy and science education and is co-editor of Access Denied: Race, Ethnicity and the Scientific Enterprise, Oxford University Press ISBN 0-19-510774-8. He has served on a number of national policy boards, including the United States Secretary of Energy Board and the Morella Commission of the U.S. Congress.
As an undergraduate, Dr. Campbell was a Simon Guggenheim Scholar and member of the national physics honor society. Among his awards are the 1993 George Arents Pioneer Medal in Physics, the Drexel University Centennial Medal, as an inaugural a member of the Drexel 100, the Leon J. Obermeyer Award from the City of Philadelphia Board of Education and several honorary doctorates. He has been elected to the Alumni Hall of Fame at Syracuse University and at the prestigious Central High School of Philadelphia. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the New York Academy of Sciences.
Campbell currently serves on the Board of Directors of Consolidated Edison, Inc and Barnes and Noble, Inc. He is also on the Board of Trustees of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, MITRE Corporation, Montefiore Medical Center, the Josiah Macy Foundation, the United States Naval Academy Foundation and is chairman of the board of trustees at Webb Institute. He is noted as having said that "at a place like Webb, everyone is admitted on an equal footing. When you remove the financial aspect of the college conversation and everyone understands that their peers are there on the same basis -- there's no questioning or doubting whether anyone belongs. There's a trust. This particular culture is very rare in higher education today.".[4]
Cooper Union controversy and investigation by New York state Attorney General[edit]
In the wake of the college's recent financial difficulties that led to the School dismantling its 150 year mission of free tuition, many faculty, students and alumni questioned Campbell's actions and intentions as President. According to John Hechinger in 2009, George Campbell helped the school sidestep a crisis.[5] Although by October 31, 2011 Jamshed Bharucha announced an insurmountable deficit that allegedly could not keep the institution sustainable without tuition, in May 2013 former Board of Trustees investment committee chair John Michaelson admitted the school could have continued to use the endowment to cover deficits and would have survived until 2018, when the higher payments from the Chrysler lease start.[6]
In an investigation of Cooper Union's finances released in a cross petition on September 2, 2015, New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman found that "President Campbell misinformed the community as to the strength of Cooper Union’s finances, when they had sufficient information to know the truth of the school’s increasingly dire condition." Additionally, Schneiderman found that Campbell had an "apparent conflict of interest" in a $175,000 bonus that would to be awarded George Campbell Jr., if construction of the New Academic Building at 41 Cooper Square was completed while he was President.[7][8]
The investigation concluded that the Schools financial difficulties in fact had happened under Campbell's presidency and planning: "The Attorney General’s financial and operational investigation, which began in August 2014 and the results of which are being released today, revealed that Cooper Union’s current financial problems are rooted in the failure of a 2006 plan to finance the construction of a new academic building at 41 Cooper Square. The plan involved the school taking out a $175 million mortgage loan on the land it owns beneath the Chrysler Building, while simultaneously committing to a long-term renegotiation of its lease with the tenant that owns and operates the building."[9]
Personal life[edit]
Married since 1968 to Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, President of Spelman College and dean emerita of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. Campbell and his wife have three sons and live in Atlanta, GA.

George Campbell Jr.

born: 
place: 
predoctoral instiution: B.S. Drexel University
in physics
doctoral institution: Ph.D. from Syracuse University
in physics
current employment. President of Cooper Union
University (New York City). Dr. Campbell currently serves on the
President's Information Technology Advisory Committee's Socio-Economic
and Workforce Panel, the Congressional Commission on the Advancement
of Women and Minorities in Science and the Engineering Advisory
Council of Cooper Union.
While pursuing his doctorate, George Campbell
Jr. drove an old, beat-up car and lived in a modest apartment.
His friends, some of whom had gone directly into the workforce
after earning a bachelor's degree, were taking ski vacations while
Campbell watched free movies on campus. His friends often teased
him about getting a job, but the jokes ended when Campbell earned
a Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Syracuse University.
In addition, he is a graduate of the Executive
Management Program at Yale University. He has been awarded the
Drexel University Centennial Medal, the Arents Pioneer Medal in
Physics from Syracuse University and the Synthesis Medallion from
the National Engineering Education Coalition. As an undergraduate,
he was a Simon Guggenheim Scholar and earned membership in the
national physics honor society. Currently, he is a member of the
President's Circle of the National Academy of Sciences, National
Academy of Engineering and Institute of Medicine. Married for
30 years to Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell,
dean of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, he and
his wife have three sons and live in Harlem New York. One son
is Garikai Campbell
who has a Ph.D. in Mathematics and is a Professor at Swarthmore.
Earlier in his career, Dr. Campbell served
on the faculties of Syracuse University and Nkumbi International
College in Zambia. Campbell has conducted research in theoretical
high energy physics and in magnetospheric physics.



During twelve years at AT&T Bell Laboratories,
      he held various R&D and management positions, and was a member
      of the Bell Labs Leadership Continuity group. In the 1970s, he
      was part of the team that developed the third generation of communications
      satellites, and from 1985 through 1988, he led a Bell Labs team
      in a groundbreaking international research and development collaboration
      with Kokusal Denshin Denwa (KDD) of Japan and British Telecom
      international. in satellite and international telecommunications
      technology development and served as a United States delegate
      to the International Telecommunications Union. He has published
      papers in mathematical and high energy physics, telecommunications,
      and science and technology policy.
Since 1989, George Campbell has been president
      and CEO of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering,
      Inc. (NACME) http://www.nacme.org/
      a non-profit corpor-ation that-- conducts research and public
      policy
      analysis, publishes original educa-tional materials and develops
      and operates comprehensive scholarship and academic enrich-ment
      programs in engineering, targeting economically disadvantaged
      students, largely from underrepresented
      minority groups. Under Dr. Campbell's leadership, public support
      of NACME has grown from $3.6 million in 1988 to almost $9.0 million
      in 1999. Widely recognized as leader of the national effort to
      increase access to careers in science-based fields, NACME received
      a U.S. Presidential Award for Excellence in 1996 and the U.S.
      Department of Labor's EPIC Award for Exemplary Public Interest
      Contribution in 1998.
During his tenure at NACME, Campbell gained
      national prominence as an advocate for both quality and equality
      in science, mathematics and engineering education. Under his
      leadership, the organization developed new processes for identifying
      students with academic promise. NACME is the nation's largest
      private source of scholarships for minorities in engineering,
      having supported ten percent of all African American, Latino
      and American Indian engineers who have graduated since 1980.
      As president and CEO, Dr. Campbell elevated public policy to
      a central place in the organization's functions, providing frequent
      advice to the White House Office of Scientific and Technology
      Policy, the National Science and Technology Council, the U.S.

Biography  |




 Interview Date:  5/17/2001 
 College president, nonprofit chief executive and physicist Dr. George Campbell, Jr. was born on December 2, 1945 in Richmond, Virginia to Lillian and George Campbell. Campbell graduated with his B.S. degree in physics in 1968 from Drexel University, where he was a Guggenheim Scholar. Campbell went on to study at Syracuse University, where he received his Ph.D. degree in theoretical physics and began working in academic positions at Syracuse University and later at Nkumbi International College in Zambia. Here, he taught physics and conducted research.  
Soon thereafter, Campbell left to take a position at AT&T Bell Laboratories, where he would stay for the next twelve years, occupying various research and design and management positions.  During his time at Bell Labs, Campbell helped develop the third generation of telecommunication satellites and served as a United States delegate to the International Telecommunications Union. After his tenure at Bell Labs, Campbell became president and CEO of the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering (NACME), a nonprofit organization designed to open doors of opportunity for young people interested in the field of engineering. Under Campbell's leadership, NACME's public funding nearly tripled and the organization was recognized with a U.S. Presidential Award for Excellence.  In July 2000, Oxford University Press published "Access Denied:  Race, Ethnicity and Scientific Enterprise," which Dr. Campbell co-edited.
On July 1, 2000, Campbell returned to academia when he became the first African American president of Cooper Union, a private university in New York City. 
The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Campbell and his wife, Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell, the Dean of New York University's Tisch School of Arts, raised three sons, the eldest of whom, Garikai, is a professor of Mathematics and Acting Dean of Students at Swarthmore College. 
George Campbell Jr. was interviewed by The HistoryMakers on May 17, 2001.
