      ■ Alan J. Lacy climbed the ranks at Sears, Roebuck, and Company in
      six years to become the chief executive officer (CEO) in 2000. During the
      late 1990s Sears began to struggle to maintain its hold in the world of
      department stores, fighting a troubled economy and negative press
      regarding its customer practices. Lacy's reputation within the
      company and industry were established with the growth of Sears's
      credit services while he served as the chief financial officer. Even
      though analysts noted his youth and lack of retail experience upon his
      appointment as CEO, Lacy soon established himself as a leader who made
      major changes, such as lowering costs by slashing jobs and eliminating
      unprofitable categories. Establishing a new brand for Sears eliminated at
      least eight apparel suppliers and purchasing the prestigious Lands'
      End clothing line brought a more affluent type of customer to Sears.

      EARLY YEARS SPENT IN THE SOUTH
    

      Lacy was born in Cleveland, Tennessee, a small city set against the
      backdrop of the foothills of the Smokey Mountains. His childhood in
      Cleveland gave him the background necessary to work long hours and succeed
      in business. His father was a vice president of finance at a local
      department store, and Lacy credited his father's and the
      town's beliefs in hard work and strong family values as major
      influences on his career.
    

      After graduating from Cleveland High School in 1971, he went to Atlanta to
      study at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He hoped to become a
      chemical engineer, but he soon realized he leaned more toward business
      than a chemistry lab. In 1975 he earned a bachelor's degree in
      Industrial Management. He continued with graduate studies at Emory
      University,
       earning an MBA in 1977. His first job upon graduation was as a financial
      analyst with Holiday Inns in Memphis, Tennessee. He spent the next 17
      years moving around the country serving in various financial positions
      with companies such as Kraft Foods and Phillip Morris before joining Sears
      in 1994 as the senior vice president of finance.
    

      ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL SUCCESS AT SEARS
    

      Lacy was named chief financial officer in 1995. Shortly thereafter the CEO
      of Sears, Arthur Martinez, called on Lacy to help solve a problem.
      According to Martinez's book 
      
        The Hard Road to the Softer Side
      
      , a Sears customer testified in a Boston federal court in 1997 that he was
      having difficulty making payments after filing bankruptcy. The judge told
      him that by filing bankruptcy he had discharged his debts, but the
      customer said he had an agreement with Sears to pay them back in monthly
      installments. The judge chastised Sears in court, and Martinez and his top
      advisors, including Lacy, agreed to a $273 million settlement agreement
      with the 190,000 Sears credit-card holders who had been forced to repay
      their credit-card debt after declaring bankruptcy.
    

      In 1997 Lacy was appointed to head of the credit division as Sears
      struggled with the losses associated with the lawsuit. In 1999 he was
      named president of services, including home services, direct responses,
      and e-commerce. By the time of his appointment as CEO in 2000, Lacy had
      made each of these divisions a profitable part of the Sears's team.
    

      TENURE AS CEO
    

      After Lacy's appointment as CEO, industry observers noted that he
      had always had the inside track for the top job because of his success in
      turning the credit department at Sears into the leading profit department
      within the company. Steven Kernkraut, a retail analyst at Bear Stearns,
      told 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       that Lacy's appointment was "a positive step. The
      appointment provides a follow-through with someone who has worked in the
      trenches and who has earned it" (September 12, 2000). Martinez
      claimed that after his retirement only Lacy and one other Sears employee
      were even considered for the position. The company did a nationwide
      search, but Lacy remained as the top selection. Insiders noted
      Lacy's relatively young age (46) but admitted that he had proven
      himself as a leader. They praised his expertise as a troubleshooter in the
      credit department, but noted that he did not have experience in
      merchandising.
    

      Some in the industry wondered if Lacy would be able to handle the rigors
      of running a $50 billion company—the third largest retailer in the
      United States by 2000, behind only Wal-Mart and Home Depot. In addition,
      Sears reigned as the leader in appliance sales, with its Kenmore brand as
      one of the most recognizable in the United States. Hal Reiter of Herbert
      Mines Associates, an executive search firm, said Lacy's lack of
      retail experience did not mean the apparel part of the business would
      suffer. "It's pretty clear that Lacy was the leading
      internal candidate," he told 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       (September 12, 2000). "But all signs indicate that he's a
      very capable leader and general manager, the traits necessary for any
      senior executive, particularly one with a huge company."
    

      Reiter concluded that experience in running a store was not necessarily
      needed. Others agreed with him, noting that Martinez had a similar
      background in finance and operations rather than merchandising. Many
      watched carefully, however, as Lacy made his first moves as CEO. The
      apparel line at Sears had been revamped under Martinez in the 1990s, with
      questionable success. Lacy said that turning around that section of the
      company would lead his list of priorities. He announced that he would work
      to improve the quality of apparel while reducing the number of suppliers.
      He also emphasized his commitment to Sears.com, which had become one of
      the most successful Web sites run by a traditional retailer.
    

      STRATEGIC CHANGES AS CEO
    

      Lacy announced that he would streamline the company while boosting
      revenues. Sears's stock in 2000 needed help; it had fallen from $60
      a share in 1998 to $35 a share. Lacy said that the key to success for
      Sears lay in doing "fewer things better." He stated that
      Sears would begin strengthening its customer relationships by learning
      more about who bought from Sears. He wanted the rest of the company to
      follow the example set by the appliance division, which had a 38 percent
      market share and $5 billion in sales in 2000.
    

      The strongest operation within Sears when Lacy became CEO was the credit
      division, which accounted for half of Sears's profit in 2000. He
      grew this department through the issuance of credit cards that offered
      bonuses to frequent Sears shoppers. He also offered credit cards to
      customers who purchased big-ticket items but had not used a Sears credit
      card in the past. Analysts were generally pleased with Lacy's early
      performance, and they appreciated that he recognized that Sears's
      biggest challenge centered on its customers and understanding their needs.
    

      TAKING THE BEST OF THE OLD
    

      After spending a year assessing the company and making only minor changes,
      in October 2001 Lacy met in Chicago with Wall Street analysts to unveil
      his major plans. The plans, which did not garner much excitement, involved
      making Sears more like a discount store than the traditional department
      store it had been for over one hundred years. Lacy explained that he
      intended to keep the strengths of the company intact,
       emphasizing appliance and tool sales and selling these items on credit.
      Within one year Sears began to resemble major discounters such as Target
      and Kohl's by centralizing cash registers in all of its 860
      full-line stores. The checkouts did not resemble those found in stores
      such as Wal-Mart or Target with multilane exit cash registers. Within the
      self-service departments, registers were placed in the middle of the main
      aisle, rather than near the aisle as previously situated, giving customers
      a way to pay in a convenient, central location. Each of the self-service
      departments had its own full-service checkout, known in the industry as a
      cashwrap. Lacy also introduced a new look for Sears with simplified
      fixtures and signage.
    

      As Lacy began to make changes, rumors surfaced that he was planning to
      eliminate apparel completely. Late in 2001 he announced the introduction
      of a casual brand of clothing for women, men, and children. One analyst
      told 
      
        Chain Store Age
      
       that the new line resembled "yuppie weekend clothes"
      (December 2001). The Covington brand replaced eight brands previously sold
      by Sears, and it signaled Lacy's determination to introduce
      improved products into a customer-friendly shopping experience, which
      included widening the aisles. The plans called for the new brand to take
      over the space vacated by cosmetic counters, whose contracts all ended in
      2002.
    

      Convenient shopping ruled Lacy's decisions to increase profits for
      Sears. He announced in 2001 Sears's intention to keep departments
      with large merchandise, such as appliances and home electronics, fully
      staffed to help customers make their choices, while cutting service within
      the less complicated departments such as shoes and apparel. Industry
      analysts wondered if customers would be content with self-service and the
      lack of sales personnel. Lacy chose to concentrate on direct marketing,
      allowing Sears the ability to determine exactly who their customers were
      and to attract new consumers. He noted that while placing television and
      newspaper circulars appealed to existing customers, such advertisements
      did not provide the company with specific marketing information. Even as
      these changes went into effect, analysts admitted that Sears defied
      definition within the context of the traditional retail world. Offering
      appliances and hardware alongside apparel left the store in a category by
      itself.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE AND STRATEGIES
    

      Cost consciousness ruled many of the decisions made by Lacy at Sears, and
      Wall Street analysts felt comfortable with the strategies he employed. By
      the last quarter of 2001 profits began showing gains. Lacy's moves
      to turn Sears into more of a discount store began with lowering operating
      costs and developing more self-help departments, thus reducing sales
      personnel. Associates were stationed at cash registers rather than working
      on the floor helping customers find their purchases.
    

      Lacy terminated several efforts begun under Martinez. He quit expanding
      home services and closed all of Sears's HomeLife stores by 2001. In
      addition, he closed eighty-nine Sears-operated National Tire &
      Battery stores during his first year as CEO, and he announced the end of
      Sears's involvement with cosmetics. He also sold a pest-control
      business operated by Sears and scaled back on expansion within the Great
      Indoors stores, a Sears's home decorating superstore chain
      developed by Martinez. Lacy eliminated 4,900 jobs, or 22 percent of
      Sears's salaried staff, over an 18-month period in 2001 and 2002,
      and he hoped to cut $600 million off of Sears's annual expenses by
      2004. Even as analysts noted the measures to cut costs, they predicted
      that Lacy would need to do something to regain the market share Sears was
      losing as a result of the cutbacks.
    

      NEW ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIES
    

      Lacy had made decisions previously that signaled a change to a discount
      store in order to remain competitive with Kohl's and Target, two of
      the fastest growing discount stores in the industry. However, he announced
      in 2001 that he wanted Sears to be neither a department store nor a
      discount store but rather in a category by itself. By 2002 Lacy's
      changes had begun to show evidence in increased profits, and he announced
      that Sears had purchased the online and catalog apparel retailer
      Lands' End for $1.9 billion. Lands' End was noted for its
      upscale customer base, and the purchase signaled an attempt to bring a new
      type of customer into the newly revamped stores. Analysts worried that the
      cash purchase might negatively affect Sears's stock, but this fear
      did not last long as the stock price rose to $59 a share, the highest
      price since 1998.
    

      When Sears increased the amount of money set aside to counter unpaid
      credit card charges in October 2002, the concern again came to the
      surface. The increase in the reserves gave investors cause to worry
      because it signaled higher than anticipated charge card write offs. 
      
        Crain's Chicago Business
      
       reported that changes in executives, a rewriting of account statements,
      and the large amount of credit card debts sent stock plummeting below $20,
      the lowest point in a decade (December 16, 2002). Lacy reacted by putting
      a new management team in charge of the retail portion of Sears and hiring
      executives to run store operations so he could concentrate on the
      department he had once before saved.
    

      In October 2002 Lacy fired Kevin Keleghan, president of credit and
      financial products, and the following month Keleghan sued Sears and Lacy
      for defamation. The lawsuit claimed that Lacy made public false statements
      about Keleghan, blaming him for the credit-card division's
      problems. Lacy startled industry insiders when he sold the credit-card
      business in 2003, which meant that the retail part of the business would
      now have to stand alone in increasing profits for Sears.
    

      STRATEGIES PUT TO THE TEST
    

      In 2002 Lacy told 
      
        DSN Retailing Today
      
       that Sears was a "broadline retailer with outstanding credit and
      service capabilities." By the end of 2003, however, the bold
      strategies employed by Lacy had failed to meet expectations for earnings,
      and he was rebuked by Sears's board of directors, who slashed his
      bonus by 50 percent and voted not to give him a raise. According to 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
      , "Lacy's 2003 target bonus was based on two factors: a
      pre-approved target level of improvement in the company's earnings
      per share and achievement of key strategic initiatives" (March 23,
      2004). The article stated that although he had achieved the strategies
      established by the board, he had not met a pre-established and undisclosed
      target for earnings per share.

      ■ Alan J. Lacy climbed the ranks at Sears, Roebuck, and Company in
      six years to become the chief executive officer (CEO) in 2000. During the
      late 1990s Sears began to struggle to maintain its hold in the world of
      department stores, fighting a troubled economy and negative press
      regarding its customer practices. Lacy's reputation within the
      company and industry were established with the growth of Sears's
      credit services while he served as the chief financial officer. Even
      though analysts noted his youth and lack of retail experience upon his
      appointment as CEO, Lacy soon established himself as a leader who made
      major changes, such as lowering costs by slashing jobs and eliminating
      unprofitable categories. Establishing a new brand for Sears eliminated at
      least eight apparel suppliers and purchasing the prestigious Lands'
      End clothing line brought a more affluent type of customer to Sears.

      EARLY YEARS SPENT IN THE SOUTH
    

      Lacy was born in Cleveland, Tennessee, a small city set against the
      backdrop of the foothills of the Smokey Mountains. His childhood in
      Cleveland gave him the background necessary to work long hours and succeed
      in business. His father was a vice president of finance at a local
      department store, and Lacy credited his father's and the
      town's beliefs in hard work and strong family values as major
      influences on his career.
    

      After graduating from Cleveland High School in 1971, he went to Atlanta to
      study at the Georgia Institute of Technology. He hoped to become a
      chemical engineer, but he soon realized he leaned more toward business
      than a chemistry lab. In 1975 he earned a bachelor's degree in
      Industrial Management. He continued with graduate studies at Emory
      University,
       earning an MBA in 1977. His first job upon graduation was as a financial
      analyst with Holiday Inns in Memphis, Tennessee. He spent the next 17
      years moving around the country serving in various financial positions
      with companies such as Kraft Foods and Phillip Morris before joining Sears
      in 1994 as the senior vice president of finance.
    

      ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL SUCCESS AT SEARS
    

      Lacy was named chief financial officer in 1995. Shortly thereafter the CEO
      of Sears, Arthur Martinez, called on Lacy to help solve a problem.
      According to Martinez's book 
      
        The Hard Road to the Softer Side
      
      , a Sears customer testified in a Boston federal court in 1997 that he was
      having difficulty making payments after filing bankruptcy. The judge told
      him that by filing bankruptcy he had discharged his debts, but the
      customer said he had an agreement with Sears to pay them back in monthly
      installments. The judge chastised Sears in court, and Martinez and his top
      advisors, including Lacy, agreed to a $273 million settlement agreement
      with the 190,000 Sears credit-card holders who had been forced to repay
      their credit-card debt after declaring bankruptcy.
    

      In 1997 Lacy was appointed to head of the credit division as Sears
      struggled with the losses associated with the lawsuit. In 1999 he was
      named president of services, including home services, direct responses,
      and e-commerce. By the time of his appointment as CEO in 2000, Lacy had
      made each of these divisions a profitable part of the Sears's team.
    

      TENURE AS CEO
    

      After Lacy's appointment as CEO, industry observers noted that he
      had always had the inside track for the top job because of his success in
      turning the credit department at Sears into the leading profit department
      within the company. Steven Kernkraut, a retail analyst at Bear Stearns,
      told 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       that Lacy's appointment was "a positive step. The
      appointment provides a follow-through with someone who has worked in the
      trenches and who has earned it" (September 12, 2000). Martinez
      claimed that after his retirement only Lacy and one other Sears employee
      were even considered for the position. The company did a nationwide
      search, but Lacy remained as the top selection. Insiders noted
      Lacy's relatively young age (46) but admitted that he had proven
      himself as a leader. They praised his expertise as a troubleshooter in the
      credit department, but noted that he did not have experience in
      merchandising.
    

      Some in the industry wondered if Lacy would be able to handle the rigors
      of running a $50 billion company—the third largest retailer in the
      United States by 2000, behind only Wal-Mart and Home Depot. In addition,
      Sears reigned as the leader in appliance sales, with its Kenmore brand as
      one of the most recognizable in the United States. Hal Reiter of Herbert
      Mines Associates, an executive search firm, said Lacy's lack of
      retail experience did not mean the apparel part of the business would
      suffer. "It's pretty clear that Lacy was the leading
      internal candidate," he told 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
       (September 12, 2000). "But all signs indicate that he's a
      very capable leader and general manager, the traits necessary for any
      senior executive, particularly one with a huge company."
    

      Reiter concluded that experience in running a store was not necessarily
      needed. Others agreed with him, noting that Martinez had a similar
      background in finance and operations rather than merchandising. Many
      watched carefully, however, as Lacy made his first moves as CEO. The
      apparel line at Sears had been revamped under Martinez in the 1990s, with
      questionable success. Lacy said that turning around that section of the
      company would lead his list of priorities. He announced that he would work
      to improve the quality of apparel while reducing the number of suppliers.
      He also emphasized his commitment to Sears.com, which had become one of
      the most successful Web sites run by a traditional retailer.
    

      STRATEGIC CHANGES AS CEO
    

      Lacy announced that he would streamline the company while boosting
      revenues. Sears's stock in 2000 needed help; it had fallen from $60
      a share in 1998 to $35 a share. Lacy said that the key to success for
      Sears lay in doing "fewer things better." He stated that
      Sears would begin strengthening its customer relationships by learning
      more about who bought from Sears. He wanted the rest of the company to
      follow the example set by the appliance division, which had a 38 percent
      market share and $5 billion in sales in 2000.
    

      The strongest operation within Sears when Lacy became CEO was the credit
      division, which accounted for half of Sears's profit in 2000. He
      grew this department through the issuance of credit cards that offered
      bonuses to frequent Sears shoppers. He also offered credit cards to
      customers who purchased big-ticket items but had not used a Sears credit
      card in the past. Analysts were generally pleased with Lacy's early
      performance, and they appreciated that he recognized that Sears's
      biggest challenge centered on its customers and understanding their needs.
    

      TAKING THE BEST OF THE OLD
    

      After spending a year assessing the company and making only minor changes,
      in October 2001 Lacy met in Chicago with Wall Street analysts to unveil
      his major plans. The plans, which did not garner much excitement, involved
      making Sears more like a discount store than the traditional department
      store it had been for over one hundred years. Lacy explained that he
      intended to keep the strengths of the company intact,
       emphasizing appliance and tool sales and selling these items on credit.
      Within one year Sears began to resemble major discounters such as Target
      and Kohl's by centralizing cash registers in all of its 860
      full-line stores. The checkouts did not resemble those found in stores
      such as Wal-Mart or Target with multilane exit cash registers. Within the
      self-service departments, registers were placed in the middle of the main
      aisle, rather than near the aisle as previously situated, giving customers
      a way to pay in a convenient, central location. Each of the self-service
      departments had its own full-service checkout, known in the industry as a
      cashwrap. Lacy also introduced a new look for Sears with simplified
      fixtures and signage.
    

      As Lacy began to make changes, rumors surfaced that he was planning to
      eliminate apparel completely. Late in 2001 he announced the introduction
      of a casual brand of clothing for women, men, and children. One analyst
      told 
      
        Chain Store Age
      
       that the new line resembled "yuppie weekend clothes"
      (December 2001). The Covington brand replaced eight brands previously sold
      by Sears, and it signaled Lacy's determination to introduce
      improved products into a customer-friendly shopping experience, which
      included widening the aisles. The plans called for the new brand to take
      over the space vacated by cosmetic counters, whose contracts all ended in
      2002.
    

      Convenient shopping ruled Lacy's decisions to increase profits for
      Sears. He announced in 2001 Sears's intention to keep departments
      with large merchandise, such as appliances and home electronics, fully
      staffed to help customers make their choices, while cutting service within
      the less complicated departments such as shoes and apparel. Industry
      analysts wondered if customers would be content with self-service and the
      lack of sales personnel. Lacy chose to concentrate on direct marketing,
      allowing Sears the ability to determine exactly who their customers were
      and to attract new consumers. He noted that while placing television and
      newspaper circulars appealed to existing customers, such advertisements
      did not provide the company with specific marketing information. Even as
      these changes went into effect, analysts admitted that Sears defied
      definition within the context of the traditional retail world. Offering
      appliances and hardware alongside apparel left the store in a category by
      itself.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE AND STRATEGIES
    

      Cost consciousness ruled many of the decisions made by Lacy at Sears, and
      Wall Street analysts felt comfortable with the strategies he employed. By
      the last quarter of 2001 profits began showing gains. Lacy's moves
      to turn Sears into more of a discount store began with lowering operating
      costs and developing more self-help departments, thus reducing sales
      personnel. Associates were stationed at cash registers rather than working
      on the floor helping customers find their purchases.
    

      Lacy terminated several efforts begun under Martinez. He quit expanding
      home services and closed all of Sears's HomeLife stores by 2001. In
      addition, he closed eighty-nine Sears-operated National Tire &
      Battery stores during his first year as CEO, and he announced the end of
      Sears's involvement with cosmetics. He also sold a pest-control
      business operated by Sears and scaled back on expansion within the Great
      Indoors stores, a Sears's home decorating superstore chain
      developed by Martinez. Lacy eliminated 4,900 jobs, or 22 percent of
      Sears's salaried staff, over an 18-month period in 2001 and 2002,
      and he hoped to cut $600 million off of Sears's annual expenses by
      2004. Even as analysts noted the measures to cut costs, they predicted
      that Lacy would need to do something to regain the market share Sears was
      losing as a result of the cutbacks.
    

      NEW ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIES
    

      Lacy had made decisions previously that signaled a change to a discount
      store in order to remain competitive with Kohl's and Target, two of
      the fastest growing discount stores in the industry. However, he announced
      in 2001 that he wanted Sears to be neither a department store nor a
      discount store but rather in a category by itself. By 2002 Lacy's
      changes had begun to show evidence in increased profits, and he announced
      that Sears had purchased the online and catalog apparel retailer
      Lands' End for $1.9 billion. Lands' End was noted for its
      upscale customer base, and the purchase signaled an attempt to bring a new
      type of customer into the newly revamped stores. Analysts worried that the
      cash purchase might negatively affect Sears's stock, but this fear
      did not last long as the stock price rose to $59 a share, the highest
      price since 1998.
    

      When Sears increased the amount of money set aside to counter unpaid
      credit card charges in October 2002, the concern again came to the
      surface. The increase in the reserves gave investors cause to worry
      because it signaled higher than anticipated charge card write offs. 
      
        Crain's Chicago Business
      
       reported that changes in executives, a rewriting of account statements,
      and the large amount of credit card debts sent stock plummeting below $20,
      the lowest point in a decade (December 16, 2002). Lacy reacted by putting
      a new management team in charge of the retail portion of Sears and hiring
      executives to run store operations so he could concentrate on the
      department he had once before saved.
    

      In October 2002 Lacy fired Kevin Keleghan, president of credit and
      financial products, and the following month Keleghan sued Sears and Lacy
      for defamation. The lawsuit claimed that Lacy made public false statements
      about Keleghan, blaming him for the credit-card division's
      problems. Lacy startled industry insiders when he sold the credit-card
      business in 2003, which meant that the retail part of the business would
      now have to stand alone in increasing profits for Sears.
    

      STRATEGIES PUT TO THE TEST
    

      In 2002 Lacy told 
      
        DSN Retailing Today
      
       that Sears was a "broadline retailer with outstanding credit and
      service capabilities." By the end of 2003, however, the bold
      strategies employed by Lacy had failed to meet expectations for earnings,
      and he was rebuked by Sears's board of directors, who slashed his
      bonus by 50 percent and voted not to give him a raise. According to 
      
        Women's Wear Daily
      
      , "Lacy's 2003 target bonus was based on two factors: a
      pre-approved target level of improvement in the company's earnings
      per share and achievement of key strategic initiatives" (March 23,
      2004). The article stated that although he had achieved the strategies
      established by the board, he had not met a pre-established and undisclosed
      target for earnings per share.

Methodology:
Compensation rank is based on total compensation for latest fiscal year.
Efficiency rank is based on our chief executive's performance/pay score.
Ranks are given only to chief executives who have a six-year tenure and
six-year compensation history. The most efficient rank is 1 and least
efficient is 189.

Footnotes:
Total returns and value of stock owned (including all classes) is based
on Mar. 31, 2005 stock price. Compensation percent change is based on

Alan J. Lacy (born October 19, 1953) was the last Chairman and CEO of Sears, Roebuck and Company, which was acquired by Kmart in 2005, at which point he became Vice Chairman of that organization.
Early life and education[edit]
Lacy was born in Cleveland, Tennessee. He graduated from Cleveland High School in 1971. Lacy earned a BS in Industrial Management from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1975 and an MBA from Emory University in 1977.[1]
Career[edit]
Prior to Sears, Lacy was in senior management positions with Kraft Foods and its former parent company Altria Group. Lacy has also served as a director of The Western Union Company, Sears, Roebuck and Co., Sears Holdings Corporation, Sears Canada Inc., the Economic Club of Chicago, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the National Retail Federation. He has also served as a trustee of the Chicago Botanic Garden and the Field Museum of Natural History.
Lacy joined Sears in 1994 and served in a number of senior positions, including Chief Financial Officer, President-Credit and President-Services before being named CEO in 2000. He became CEO of Sears Holdings Corporation following the 2005 acquisition of Sears by Kmart Holdings and Vice Chairman prior to his departure in 2006.
In addition to the sale of Sears to Kmart, Lacy's accomplishments included the acquisition of Lands' End, the sale of Sears credit operation to Citigroup and significant restructuring actions. Despite the competitive challenges Sears faced during his tenure as CEO, Sears' share price significantly outperformed the overall market and a number of key competitors (e.g. Wal-Mart and Home Depot).
He is a member of the board of directors of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company[2] and a trustee of Fidelity Funds. He served as Chairman of the Board of Dave and Buster's Entertainment, Inc from 2014 to 2017. He is a former trustee and board Chair of the National Parks Conservation Association.[3][4] In addition, he was Senior Adviser to Oak Hill Capital Partners from 2007-2014.

Former Sears CEO selling pedigreed Lake Forest estate


The walled Lake Forest estate built by Edward Bennett, who co-authored the Plan of Chicago in 1909 and designed the Buckingham Fountain and Michigan Avenue bridge, is going up for sale today for the first time in 20 years. The sellers are Caron and Alan Lacy, the last chairman and CEO of Sears Roebuck before its 2005 sale to Kmart. Lacy retired as vice chairman of Sears in 2006."It's one of those great, classic Lake Forest estate houses,” Lacy said by phone from the couple's other home, in Carmel, Calif. “But other than some grand rooms on the first floor, it's not all that big, relatively, and it was a place where our two teenaged boys were allowed get rowdy.” Both sons are grown.The estate, with manicured grounds that include a fountain whose square-in-a-circle pool is a smaller version of Buckingham Fountain's, will be listed with Mona Hellinga of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices KoenigRubloff Realty Group. The asking price is $4.25 million. Dubbed "Bagatelle" by Bennett and originally a summer home, the estate stands on two acres on Deerpath Road near the center of Lake Forest. It includes three buildings: the main house and a coach house built in 1916 in the style of a French country house, and an artist's studio that Bennett drew up in the early 1930s in the Art Moderne style, similar to the look of the buildings he designed for the Century of Progress World's Fair on Chicago's lakefront in 1933. The main house has a checkerboard marble-floored foyer that leads to broad formal living and dining rooms, each with a screened porch attached, all visible on the listing site. Caron Lacy describes the core formal rooms as “a jewel box,” her husband said. The two rooms' rear walls are lined with French doors that open onto a raised terrace. Beyond it lies a long lawn that terminates at a classical statue called Flora, placed by Bennett “at the end of that view axis,” he said.

On the second floor, the three-room master suite and its porch look over the rear lawn. Also on the second floor are three other bedrooms originally designed for the Bennett family and several rooms intended for servants and used by the Lacys as computer and exercise rooms. The master bath, kitchen and adjacent pantry were updated in the 1990s.The coachhouse, which matches the house's creamy stucco walls and quoining (masonry blocks at the corner of a wall), has a two-bedroom apartment above a three-car garage. The studio, nestled beneath trees about 50 yards from the house, departs from the style, built of brick with a low-slung roof and rounded corners inside and out. Alan Lacy said his research on the property determined that the land for the estate was a gift from the father of Bennett's wife, born Catherine Jones, and construction costs came from her uncle. Her initials grace the wrought-iron balcony, the J being largest. As Lacy puts it, Bennett may have been beholden to his wife's wealthy family, but “he's back there in the studio, painting nude women.”

For about 40 years, Bagatelle was home to Henry Meers, a Merrill Lynch executive in Chicago and a philanthropist who headed the boards of Children's Memorial Hospital, WTTW-TV/Channel 11, the Latin School of Chicago and the Chicago Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America. The Lacys became the estate's sixth owners in 1995 when they did a house swap with Bagatelle's previous owners, John and Ingrid LoGuidice, giving that couple their previous home, which Alan Lacy now describes as “a project that turned out to be more than we could handle,” and some cash. Hellinga said the total transaction was valued at $2.725 million at that time. The Lacys later replaced the slate roof on the two front buildings, had the grounds re-landcaped and made other upgrades, she said. Alan Lacy said one original detail he never managed to re-create is a glass canopy extending about 25 feet from the front door out to the estate's gate on Deerpath Road. Although guests now mostly arrive via a gated side driveway on Green Bay Road, Lacy said, “arriving at the curb out front to walk in under that canopy must have been an elegant experience.”

Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
