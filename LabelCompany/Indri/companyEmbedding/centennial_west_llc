Welcome to the Centennial West Clean Line Website
Renewable energy provides Americans with jobs, clean air, and energy security. However, the continued growth of this burgeoning industry depends upon the expansion of the U.S. electric transmission grid. While the United States has some of the best renewable resources in the world, they are predominantly located in remote areas. The challenge lies in transporting the energy generated from these resources to communities that need the power—a challenge Clean Line Energy is working to solve.
Delivering clean energy to millions of homes
An effective transmission solution requires the appropriate technology and the right project. The Centennial West Clean Line will deliver 3,500 megawatts of the best renewable energy from New Mexico and Arizona to communities in California and other areas in the west that have a strong demand for clean, reliable energy. The clean energy will be transported via an approximately 900-mile overhead, direct current transmission (DC) line. Due to its low electricity losses and smaller footprint, DC transmission is the most efficient and cost effective technology to move large amounts of electricity over long distances.

WE’VE GOT YOU COVERED WITH RECLAIMED PANELS

Innovative architects and builders have installed our Reclaimed Wyoming Snow Fence to add texture, beauty and natural ambiance in both interior and exterior applications. Our reclaimed wood has been utilized in applications ranging from cutting edge modern residential and commercial structures to rustic mountain retreats. Discover new ways to incorporate this beautiful wood into your home and let it tell its unique story!

Product Specs
FROM FLOOR TO CEILING
Centennial Woods™ reclaims snowfence boards for use in exterior and interior applications. The harsh Wyoming wind and low humidity provide ideal air drying for the untreated boards. These conditions result in a beautifully weathered, high integrity, chemical free reclaimed wood product unaffected by ground moisture and bugs for your immediate, safe use.
All of our reclaimed wood products are available in their natural weathered grey state complete with nail heads. Alternatively, products are available de-nailed and surfaced to reveal fresh cut wood in combination with the beautiful patina or milled to fit your shiplap, tongue and groove or other application needs.
While our wood has high physical integrity when compared to barn wood and most other reclaimed wood products, it does contain checks, marks, knotholes, nail heads, and color variations, as well as the occasional warping typical of lumber. Please allow for these natural variations when planning the take-off for your application.
