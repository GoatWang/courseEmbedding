	Item 4.






	Information on the Company








	DESCRIPTION OF
	BUSINESS





	We believe that, as of December 31, 2008, we were Latin Americas largest forest plantation owner, and that we are
	Chiles largest exporter of forestry and wood products in terms of sales revenue. We have industrial operations in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately 948,369 hectares of plantations in Chile,
	Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. During 2008, we harvested 16.5 million cubic meters of sawlogs and pulplogs and sold 5,224,127 cubic meters of wood products, including sawn timber (green and kiln-dried lumber) and remanufactured wood products,
	and panels (plywood, medium density fiber board, or MDF, particle board, or PBO, and high density fiber board, or HB).




	Based on
	information published by Resource Information Systems, Inc., an independent research company for the pulp and paper industry, at December 31, 2008, we were one of the worlds largest producers of bleached and unbleached softwood kraft
	market pulp in terms of volume of pulp produced in 2008, with an estimated 5.3% share of the total world production of bleached softwood kraft market pulp and a 15.6% share of the total world production of softwood kraft market unbleached pulp.
	Market pulp is pulp sold to manufacturers of paper products, as opposed to pulp produced by an integrated paper producer for use in its paper production facilities. Kraft pulp is pulp produced using a chemical process.




	Based on information published by Resource Information Systems, Inc., we were also one of the worlds lowest-cost producers of
	softwood kraft market pulp. We believe that we are able to produce our products at a lower cost than our competitors because of the high growth rate and short harvest cycle of radiata pine compared to other commercial softwoods, the advanced genetic
	and silviculture techniques we apply in our forest management, our competitive labor costs, our modern mill facilities and the proximity of our operations to Pacific coast ports.

	History





	Celulosa Arauco y Constitución S.A. is a corporation (

	sociedad anónima

	) organized under the laws of Chile, and subject to the rules of the Chilean public corporations (

	sociedades
	anónimas abiertas

	). Our principal executive offices are located at Avenida El Golf 150, 14



	th



	Floor, Las Condes, Santiago, Chile, and our telephone number is +56-2-461-7200.




	We were formed on
	September 14, 1979 in a merger between Industrias de Celulosa Arauco S.A., or Industrias Arauco, and Celulosa Constitución S.A., or Celulosa Constitución. Our two predecessor companies were created in the late 1960s and early
	1970s by Corporación de Fomento de la Producción, or Corfo, a Chilean government development corporation, to develop forest resources, improve soil quality in former farming areas and promote employment. As part of the Chilean
	governments privatization program, Corfo sold Industrias Arauco to Compañía de Petróleos de Chile S.A., or Copec, in 1977 and Celulosa Constitución to Copec in 1979. In October 2003, Copec transferred all of its
	gasoline- and fuel-related business assets to a new subsidiary, and changed its legal name to Empresas Copec S.A., or Empresas Copec.

	See

	Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party TransactionsMajor Shareholders.




	In 1990, we founded Investigaciones Forestales Bioforest S.A., or Bioforest, to conduct applied research in genetic improvement, site
	productivity, pest and disease control and wood quality, with the goal of increasing the productivity of our forest resources. In 1990, we also began the construction of a second production line at the Arauco Mill, Arauco II, which was completed in
	1991. The construction of Arauco II cost approximately U.S.$600 million, which was, at that time, the largest investment in our history.




	In 1996, we acquired Alto Paraná S.A., an Argentine company, which, at that time, owned plantations and other land in Argentina and manufactured and sold bleached softwood kraft pulp. With this acquisition, we expanded our market
	opportunities outside of Chile.




	In 2000, we acquired 98% of the shares of Forestal Cholguán S.A., or Cholguán, and 50% of
	Trupán S.A., or Trupán, which permitted us to enter the MDF and HB markets, and in 2002, we began operations at two new MDF mills, one in Chile and one in Argentina.




	During 2003, we began construction of the first phase of the Nueva Aldea Project, a new forestry-industrial complex in the Eighth Region of Chile, which
	was completed during 2004.




	During 2004, we completed construction of the Valdivia Mill.




	During 2004, we also commenced construction of the second phase of the Nueva Aldea Project, which included the development of a new pulp mill with
	installed annual production capacity of 856,000 tons of bleached pulp, consisting of softwood pulp and eucalyptus pulp. We completed the construction and started production in August 2006 and in May 2007 the mill reached full capacity. Total capital
	expenditures related to the construction of the pulp mill in the Nueva Aldea Project as of December 31, 2008 amounted to approximately U.S.$841.3 million.

	See

	Item 4. Information on the CompanyDescription of the
	BusinessPulpPulp millsChile.




	On January 6, 2005, through Forestal Valdivia S.A., we acquired 80% of Forestal
	Los Lagos S.A., which represented an investment of U.S.$21.4 million and included 9,234 hectares of land planted with eucalyptus in what is now the Fourteenth Region of Chile.




	On March 9, 2005, we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S. 100% of the stock of LD Forest Products S.A., a forest company located in the Brazilian
	state of Paraná that owned 43,000 hectares of land, of which 25,800 hectares were forest plantations, and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of Placas do Paraná S.A., an industrial company that owns an MDF mill
	and a particleboard mill in Paraná, and 50% of the stock of Dynea Brasil S.A., which owns a mill that produces impregnated paper and a formaldehyde and resin plant in Paraná. We paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately
	U.S.$168.0 million for these acquisitions. With

	these acquisitions, we acquired an MDF mill in Brazil with installed annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 cubic meters, a particleboard mill
	with installed annual production capacity of approximately 320,000 cubic meters, an impregnated paper mill, a formaldehyde and resin plant and 25,800 hectares of plantations.




	On October 31, 2005, we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S., 100% of the stock of two holding companies in Argentina, Ecoboard S.A.I.F. and Louis
	Dreyfus S.A.I.F., and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of Caif S.A., a holding company that owns LD Manufacturing S.A. and 60% of the stock of Flooring S.A. As a result of these acquisitions, we own a particleboard mill
	with installed annual production capacity of approximately 260,000 cubic meters, a chemical plant that produces resins used for the production of wood panels, an MDF and particleboard-based wood floor mill with installed annual production capacity
	of approximately two million square meters, and an additional 8,000 hectares of plantations in Argentina. We paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately U.S.$55.0 million for this acquisition.




	On June 30, 2006, through our subsidiaries Aserraderos Arauco S.A., Forestal Celco S.A., Bosques Arauco S.A. and Forestal Valdivia S.A., we acquired
	the forestry assets of Cementos Bío-Bío S.A. The acquisition represented an investment of approximately U.S.$133.3 million. The acquired assets consisted of 21,000 hectares of pine plantations, one sawmill with an annual production
	capacity of approximately 250,000 cubic meters per year and a remanufacturing facility.




	During the last quarter of 2006, we commenced the
	construction of a second plywood line at the Nueva Aldea Complex, with a capacity of 225,000 cubic meters. We completed this project in March 2008 for a total cost of U.S.$51 million.




	In January 2007, through our subsidiary Bosques Arauco S.A., we acquired 5,105 hectares of radiata pine plantations from Forestal Anchile Ltda. This
	acquisition represented an investment of approximately U.S.$43.6 million.




	On September 27, 2007 we entered into an agreement for the
	joint ownership of land in Brazil with Stora Enso Oyj, a Finnish-Swedish multinational corporation. Pursuant to the agreement, we acquired 80% of the shares in Stora Enso Arapoti Empreendimentos Agrícolas S.A., now Arauco Florestal Arapoti
	S.A., which owns 50,000 hectares of land, including 25,000 hectares of pine and 5,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantations; 20% of the shares in Stora Enso Arapoti Indústria de Papel S.A., which owns a paper mill with an annual production
	capacity of 205,000 tons of light weight coated paper; and 100% of the shares of Stora Enso Arapoti Serraria Ltda. which owns a sawmill with an annual production capacity of 150,000 cubic meters per year. This alliance required an investment of
	U.S.$208.4 million, which was financed with our resources and commercial bank loans.




	In July 2008, through our subsidiary Forestal
	Valdivia S.A., we acquired U.S.$14 million worth of plantations from Lafarge Chile S.A.




	On May 17, 2009, our subsidiary Arauco
	International S.A. and a subsidiary of Stora Enso Oyj agreed in a joint venture partnership to acquire the Uruguayan subsidiaries of the Spanish Grupo Empresarial ENCE S.A. The companies to be acquired are Eufores S.A., Celulosa y Energía
	Punta Pereira S.A. and Zona Franca Punta Pereira S.A. The main assets of these subsidiaries include (i) 130,000 hectares of land located in the central and western zones of Uruguay (which include 73,000 hectares of plantation forests and 13,000
	hectares under covenants with third party owners, of which 7,000 hectares are planted) and (ii) industrial sites in Punta Pereira and MBopicuá, a river barge terminal, a woodchip mill and a forestry nursery. This joint acquisition
	represents a purchase of $343 million by Arauco and Stora Enso, where each party will equally invest $171.5 million. We expect to consummate this acquisition during the second half of 2009.




	On June 16, 2009, we submitted to the COREMA a request to increase our production by 20% in the Valdivia mill. If the request is approved, the
	Valdivia mill would increase its production from 550,000 metric tons per year to 660,000 metric tons per year, fully complying with current environmental regulations. The increase would be achieved through the optimization of our current production
	process, and does not require investments in additional equipment.

	Forestry Activity





	Radiata pine grows at the fastest rates within a narrow band of latitude and under certain climatic conditions. One of Chiles principal advantages in the forestry products industry lies in the short growing
	cycle of its radiata pine plantations. The faster rate of growth of radiata pine trees in Chile allows harvesting of pulplogs and sawlogs 16 to 18 years after planting and of high quality sawlogs 25 years after planting. For most temperate softwood
	forests in the Northern Hemisphere this range is 18 to 45 years for pulplogs and 50 to 150 years for high quality sawn timber. Consequently, the Chilean forestry industry is a relatively low cost producer, since a Chilean producer generally requires
	less time and a smaller area to produce the same volume of pine as its North American or European competitors, who face lower forest growth rates and higher transportation and investment costs as a result of the larger tracts of forests necessary to
	produce equivalent yields of softwood. Accordingly, since the mid-1970s, we have focused our forest management toward the application of advanced genetic and silviculture techniques to increase productivity and the quality of our plantations.




	Eucalyptus, which we started planting in 1989, grows well in the forest regions of Chile. Once planted, eucalyptus trees require no
	further forest management (other than fire control and reduction of weeds) until harvest. The average harvest cycle of eucalyptus plantations is approximately 12 years. Once cut, eucalyptus regrows and it is only after two additional harvest
	rotations of approximately 12 years each that it becomes necessary to replant.




	We have adopted environmentally sensitive policies towards
	our holdings of native forests. In selected areas, we thin native forests in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but we do not permit clear cutting of native forests in areas surrounding rivers and streams, areas of notable
	environmental interest or areas with particularly fragile soil conditions.

	Government Regulation.

	International Standards Organization, or ISO, has certified our forestry activities in Chile and Argentina pursuant to ISO 14001 through the year 2008. Additionally, during 2003, we obtained certification in Chile from the National Standard for
	Sustainable Forest Management (



	Estándar Nacional de Certificación Forestal Sustentable



	), or CERTFOR. Since 2004, CERTFOR has been a member of the Pan European Forest Certification, which is the worlds largest
	forest certification organization. CERTFOR has performed audits of our operations in 2004 and 2008, and has confirmed each time that we are in compliance with the applicable CERTFOR requirements. We received Occupational Health and Safety Assessment
	Series (OHSAS) certification in November 2005 with respect to our forestry activities in Argentina.








	Forest Plantations






	At December 31, 2008, our planted forests consisted of 83.2% radiata and taeda pine, and the balance primarily consisted of eucalyptus. Radiata and
	taeda pine have a rapid growth rate and a short harvest cycle compared to other commercial softwoods. Radiata and taeda pine are sufficiently versatile for both the production of forestry and wood products and the production of long fiber pulp for
	sale to manufacturers of paper and packaging.




	We seek to manage our forestry resources in a way that ensures that the annual growth of our
	forest is equal to or greater than the volume of resources harvested each year. In 2008, we planted 44,156 hectares and harvested 37,667 hectares in Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We believe that we will reach a long-term sustainable
	equilibrium within the next five years, with annual harvests and plantations of approximately 40,000 hectares.

	Table of Contents




	The majority of our radiata pine is less than 16 years old. Our planted radiata pine forests are located
	in central and southern Chile, and most are located in close proximity to our major production facilities and to port facilities.




	At
	December 31, 2008, our aggregate radiata pine holdings comprised approximately 40% of all Chilean radiata pine plantations, making us the countrys largest radiata pine plantation owner according to the Chilean Forestry Institute

	.

	At December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 1,090,627 hectares of land in Chile, of which 730,210 hectares are forest plantations.




	At December 31, 2008, we owned 256,082 hectares of forest and other land in Argentina, 122,659 hectares of forest and other land in Brazil and 39,373 hectares of forest and other land in Uruguay. Of the total land we own in these three
	countries, approximately 187,055 hectares of land is planted with taeda pine and elliotti pine, a species of softwood that has a growth rate similar to that of radiata pine. The balance includes plantations of other species of trees, land to be
	planted, protected areas and natural forests.




	The following table sets forth the number of hectares and types of uses of our land holdings
	and rights, as of December 31, 2008.

	Land Acquisition and Afforestation






	Our total land assets have increased from fewer than 170,000 hectares in 1980 to
	1,508,742 hectares at December 31, 2008. That number does not include 26,260 hectares owned by third parties or the assets owned by Forestal Río Grande S.A. as to which we have harvesting rights. In the five years ending
	December 31, 2008, we purchased 243,780 hectares of land, of which 69,158 hectares were purchased in Chile, 82,682 in Argentina, 82,510 in Brazil and 9,430 in Uruguay.




	We expect to acquire additional land in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, and to a lesser extent in Chile if we are presented with the opportunity to do so
	at a desired price or location. There can be no assurance that we would be able to acquire land at the desired price or location.




	We plan
	to continue our policy of supplementing our pulplog production with purchases from domestic third parties. We believe that this policy is economically efficient, given the significant quantities of pulplog available from third parties and our
	increasing proportion of sawlogs yielded from our plantations. We believe that




	 




	19







	Table of Contents




	the aggregate of our existing plantations, land currently held by us that we intend to afforest and the third-party purchases we make in the ordinary course
	of our business will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated future demand for sawlogs and pulplogs.





	Chile





	In May 2004, our forestry affiliates entered into an agreement with affiliates of Empresas CMPC S.A., or CMPC, to exchange forestry land held by the CMPC
	affiliates for land held by our forestry affiliates and made a cash payment to the CMPC affiliates. Pursuant to the agreement, our forestry affiliates acquired approximately 26,000 hectares of forestry land from the CMPC affiliates and transferred
	approximately 9,000 hectares of forestry land.




	In December 2004, we acquired from Terranova S.A. 21,800 hectares of forestry land located
	in the Seventh Region of Chile. Approximately 12,300 hectares of this land is planted with radiata pine.




	On January 6, 2005, through
	our subsidiary Forestal Valdivia S.A., we acquired 80% of Forestal Los Lagos S.A., which represented an investment of U.S.$21.4 million and included 9,234 hectares of land planted with eucalyptus in the Fourteenth Region of Chile.




	On June 30, 2006, through our subsidiaries Aserraderos Arauco S.A., Forestal Celco S.A., Bosques Arauco S.A. and Forestal Valdivia S.A., we acquired
	the forestry assets of Cementos Bío-Bío S.A. The acquisition represented an investment of approximately U.S.$133.3 million. The acquired assets consist of 21,000 hectares of pine plantations, one sawmill with an annual production
	capacity of approximately 250,000 cubic meters per year and a remanufacturing facility.




	On October 11, 2006, the Bío
	Bío Investment Fund, a Chilean fund in which a group of Chilean insurance companies and other private investors participate, acquired the assets of Forestal Bío-Bío S.A. for U.S.$346 million, which include approximately 40,000
	hectares of plantations. On that same date, Arauco entered into certain agreements with the Bío Bío Investment Fund pursuant to which Arauco became the administrator and exclusive buyer of these forestry assets. Arauco receives an
	annual fee for the administration of the forests. Araucos obligations under these agreements include the purchase of the funds forestry assets over a seven-year term beginning in 2006 and the purchase of the funds supply of timber
	during the same period. Arauco will pay a total of U.S.$461.6 million for the purchase of the funds forestry assets and timber supply over such seven-year term.




	In January 2007, the Bío Bío Investment Fund transferred all of its assets and financial debt to Forestal Río Grande S.A., its newly created subsidiary. At the same time, the Bío Bío
	Investment Fund assigned all the administration and supply agreements it had entered into with Arauco to Forestal Río Grande S.A. Arauco has determined that Forestal Río Grande S.A. is a variable interest entity of which Arauco is the
	primary beneficiary. As a result, commencing on October 11, 2006, Arauco consolidates the assets and liabilities of Forestal Río Grande S.A. The indebtedness of Forestal Río Grande S.A. is neither secured by Arauco nor is Arauco
	liable for such indebtedness. See Note 1(c) to our audited consolidated financial statements.




	In January 2007, through its subsidiary
	Bosques Arauco S.A., Arauco acquired 5,105 hectares of radiata pine plantation (excluding land) from Forestal Anchile Ltda. This acquisition represented an investment of approximately U.S.$43.6 million.






	In July 2008, through its subsidiary Forestal Valdivia S.A., Arauco acquired U.S.$14 million worth of plantations from Lafarge Chile S.A.

	Argentina





	In October 2005, through our Argentine subsidiary Industrias Forestales S.A., we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S. 100% of the stock of Ecoboard S.A.I.F. and Louis Dreyfus S.A.I.F. (subsequently renamed Ecoresine
	S.A.) in Argentina and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of Caif S.A. and LD Manufacturing S.A. (subsequently renamed Faplac S.A.) and 60% of the stock of Flooring S.A. As a result of these acquisitions, we own another
	8,000 hectares of plantations in Argentina.




	In November 2006, through its subsidiary Arauco Internacional S.A., Arauco acquired La
	Señora del Milagro S.R.L. (susquently renamed Forestal Nuestra Señora del Carmen S.A.), an Argentine forestry company, which owns approximately 4,000 hectares of land in Argentina, for U.S. $5.4 million.




	In September 2007, Faplac S.A acquired 40% of the stock of Flooring S.A., from Fantoni SpA for U.S.$1.5 million.




	In March 2008, Ecoboard SAIF, Ecoresine S.A. and CAIF S.A. merged with Industrias Forestales S.A.




	In March 2008, Faplac S.A. acquired 20% of the stock of Savitar S.A. and El Oasis S.A., for U.S.$2.2 million, both Argentine forestry companies and
	owners of about 10,000 hectares of land.




	In December 2008, Alto Paraná S.A. acquired 99.99% of the stock of the Brazilian company
	Lucchese Empreendimentos e Participacoes Ltda. and capitalized up to U.S.$29 million, with the intention of acquiring plantations in Brazil.





	Brazil





	In March 2005, through our Brazilian subsidiary Arauco do Brasil Ltda., we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S. 100%
	of the stock of LD Forest Products S.A. in Brazil and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of Placas do Paraná S.A. and 50% of the stock of Dynea Brasil S.A. As a result of these acquisitions, we acquired 25,800
	hectares of plantations in Brazil.




	In August 2006, through our subsidiary Arauco Forest Brasil S.A., we acquired from the Marchiori Group
	certain forestry land in Brazil. This investment of U.S.$39.6 million includes 14,715 hectares of land and plantations, mostly consisting of elliotti pine.




	On September 27, 2007 Arauco entered into an agreement for the joint ownership of land in Brazil with Stora Enso Oyj, a Finnish-Swedish multinational corporation. Pursuant to the agreement, Arauco acquired 80% of
	the shares in Stora Enso Arapoti Empreendimentos Agrícolas S.A., now Arauco Florestal Arapoti S.A., which owns 50,000 hectares of land, including 25,000 hectares of pine and 5,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantations; 20% of the shares in Stora
	Enso Arapoti Indústria de Papel S.A., which owns a paper mill with an annual production capacity of 205,000 tons of light weight coated paper; and 100% of the shares of Stora Enso Arapoti Serraria Ltda., which owns a sawmill with an annual
	production capacity of 150,000 cubic meters per year. This alliance required an investment of U.S.$208.4 million, which was financed with Araucos resources and commercial bank loans.





	Uruguay





	On May 17, 2009, our
	subsidiary Arauco International S.A. and a subsidiary of Stora Enso Oyj agreed in a joint venture partnership to acquire the Uruguayan subsidiaries of the Spanish Grupo Empresarial ENCE S.A. The companies to be acquired are Eufores S.A., Celulosa y
	Energía Punta Pereira S.A. and Zona Franca Punta Pereira S.A. The main assets of these subsidiaries include (i) 130,000 hectares of land located in the central and western zones of Uruguay (which include 73,000 hectares of plantation
	forests and 13,000 hectares under covenants with third party owners, of which 7,000 hectares are planted) and (ii) industrial sites in Punta Pereira and MBopicuá, a river barge terminal, a woodchip mill and a forestry nursery. This
	joint acquisition represents a purchase of $343 milion by Arauco and Stora Enso, where each party will equally invest $171.5 million. We expect to consummate this acquisition during the second half of 2009.

	Forest Management






	For our pine plantations, our forestry management activities seek to increase sawlogs through advanced genetic techniques, planting and site preparation procedures, thinning and pruning. Managed forests can produce
	trees of larger diameter and, if pruned, a higher proportion of clear wood, which generally commands a higher price than knotted wood. Although some land is not suitable for the production of pruned logs, at December 31, 2008, over 37.6% of our
	pine forests in Chile were designed for clear wood production.




	For our eucalyptus plantations, our forestry management activities seek to
	increase the amount of fiber production per hectare through advanced genetic techniques and planting and site preparation procedures. Eucalyptus is more expensive to plant than pine; however, after planting, eucalyptus requires minimal forest
	management, yields more fiber per hectare and has a shorter growth cycle and greater wood density than pine, resulting in a greater amount of pulp production per hectare.




	As of December 31, 2008, we had eight nurseries in Chile, Argentina and Brazil, in which we grow seedlings using seeds and using cuttings from genetically selected trees. To achieve higher quality trees and an
	increased growth rate, we apply strict selection criteria to the trees from which seedlings are produced. We then plant the seedlings manually. Depending upon the species of tree to be planted and the nutrient and physical characteristics of the
	soil, we may also undertake a certain amount of ground preparation before planting.




	Our other principal forest activities are thinning,
	pruning and harvesting.




	Thinning, or culling inferior trees from the plantation, occurs in the following two stages:



	 





	 




	




	 






	Thinning to waste

	. Some thinned trees are chipped and used in pulp production. Thinning to waste occurs after four to six years and results in an average
	reduction of the number of trees per hectare from 1,250 to approximately 700.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Commercial thinning

	. Thinned trees are used in pulp production or, depending on the quality of the particular land, as sawlogs. Commercial thinning occurs at
	10 to 12 years and results in an average reduction of the number of trees per hectare from 700 to approximately 450.







	This high level of
	thinning is economical for the following reasons:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the cost of planting is relatively low,






	 





	 




	




	 





	the higher number of young trees provide each other with natural protection from the elements, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the high degree of selection that thinning makes possible leaves only the highest quality trees to be harvested.







	Pruning involves removing branches, the source of knots, which are the main defect in sawn timber. Pruning results in a high-quality clearwood sawlog of
	5.3 meters from each tree, and is conducted three times:



	 





	 




	




	 





	at the time of the first thinning,






	 





	 




	




	 





	two years later, when trees are six to eight years old, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	one year later, when trees are seven to nine years old.







	Our eucalyptus plantations are neither thinned nor pruned.




	Harvesting timber involves felling trees, removing branches from the
	logs, cutting the logs into appropriate sections and loading the logs onto trucks for transport to sawmills, panel mills, pulp mills or ports for direct export. We use the lower section of the radiata pine, comprising the first seven to 12 meters,
	in sawmills and plywood mills




	 




	22







	Table of Contents




	or it is exported as sawlogs. We use the mid-section of the radiata pine, comprising, on average, the next eight to 13 meters, in either sawmills or pulp
	mills, depending on the diameter and quality of the pine. We use the top section of the tree for pulp and MDF production.




	We monitor
	product demand and our current inventory levels, and we match harvests from sections of our plantations that will provide the optimal yield given our product requirements. This process involves the use of sophisticated operations research models and
	close communication between our different operating areas to ensure that the correct amounts of timber of the required characteristics are supplied. We replant as soon as practicable after harvesting, with an average period between harvesting and
	replanting of one year.




	The following table illustrates, on a hectare basis, the extent of our thinning, pruning and harvesting activities
	during the periods indicated.

	We manage our forest activities, but we hire independent contractors to perform the bulk of our
	operations, including planting, maintenance, thinning, pruning, harvesting, transportation and access road construction. As of December 31, 2008, we had arrangements with more than 403 independent contractors that employed over 13,437 workers.
	Many of these contractors have long-standing relationships with us, but we award many contracts based on competitive bids. We believe that our arrangements with independent contractors provide greater flexibility and efficiency than performing these
	activities directly.




	Since areas of farmland and native forests geographically separate our forest holdings, our plantations are naturally
	protected against the spread of certain diseases. In addition, our subsidiary Bioforest has developed techniques to protect our forests from pests and diseases. The most prevalent pest is the European pine shoot moth, which may damage the tips of
	the radiata pine, resulting in deformations to the tree. We control this moth with biological methods. Specifically, we introduced the Orgilus Obscurator, a parasitic wasp that attacks only the European pine shoot moth. Other methods we use to
	control pests include the mechanical removal of affected tips and the use of low toxicity chemical products. Other potential diseases and pests include a fungus called Dothistroma, a fungus that reduces a trees growth rate, and the Sirex
	insect, which attacks decaying trees and results in a thinned forest.




	We operate an extensive fire control organization that interacts
	with the fire control organizations of other forestry companies to ensure that any fire damage to our forests is minimal. The operation primarily consists of a system of spotter towers, manned 24 hours a day during the summer months, from which
	spotters report the direction of any fire observed to a central command post, where the fires exact location is determined and an appropriate ground and/or aerial response is formulated. Over the last five years, this system has limited fire
	damage to our forests to an average of 0.27% of the plantations per year.






	Forest Production






	We harvested 16.5 million cubic meters of logs during the year ended December 31, 2008, consisting of 9.5 million cubic meters of sawlogs,
	5.5 million cubic meters of radiata pine pulplogs and 1.5 million cubic meters of eucalyptus pulplogs and other logs. We did not export any pulplogs during 2008 because substantially all of the pulplogs from our forests were used in our
	pulp mills. During 2008, our sawmills and panel mills used 8.9 million cubic meters of sawlogs, and no sawlogs were exported. We also sold 1.7 million cubic meters of sawlogs to unaffiliated domestic sawmills during 2008.




	A log merchandising facility located at the same site as our Horcones I and Horcones II Sawmills optimizes, cuts and classifies wood destined for our
	plywood facility, sawmills or pulp mills with an annual processing capacity of 1.7 million cubic meters of logs per year. The Nueva Aldea Complex also includes a log merchandising facility, with an annual processing capacity of 2.6 million
	cubic meters of logs per year.

	Pulp





	We believe that we were Chiles largest producer of bleached and unbleached softwood market pulp in terms of production in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, pulp sales were U.S.$1,792.8 million, representing 48.5% of our
	total sales revenue for the period.




	Pulp obtained from wood fibers is used in the manufacture of printing and writing paper, hygienic and
	sanitary paper, board and packaging. Whether a specific kind of pulp is suitable for a particular end use depends not only on the type of wood but also on the process used to transform the wood into pulp. Pulp made from softwoods, such as radiata
	pine, has long fibers and is used to provide durability and strength to paper products. Bleached pulp is used primarily for printing and writing papers and for tissue. Unbleached pulp is used primarily for linerboard (a packaging material). Pulp
	made from hardwoods, such as eucalyptus, has short fibers and is used in combination with long fiber in manufacturing paper products.




	We
	use a chemical process, known as the kraft process, in our pulp mills in Chile and Argentina. The raw wood is in the form of pulplogs and chips, which are combined in the production process to produce pulp. The pulplogs are first debarked and
	chipped. The chips are then screened, mixed and cooked with chemicals to separate the bulk of the lignin from the wood fibers. After the material is screened and washed, it is then passed to high-density tanks. For bleached pulp, the next step is a
	five-stage bleaching process using chemicals, primarily chlorine dioxide. At all of our pulp mills, the bleaching process is preceded by an oxygen delignification stage. Then, the fibers are subjected to a final stage where the sheets are formed and
	subsequently dried and baled for transport to customers. The lignin and bark produced during this process is used to fuel the boilers that produce steam, providing heat and generating electricity for the mill. Our bleached pulp is bleached to a 90+
	brightness level, as measured by the ISO test procedure, which is one of the industrys measurement methods.





	Pulp Mills





	At December 31, 2008, we owned and operated five pulp mills in Chile and one in Argentina, with an aggregate installed annual production capacity of
	approximately 3,041,000 metric tons. Our six pulp mills produced 2,578,238 metric tons of bleached pulp and 320,021 metric tons of unbleached pulp in 2008

	.





	All of our pulp mills in Chile except for the Nueva Aldea Mill and the Licancel Mill are ISO 9001:2000 and ISO14001:2004 certified. We expect that the Nueva Aldea Mill and the Licancel Mill will be certified ISO
	9001:2000 and ISO 14001:2004 by the end of 2009. The Alto Paraná Mill in Argentina is certified under ISO 9001:2000 and ISO14001:2004. No seasonal factors affect plant utilization, and the pulp mills generally run at full capacity throughout
	the year, with eight to ten days of maintenance scheduled every 12 months.

	Operations at the Licancel Mill were temporarily suspended for approximately six months from June 2007 until January 2008. During 2009, we expect that the Licancel Mill will produce
	unbleached pulp for a three-month period.







	Chile






	Arauco I.

	Arauco I, which was completed in 1972, is located at the Arauco Mill in the heart of a group of our radiata pine plantations in the
	Eighth Region of Chile. Arauco I produces elementary chlorine-free pulp, which does not use chlorine gas. Elementary chlorine-free pulp is also produced by a significant portion of our competitors in each of the worlds major pulp producing
	regions. The installed annual production capacity of Arauco I is approximately 290,000 metric tons of eucalyptus and pine bleached kraft pulp.





	Arauco II.

	Also located at the Arauco Mill, Arauco II was completed in 1991. Arauco IIs pulping process is fundamentally the same as that of Arauco I, but it includes technological improvements in its production process and
	environmental design. Arauco II is also equipped to produce elementary chlorine-free pulp. The installed annual production capacity of Arauco II is approximately 500,000 metric tons of pine bleached kraft pulp.







	Constitución Mill.

	The Constitución Mill is located in the heart of a group of our radiata pine forests in the Seventh Region of
	Chile. As of December 31, 2008, the Constitución Mill was the largest unbleached softwood market pulp mill in the world, with an installed annual production capacity of approximately 355,000 metric tons. In February 2006, the COREMA of
	the Seventh Region of Chile approved an environmental impact study for the construction of a new pipeline for the Constitución Mill, which commenced operations in February 2007. The Constitución Mill is equipped to produce elementary
	chlorine-free pulp.







	Licancel Mill.

	We acquired the Licancel Mill in September 1999. It is located in Licantén, which
	is 250 kilometers south of Santiago. The mill has an installed annual production capacity of approximately 140,000 metric tons of eucalyptus kraft pulp and pine bleached kraft pulp. The Licancel Mill is equipped to produce elementary chlorine-free
	pulp.




	Since June 2007, our operations at the Licancel Mill have been subject to environmental scrutiny by Chilean environmental regulators
	and the public. In June 2007, in connection with the death of fish in the Mataquito River, approximately 15 kilometers downstream of the mill, we decided to voluntarily suspend our operations in the Licancel Mill as a preventive measure. In
	addition, Chilean authorities, including the health authorities and the

	Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios

	(Sanitary Services Superintendency), required that we suspend activities at the Licancel Mill and that we suspend any further
	discharges into the river. We also commenced independent investigations relating to the cause of the death of the fish. On June 18, 2007, as a result of a pipe leakage in the




	 




	25







	Table of Contents




	water treatment system currently in place at the Licancel Mill, an estimated 50 cubic meters of effluents reached the Mataquito River. On that same date, we
	decided to close the mill indefinitely and informed the Sanitary Services Superintendency of the incident. On October 3, 2007, we requested to the health authority (

	Autoridad Sanitaria

	) of the Seventh Region of Chile that it remove the
	suspension of activities at the Licancel Mill. On October 22, 2007, the health authority of the Seventh Region of Chile removed the suspension and imposed certain conditions relating to our activities in the mill consisting primarily of the
	implementation of certain emergency detection and control programs and systems, with which we have complied. Furthermore, on November 12, 2007 the Sanitary Services Superintendency removed the suspension regarding the release of discharges by
	the Licancel Mill. The mill resumed operations during January 2008.




	We estimate that the suspension of operations at the Licancel Mill
	resulted in a loss of profits of approximately U.S.$4 million per month. The proceedings and the related sanctions are included in detail in Note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements. Several administrative and judicial proceedings
	have been commenced regarding the events at the Licancel Mill and the death of fish at the Mataquito River, including a civil lawsuit instituted by the National Defense Council seeking reparations, damages and indemnification from us for
	environmental harm allegedly caused by the Licancel Mill. In 2008, we invested U.S.$8 million in a new effluent treatment system to decrease the likelihood of future suspensions. However, we can offer no assurance that the Licancel Mill will be able
	to operate without further interruptions. Any future suspension of operations at the Licancel Mill may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Item 3. Environmental concerns led us to suspend our
	operations at the Licancel Mill, which adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations and Item 8. Financial Information- Legal Proceedings.




	We expect that the Licancel Mill will produce unbleached pulp for a three-month period during 2009.





	Valdivia Mill.

	We completed construction of the Valdivia Mill during the first quarter of 2004 and commenced operations in February 2004. The
	Valdivia Mill is located in Fourteenth Region of Chile (which was previously part of the Tenth Region of Chile), an area with significant radiata pine and eucalyptus plantations. The Valdivia Mill has an installed potential annual production
	capacity of approximately 550,000 metric tons of bleached pulp, consisting of softwood pulp and eucalyptus pulp. The Valdivia Mill is equipped to produce elementary chlorine-free pulp.






	The Valdivia Mill has been subject to legal and administrative proceedings by the Chilean environmental regulators. Primarily, it has been alleged that
	the Valdivia Mills operations impacted the nearby Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary and contributed to the migration and death of black-neck swans in an area downstream from the mill on the Cruces River. In connection with an environmental
	administrative proceeding, environmental regulators required us to temporarily suspend operations at the Valdivia Mill for approximately one month in January 2005. We resumed operations at the mill on February 18, 2005. On June 8, 2005, we
	voluntarily suspended operations at the Valdivia Mill, which we estimate resulted in a loss of sales of approximately U.S.$1.0 million per day and a loss of profits of approximately U.S.$250,000 per day. Pursuant to the decision of our board of
	directors based on certain clarifications provided by the COREMA of the Tenth Region of Chile, the mill resumed operations on August 12, 2005 at a reduced annual production of 440,000 metric tons or 80% of its authorized production capacity,
	after 64 days of suspended operations. In order to achieve the full production capacity authorized by applicable permits (equal to 550,000 metric tons of wood pulp per year), the pulp mill had to comply with certain new requirements established by
	the COREMA of the Tenth Region of Chile including modifications to the effluents parameters (including, among others, aluminum, sulfate, nitrogen and chlorate). In March 2006, Knight Piesold, an independent environmental auditing firm
	appointed by the COREMA of the Tenth Region of Chile, officially determined that the Valdivia Mill had complied with the applicable requirements. On January 18, 2008, the COREMA authorized the Valdivia Mill to return to its authorized
	production capacity of 550,000 metric tons. The mill gradually increased its production over a four-month period starting in March 2008 and reached full capacity in June 2008.

	Item 3. Key InformationRisk
	FactorsRisks Relating to Arauco and the Forestry IndustryEnvironmental concerns led us to temporarily suspend our operations at the Valdivia Mill, which adversely affected, and in the future may continue to adversely affect, our
	business, financial condition and results of operations, Item 4. Information on the CompanyGovernment RegulationEnvironment and Item 8. Financial InformationLegal Proceedings.

	In connection with our decision to suspend operations at the Valdivia Mill, our President and Chief
	Executive Officer resigned from his positions. For more information about our executive officers, see Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and EmployeesDirectors and Executive Officers.




	The National Defense Council has instituted a reparation action for environmental damage seeking reparations, damages and indemnification from us for
	environmental harm allegedly caused by the Valdivia Mill. In addition, since the end of 2004, various criminal proceedings relating to alleged violations of several environmental laws have been instituted in Chile in which some of our mills may be
	involved.

	See

	Item 3. Key InformationRisk FactorsRisks Relating to Arauco and the Forestry IndustryWe are subject to legal proceedings related to our mills, which could adversely affect our business, financial
	condition and results of operations.




	In 2005, the COREMA instructed us to present by March 31, 2006, an environmental impact
	study for the construction of a pipeline to discharge the Valdivia Mills wastewater in a body of water other than the Cruces River or the Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary or their sources. The COREMA also instructed us to construct and put
	into operation the pipeline no later than 15 months from the date COREMA approves the environmental impact study in final form. COREMA initially extended the deadline for the presentation of this environmental impact study to April 2007 and, prior
	to the expiration of the April 2007 deadline, extended it again to March 31, 2009. On February 19, 2009, we submitted to the COREMA of the Fourteenth Region of Chile an environmental impact study for the construction of a pipeline to
	discharge the Valdivia Mills wastewater in the Pacific Ocean near Punta Maiquillahue, that is, in a body of water other than the Cruces River, the Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary or their sources.




	Additionally, in April 2007, when the COREMA approved the March 31, 2009 deadline, it also required us to present an additional environmental impact
	study for the implementation of substantial technological improvements on the quality of the effluents generated by the Valdivia Mill. We submitted this study on June 13, 2007. On June 30, 2008, the COREMA approved that environmental
	impact study. However, the approval was subject to certain conditions that, in the opinion of Arauco, affected the feasibility of the project. For such reason, Arauco filed an appeal (

	recurso de reclamación

	) before the Directive
	Council (

	Consejo Directivo

	) of the CONAMA challenging the conditions. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been notified of the resolution of that appeal.




	The COREMA of the Tenth Region of Chile appointed a Canadian consulting company, Ecometrix, to analyze and prepare a report on different feasible
	alternatives for discharge of the Valdivia Mill effluents. In August 2008, the consulting firm identified certain locations as suitable alternatives for discharging the effluents, one of which is the alternative we proposed in our environmental
	impact study.




	Approvals by the COREMA of our environmental impact studies regarding the pipeline and the improvement of the quality of the
	effluents, and the construction and operation of the pipeline, are each subject to many environmental, regulatory, engineering and political uncertainties. As a result, we cannot provide any assurances that the projects will ever be approved or
	completed. If either our environmental study about the pipeline is rejected, or the installation of the pipeline is delayed for reasons attributable to us, we may face sanctions that include warnings, fines or the revocation of the Valdivia
	Mills environmental permit of operation. Alternatively, if any rejection or delays are attributable to reasons beyond our control, we believe that COREMA should extend the applicable deadlines. However, we cannot provide assurances that any
	deadline extensions would be granted, even if we comply with all the requirements that may be set forth by COREMA.




	As a result, we offer
	no assurance that the Valdivia Mill will be able to operate without further interruption. Any future suspension of operations at the Valdivia Mill or at any other of our significant operating plants would likely have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and results of operations.




	As part of the environmental resolution that modified the Valdivia Mill
	environmental permit, the COREMA of the Tenth Region of Chile asked the National Forestry Corporation, or CONAF, to elaborate an Integral Environmental Management Plan for the wetland, which was completed in 2006. The plan concluded that there was a
	need to develop a Conceptual Ecosystem Model for the wetland. CONAF selected the Science Faculty of the University of Chile to conduct this study.

	The study indicated in its second progress report that the disappearance of the luchecillo, a
	water weed that was an important food source of black-necked swans, was likely related to natural causes. Specifically, the study proposed that the disappearance of the luchecillo was caused by the convergence of three factors in May
	2004: (i) low levels of precipitation, (ii) low levels of water flow in the rivers and the wetland and (iii) three instances in which temperatures reached zero degrees Celsius or lower. According to the study, the simultaneous
	occurrence of these factors was likely responsible for the disappearance of the luchecillo which, in turn, lead to the death and migration of the swans. This second progress report was followed by a final report issued by the Science
	Faculty of the University of Chile, which was not approved by CONAF.




	On June 16, 2009, we submitted to the COREMA a request to
	increase our production by 20% in the Valdivia Mill. If the request is approved, the Valdivia Mill would increase its production from 550,000 metric tons per year to 660,000 metric tons per year, fully complying with current environmental
	regulations. The increase would be achieved through the optimization of our current production process, and does not require investments in additional equipment.





	Nueva Aldea Mill.

	During 2004, we commenced construction of the second phase of the Nueva Aldea Project, which includes the development of a new pulp mill with authorized annual production capacity of 856,000
	tons of bleached pulp, consisting of softwood pulp and eucalyptus pulp. In August 2006, we commenced the start-up process of the Nueva Aldea Pulp Mill, and production reached designed capacity in May 2007. The second phase of the Nueva Aldea Project
	was subject to significant environmental challenges, and construction of the pulp mill was temporarily suspended between January 12 and March 10, 2005.



	See



	Item 4. Information on the CompanyGovernment
	RegulationEnvironment and Item 8. Financial InformationLegal Proceedings. The Nueva Aldea Mill is equipped to produce elementary chlorine-free pulp.






	On February 20, 2006, the COREMA of the Eighth Region of Chile approved the environmental impact study for the construction and operation of the
	Nueva Aldea Mill Pipeline, which will permit the mill to discharge certain liquid effluents into the ocean. We anticipate the Nueva Aldea Mill Pipeline will commence operations in the third quarter of 2009, subject to the satisfaction of certain
	technical conditions.




	On February 9, 2009, COREMA approved our request to increase the Nueva Aldea Mills production to 20%
	above the authorized level. In this case COREMA resolved that it was not necessary to present an environmental impact study in connection with the requested increase. Our total annual authorized production capacity is now 1,030,000 metric tons.





	Argentina






	Alto
	Paraná Mill.

	Alto Paranás softwood pulp mill is located in the Province of Misiones, a region whose soil and climate are favorable for the rapid growth of pine trees. The Alto Paraná Mill is the only bleached softwood
	kraft market pulp facility in Argentina. The mill has an installed annual production capacity of approximately 350,000 tons of pulp, of which approximately 67% is bleached softwood pulp, currently representing almost all of the total bleached
	softwood pulp production capacity in Argentina, and approximately 33% is fluff pulp.








	Production Costs






	Based on information published by Resource Information Systems, Inc., our cash costs for softwood pulp production are significantly lower than the average
	costs of market pulp producers in Canada, the United States and Scandinavia, particularly with respect to timber and labor costs. While our modern facilities result in depreciation exceeding some of such Northern Hemisphere producers, our costs are
	still significantly lower than the average costs of our Northern Hemisphere competitors, on a total delivered cost basis. The following table compares our costs for the production of bleached softwood kraft market pulp to the average costs of market
	pulp producers in selected regions in the Northern Hemisphere for the year ended December 31, 2008.

	Sales






	The world market for bleached kraft market pulp during the year ended December 31, 2008 was approximately 50.2 million
	metric tons. Based on information published by Resource Information Systems, Inc., we believe that our production represented 5.18% of this market in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we sold approximately 93.4% of our bleached
	pulp abroad, principally to customers in Asia and Western Europe. Since the domestic market in Chile is dominated by a single integrated pulp and paper manufacturer, the Chilean market for bleached market pulp is relatively small.




	Integrated manufacturers dominate the world production of unbleached softwood pulp, which leaves non-integrated companies that sell market pulp, like us,
	with only a small percentage of total production. Market pulp is pulp sold to manufacturers of paper products, as opposed to pulp produced by an integrated paper producer for use in its paper production facilities. With a total world
	production of unbleached softwood kraft pulp of 54.0 million metric tons for 2008, according to Resource Information Systems, Inc., our Constitución Mill was the worlds largest single producer of unbleached softwood market pulp,
	with 15.6% of the total market in 2008. During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 97.9% of our total unbleached market pulp sales consisted of export sales. While for the last five years Asia has been our principal export market
	for unbleached market pulp, we continually seek niche markets for our products in Western Europe and the United States. Historically, our sales in the Chilean market have been less than 5% of our total unbleached pulp sales revenue.




	The following table sets forth, by region, the sales volumes of bleached and unbleached pulp for the years indicated.

	While there are many grades and varieties, pulp is a commodity that is marketed primarily on the
	basis of price and service. In marketing our pulp, we seek to establish long-term relationships with non-integrated end users of pulp by providing a competitively priced, high-quality, consistent product and excellent service. The consistency of our
	pulp derives from our high-quality mills and our use of a single species of tree, in contrast to pulp producers in some of the worlds major softwood pulp producing regions that mix different species, depending on availability and seasonality.
	Our bleached pulp is marketed under the brand names Arauco and Alto Paraná, and our unbleached pulp is marketed under the brand name Celco.




	Prices for bleached softwood kraft market pulp produced from radiata pine generally fluctuate depending on prevailing world prices, which historically
	have been cyclical. The fluctuations generally depend on worldwide demand, world production capacity, business strategies adopted by major forestry, pulp and paper producers and the availability of substitutes.

	See

	Item 5. Operating and
	Financial Review and ProspectsManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of OperationsOverview and Prices.

	In accordance with customary pulp market practice, we do not have long-term sales contracts with
	our customers; rather we maintain long-standing relationships with our customers with whom we periodically reach agreements on specific volumes and prices. We have a diversified customer base located throughout the world and totaling, as of
	December 31, 2008, more than 290 clients. As of December 31, 2008, we employed more than 12 sales agents to represent us in more than 40 countries. We manage this worldwide sales network from our headquarters in Chile.

	Plywood and Fiberboard Panels





	Our panel products consist of plywood and fiber panels. At December 31, 2008, we owned two plywood mills, one HB mill and one MDF mill in Chile, one MDF mill and one PBO mill in Argentina, and one MDF mill and
	one PBO mill in Brazil. For the year ended December 31, 2008, sales of panels were U.S.$932.4 million, representing 25.2% of our total sales revenues.

	The total annual production capacity of these eight mills is approximately 2,555,000 cubic meters
	of plywood and fiberboard panels, placing us among the principal wood panel companies in Latin America. The total installed annual production capacity of our two plywood mills is approximately 805,000 cubic meters of plywood. During 2008, they
	produced an aggregate of 666,656 cubic meters of plywood. Our HB mill has installed annual production capacity of approximately 60,000 cubic meters per year, and produced 59,825 cubic meters of panels in 2008. Our MDF mills have an installed annual
	production capacity of approximately 1,130,000 cubic meters, and in 2008 they produced an aggregate of 1,118,211 cubic meters of panels. Our PBO mills in Brazil and Argentina (acquired in March 2005 and October 2005, respectively) have an installed
	annual production capacity of approximately 560,000 cubic meters, and produced an aggregate of 516,343 cubic meters of panels in 2008.




	On
	March 9, 2005, we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S. 100% of the stock of LD Forest Products S.A. in Brazil and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of Placas do Paraná S.A. and 50% of the stock of Dynea Brasil
	S.A. We paid an aggregate purchase price for these acquisitions of approximately U.S.$168.0 million. With these acquisitions, we acquired an MDF mill with installed annual production capacity of approximately 250,000 cubic meters, a particleboard
	mill with installed annual production capacity of approximately 320,000 cubic meters, an impregnated paper mill and a formaldehyde and resin plant.




	On October 31, 2005, we acquired from Louis Dreyfus S.A.S. 100% of the stock of Ecoboard S.A.I.F. and Louis Dreyfus S.A.I.F. in Argentina and, indirectly as a result of that purchase, 100% of the stock of CAIF S.A. and LD Manufacturing
	S.A. and 60% of the stock of Flooring S.A. As a result of these acquisitions, we own a particleboard mill with installed annual production capacity of approximately 260,000 cubic meters, a chemical plant that produces resins used for the production
	of wood panels, and an MDF and particleboard-based wood floor mill with installed annual production capacity of approximately two million square meters. We paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately U.S.$55.0 million for this acquisition.




	Exports, which include sales to countries other than Chile, Argentina and Brazil, accounted for 54.2% of our total sales revenues of
	plywood and fiberboard panels for the year ended December 31, 2008. We sell plywood and fiberboard panels primarily to customers in North America, Europe, Brazil, Chile and Argentina.





	Wood Products





	Our wood products consist of sawn
	timber (green, kiln-dried lumber and flitches) and remanufactured wood products. For the year ended December 31, 2008, revenue from sales of wood products was U.S.$709.3 million, representing 19.2% of our total sales revenues for the period.

	As of December 31, 2008, we had 11 sawmills in operation, nine in Chile and two in Argentina, with
	aggregate installed annual processing capacity of approximately 5.18 million cubic meters of sawlogs and an aggregate installed annual production capacity of approximately 2.98 million cubic meters of lumber. Contractors that are not
	related to us or to each other operate our nine sawmills in Chile. We operate our sawmills in coordination with our forestry and sales operations, since our sawn timber is generally produced in accordance with customer specifications. All of our
	sawmills are located near our pine plantations.




	As of December 31, 2008, we also own six remanufacturing facilities, five in Chile
	and one in Argentina, that reprocess sawn timber into remanufactured wood products, such as moldings, jams and pre-cut pieces that end users require for doors, furniture and door and window frames. These facilities produced 332,000 cubic meters of
	remanufactured wood products in 2008. During 2008, the decrease in demand of sawn timber products due primarily to the credit crisis and the continued downturn in the real estate market in the United States resulted in our decision to close the
	following facilities (indicating the date of closure and the annual lumber production capacity of each facility):



	 





	 




	




	 





	the Arapoti sawmill (closed on March 31, 2008 with an annual production capacity of 250,000 cubic meters),






	 





	 




	




	 





	the Lomas Coloradas sawmill (closed on August 9, 2008 with an annual production capacity of 250,000 cubic meters),






	 





	 




	




	 





	the Coronel sawmill (closed on November 17, 2008 with an annual production capacity of 150,000 cubic meters), and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the Coelemu sawmill (closed on December 30, 2008 with an annual production capacity of 80,000 cubic meters).







	Aserraderos Arauco S.A. was established in 1993 to centralize management and control production in our sawmill and remanufacturing operations. Our
	sawmills and remanufacturing facilities in Chile are currently operated by independent contractors that are paid sawing service fees calculated on a fixed and variable basis depending on productivity, with price renegotiations in the event of
	material changes in costs or productivity. Each of our 13 independent contractors operates exclusively for us and only with respect to one sawmill or remanufacturing facility. We believe that our arrangements with independent contractors provide us
	with greater flexibility and efficiency than performing such activities on our own. We operate our sawmills and remanufacturing facilities in Argentina.




	The following is a brief description of our sawmills and remanufacturing facilities and their production capacity, as of December 31, 2008.

	This sawmill, previously known as the Misiones Sawmill, was completed in 2000. It has installed annual production capacity of approximately 320,000 cubic meters of lumber. It is also equipped
	with drying kilns with installed annual production capacity of approximately 320,000 cubic meters and a remanufacturing facility with installed annual production capacity of approximately 65,000 cubic meters of remanufactured wood products.





	Brazil






	Arapoti
	Sawmill.

	We acquired this sawmill as part of the agreement with Stora Enso on September 27, 2007. This sawmill has an installed annual capacity of production of approximately 250,000 cubic meters of lumber. It was closed on March 31,
	2008 due to the appreciation of the Brazilian r



	eal



	against the U.S. dollar and the housing market crisis in the United States, which has negatively affected the wood division. We do not have plans to reopen the Arapoti sawmill
	during 2009.







	Forestry Products





	Our forestry products are sawlogs, pulplogs, posts and chips. As a result of our forest management policies and the increasing maturity of our plantations, our plantations are yielding increasing volumes of forestry products, particularly
	clear wood. As the volume of clear wood has grown, we have broadened our range of forestry products. For the year ended December 31, 2008, sales of forestry products were U.S.$106.9 million, representing 2.9% of our sales revenues for such
	year.




	The following table sets forth, by category, forestry product sales to unaffiliated third parties for each of the years indicated.

	Sustainable Development







	As part of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in June 2007, we registered three electricity co-generation power plants as projects of the Clean Development Mechanism within the Kyoto Protocol. The
	three power plants, located in Trupán, Nueva Aldea (first phase) and Nueva Aldea (second phase), generate electricity through forestry biomass, which is a renewable resource, and replace fossil fuel energy from the electricity grid. In
	connection with the Clean Development Mechanism, in June 2007, we sold 482,129 Certified Emission Reductions (CERs or carbon credits). The CERs were sold to Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), a Japanese company. With this issuance, we
	became the first Chilean forestry company to issue CERs through the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. In October 2008, we sold 255,592 tons of CERs resulting from our use of forest biomass to fuel electric energy cogeneration units
	at our Nueva Aldea and Trupan facilities.






	In May 2008, we approved the construction of a new biomass cogeneration plant with a
	capacity of 25 Megawatts per year and a power boiler with a capacity of 210 tons per hour of steam in the Horcones complex. We anticipate the plant and boiler will commence operations in the second half of 2009. This operation will represent an




	 




	34







	Table of Contents




	investment of approximately U.S.$70 million. We expect that this operation will generate a surplus of energy of 24 Megawatts per year to be contributed to
	the Chilean Central Interconnected System, which distributes electrical power throughout the Central and Southern Regions of Chile. We also expect to apply for the registration of the operation as a project of the Clean Development Mechanism under
	the Kyoto Protocol.




	In January 2009, we announced plans to complete a Carbon Footprint Assessment (CFA) in furtherance of the following
	three principal objectives: to determine the amount of carbon dioxide stored in our wood products, to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions resulting from our plantation business and to establish company-wide annual greenhouse gas emissions
	standards. We expect to have the results of the assessment by June 2009.





	Competition





	We experience substantial worldwide competition in each of our geographical markets and in each of our product lines. Several of our competitors are
	larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have.





	Pulp





	We face competition in our pulp sales from one other major Chilean producer, CMPC Celulosa S.A., and from pulp producers in other regions, particularly
	Canada, the United States, New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries for soft wood bleached market pulp, Brazil and Indonesia for hardwood bleached market pulp and South Africa, Portugal and Russia for unbleached market pulp.





	Plywood and fiberboard panels





	Araucos principal competitors in the plywood markets are located in the United States, Finland and Russia. In some regions, Arauco also competes with hardwood plywood produced in China, Africa and other regions of the world.




	Araucos main competitors in the fiberboard (MDF) market are Masisa, a panel producer in Latin America, and other large producers of
	South America, New Zealand, Australia and North America. In our exports to Asia and Middle East, Arauco also competes with producers in Malaysia, Korea and China.





	Wood and forestry products





	Araucos main competitors in the forestry and wood products markets
	are the major European, North American, New Zealand and Chilean forestry companies. Arauco believes that its operating efficiencies, its competitive logistics costs, its ability to produce multiple specifications per its customers request, its
	presence in over forty countries and the versatility of radiate and taeda pine allows it to compete effectively in the world market for forestry and wood products.





	Transportation, Storage and Distribution





	To remain competitive with pulp suppliers elsewhere in the world, we ship our
	products to various distribution centers around the world from which final delivery to the customer is made. Historically, we and other Chilean forestry products producers have coordinated our transportation requirements to achieve larger lots to
	fill specially designed forestry products ships and thus obtain competitive freight rates.




	The following are the principal Chilean ports
	that we use:



	 





	 




	




	 






	Coronel.

	A private port located between Concepción and the Arauco Mill, which we constructed as a member of a consortium with five other companies and
	in which we have an equity interest of 50.0%. We shipped approximately 21.59% of our aggregate export volume through this port in 2008;






	 





	 




	




	 






	Lirquén.

	A private port in Concepción in which we have an equity interest of 20.1% and through which we shipped approximately 34.38% of our
	aggregate export volume during 2008; and







	 




	35







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 






	San Vicente and Talcahuano.

	State-owned ports near the city of Concepción through which we shipped approximately 43.99% of our aggregate export volume
	during 2008.







	The ports we use in Chile are approximately 55 kilometers from the Arauco Mill, 330 kilometers from the
	Constitución Mill, 370 kilometers from the Licancel Mill, 100 kilometers from the Nueva Aldea Mill, and 410 kilometers from the Valdivia Mill. We do not own pulp storage warehouses in any of these ports.




	We ship pulp to various ports in Europe, North and South America and Asia and, as is customary in the pulp industry, we store some stock in those ports.
	We use 13 foreign ports that have warehouse facilities available, and standard storage terms provide that we are entitled to a certain period of storage free of charge. We seek to ensure that it does not exceed the free storage period for each
	shipment. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 147,135 metric tons in storage in warehouses at foreign ports.




	We believe that
	our shipping costs are comparable to those of our international competitors, notwithstanding Chiles greater distance from Europe, because of the proximity of our plantations and mills to the Pacific coast and the economies of scale we achieve
	through the volume of our exports.




	In Argentina, timely and economical delivery of finished products to our customers is an important
	factor in our ability to compete effectively, and we ship most orders either by truck or railway almost immediately after they are produced.





	Description of Property





	Our principal properties consist of land and production plants and facilities, the majority of
	which are located in Chile. At December 31, 2008, we owned approximately 1,090,627 hectares of land in Chile, over 730,210 hectares of which consist of forest plantations, and 418,411 hectares of land in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, of which
	218,158 consist of forest plantations. In addition, at December 31, 2008, we owned various plants and facilities, including five pulp mills, four panel mills, nine sawmills and five remanufacturing facilities in Chile; one pulp mill, two
	sawmills, one MDF mill, one PBO mill and one remanufacturing facility in Argentina; and one MDF mill, one PBO mill and one sawmill in Brazil. In Brazil, the Arapoti sawmill was closed on March 31, 2008. In Chile, the Lomas Coloradas sawmill,
	the Coronel sawmill and the Coelemu sawmill were closed in 2008.





	Insurance





	Consistent with industry practice, we maintain fire insurance coverage for all our Chilean forest holdings and nurseries but do not insure against pests
	or disease. Depending on the age of the trees affected, our insurance covers timber loss, either at replacement cost or commercial value. In Argentina we maintain fire insurance for 15,000 hectares of timber assets located in the Campana region,
	near Buenos Aires. For the rest of our Argentine operations we do not maintain fire insurance for our timber assets because we believe that the risk of damage from fire is low because Argentina receives significant amounts of rainfall, particularly
	during the summer months. We do not carry fire insurance for our forests in Brazil because the risk of damage from fire does not justify the costs of carrying insurance.




	We also carry insurance, consistent with industry practice, covering our production plants, facilities and equipment. This insurance provides coverage, in the event of fire, explosion, machinery breakdown or natural
	disaster, for 12 months of business interruptions (18 months in the case of a boiler explosion in our pulp mills). All of our insurance policies covering our forest holdings and production plants, facilities and equipment in Chile are carried by the
	RSA group, La Chilena Consolidada (part of Zürich Financial Services Group) and La Interamericana (part of American International Group, Inc.).




	The forestry insurance is carried by the RSA and Penta Security Compañía de Seguros SA. Our insurance policies for facilities and equipment in Argentina are carried by RSA, La Meridional (part of
	American International Group, Inc.) and the Zürich Financial Services Group, and these policies cover damage resulting from fire. Our MDF and particleboard mills in Brazil are insured by Itaú XL Seguros Corporativos, and these policies
	cover fire, explosions, electrical damage, equipment damage and loss of profit.

	CAPITAL EXPENDITURES





	To utilize our increasing volume of forest production, we have added to, expanded and modernized our processing facilities. In 2008, aggregate capital expenditures were U.S.$451.9 million, consisting primarily of
	U.S.$189.0 million in acquisitions of plantations, U.S.$35.3 million in internal projects within our existing mills, U.S.$47.5 million in the construction of a new biomass cogeneration plant in the Horcones Complex, U.S.$29.5 million in the
	construction of the Nueva Aldea Pipeline and U.S.$14.3 million in the installation of a new biomass cogeneration power plant in the Viñales sawmill.




	These capital expenditures represent amounts accrued for purposes of our audited consolidated financial statements and do not necessarily represent the cash cost of capital expenditures in 2008.




	For the year ending December 31, 2009, we have planned capital expenditures of approximately U.S.$277.2 million, which principally include U.S$74.8
	million in acquisitions of plantations, U.S.$112.7 million in internal projects within our existing mills and an additional U.S.$19.5 million for the biomass cogeneration power plant in the Viñales sawmill.




	We also plan to invest U.S.$171.5 million in the joint acquisition with Stora Enso in Uruguay during the second half of 2009.





	GOVERNMENT REGULATION






	Environment





	In each country where we have operations, we are subject to numerous national and local environmental laws, regulations, decrees and municipal
	ordinances concerning, among other things, health, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, discharges into the air, soil and water and other environmental impacts. Some of these laws require us to conduct environmental impact studies
	of future projects or activities (or major modifications thereto). Under these laws, our operations may be subject to specific approvals, consents and regulatory requirements, and emissions and discharges may be required to meet specific standards
	and limitations. We have made and will continue to make substantial expenditures to comply with such environmental laws, regulations, decrees and ordinances.





	Chile





	The Chilean legislation to which we are subject includes the Chilean Environmental Law (

	Ley
	Sobre Bases Generales del Medio Ambiente

	) and related regulations. The Chilean Environmental Law created the National Environmental Commission (

	Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente

	), or CONAMA, which includes under its organization
	the various Regional Environmental Commissions (the COREMAs). CONAMA is a public agency under the supervision of the President of Chile through the Environmental Ministry (

	Ministro Presidente de la Comisión Nacional del Medio
	Ambiente

	). These commissions are responsible for, among other things, coordinating existing environmental regulations and evaluating environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact. Under the Chilean Environmental Law, we
	are required to conduct environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact of any future projects or activities (or their significant modifications) that may affect the environment. These and other regulations also establish
	procedures for private citizens to object to the plans or studies submitted by project owners.




	CONAMA, the COREMA, and other governmental
	agencies may also participate in the oversight of the implementation of projects in accordance with their environmental impact studies or declarations of environmental impact. Under the Chilean Environmental Law and other regulations, affected
	private citizens, public agencies and local authorities can sue to enforce environmental compliance. Enforcement remedies include temporary or permanent closure of facilities and fines. The application of these environmental laws and remedies may
	adversely affect the manner in which we seek to implement our business strategy and our ability to realize our strategy.




	We recently
	faced, and continue to face, certain environmental administrative proceedings in connection with certain of our pulp mills. In connection with these proceedings and based on Administrative Proceedings Law

	Table of Contents




	No. 19,880, the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile, ordered the suspension of production at the Valdivia Mill as an interim preventive measure in
	January 2005. The mill reopened in February 2005, after the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile determined that the mill could continue operations subject to a number of conditions.




	On June 6, 2005, the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile modified our permit for the Valdivia Mill by, among other requirements, reducing the
	annual production capacity of the mill to 440,000 metric tons until we complied with certain conditions, which included additional monitoring of some aspects of our emissions. In addition, the modifications set new emission limits for several
	pollutants and require us to conduct a new environmental impact study for an alternative system for the discharge of wastewater, which we were directed to submit to the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile for approval no later than March 31,
	2006. On February 1, 2006, the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile extended this deadline to March 31, 2007. We must construct and implement the alternative system, which cannot involve the discharge of effluents into the Cruces River,
	the Carlos Anwandter Sanctuary or their sources, within 15 months of approval of the environmental impact study in final form. The COREMA initially extended the deadline for the presentation of this environmental impact study to April 2007 and,
	prior to the expiration of the April 2007 deadline, extended it again to March 31, 2009. On February 19, 2009, we submitted to the COREMA of the Fourteenth Region of Chile an environmental impact study for the construction of a pipeline to
	discharge the Valdivia Mills wastewater in the Pacific Ocean near Punta Maiquillahue, that is, in a body of water other than the Cruces River, the Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary or their sources. In April 2007, when it approved the
	March 31, 2009 deadline, the COREMA required us to present an additional environmental impact study for the implementation of substantial technological improvements on the quality of the effluents generated by the Valdivia Mill. We submitted
	this environmental impact study on June 13, 2007.




	On June 30, 2008

	,

	the COREMA approved that environmental impact study.
	However, the approval was subject to certain conditions that, in the opinion of Arauco, affected the feasibility of the project. For such reason, Arauco filed an appeal (

	recurso de reclamación

	) before the Directive Council (

	Consejo
	Directivo

	) of the CONAMA challenging the conditions. As of the date of this annual report, we have not been notified of the resolution of that appeal.




	On June 8, 2005, we voluntarily suspended operations at the Valdivia Mill, which we estimate resulted in a loss of sales of approximately U.S.$1.0 million per day and a loss of profits of approximately
	U.S.$250,000 per day. Pursuant to the decision of our board of directors based on certain clarifications provided by the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile, the mill resumed operations on August 12, 2005 at a reduced annual production of
	440,000 metric tons, or 80% of its authorized production capacity, after 64 days of suspended operations. In order to achieve the full production capacity authorized by applicable permits (equal to 550,000 metric tons of wood pulp per year), the
	pulp mill had to comply with certain new requirements established by the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile, including modifications to the effluents parameters (including, among others, aluminum, sulfate, nitrogen and chlorate). In March
	2006, Knight Piesold, an independent environmental auditing firm appointed by the COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile, officially determined that the Valdivia Mill had complied with the applicable requirements. On January 18, 2008, the COREMA
	of the Fourteenth Region of Chile authorized the Valdivia Mill to return to its annual authorized production capacity of 550,000 metric tons. The mill gradually increased its production over a four-month period starting in March 2008 and reached
	full capacity in June 2008. The suspension of operations at the Valdivia Mill adversely affected our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any future suspension of operations at the Valdivia Mill or at any other of our significant
	operating plants can be expected to have similar adverse effects. We offer no assurance that the Valdivia Mill will be able to operate without further interruption.

	See

	Item 3. Key InformationRisk FactorsRisks Relating to
	Arauco and the Forestry IndustryEnvironmental concerns led us to temporarily suspend our operations at the Valdivia Mill, which adversely affected, and in the future may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and
	results of operations and Item 4. Information on the CompanyDescription of BusinessPulpPulp millsChileValdivia Mill.




	As part of the environmental resolution that modified the Valdivia Mill environmental permit, the COREMA of the Tenth Region asked CONAF to elaborate an Integral Environmental Management Plan for the wetland, which
	was completed in 2006. The plan concluded that there was a need to develop a Conceptual Ecosystem Model for the wetland. CONAF selected the Science Faculty of the University of Chile to conduct this study.

	The study indicated in its second progress report that the disappearance of the luchecillo, a
	water weed that was an important food source of the black-necked swans, was likely related to natural causes. Specifically, the study proposed that the disappearance of the luchecillo was caused by the convergence of three factors in May
	2004: (i) low levels of precipitation, (ii) low levels of water flow in the rivers and the wetland and (iii) three instances in which temperatures reached zero degrees Celsius or lower. According to the study, the simultaneous
	occurrence of these factors was likely responsible for the disappearance of the luchecillo which, in turn, lead to the death and migration of the swans. This second progress report was followed by a final report issued by the Science
	Faculty of the University of Chile, which was not approved by CONAF.




	The COREMA for the Tenth Region of Chile appointed a Canadian
	consulting company, Ecometrix, to analyze and prepare a report on different feasible alternatives for discharge of the Valdivia Mill effluents. In August 2008, the consulting firm identified certain locations as suitable alternatives for discharging
	the effluents, one of which is the alternative we proposed in our environmental impact study. Approval by the COREMA of our environmental impact study regarding a pipeline, the construction and operation of such a pipeline and also the approval of
	the environmental impact study regarding the improvement of the quality of the effluents are each subject to many environmental, regulatory, engineering and political uncertainties at this time. As a result, we cannot give you any assurance that
	such projects will ever be approved or completed. If either our environmental study about the pipeline is rejected, or the installation of the pipeline is delayed for reasons attributable to us, we may face sanctions that include warnings, fines or
	the revocation of the Valdivia Mills environmental permit of operation. Alternatively, if any rejection or delays are attributable to reasons beyond our control, we believe that COREMA should extend the applicable deadlines. However, we cannot
	provide assurances that any deadline extensions would be granted, even if we comply with all the requirements that may be set forth by COREMA. Any future suspension of operations at the Valdivia Mill or at any other of our significant operating
	plants can be expected to have similar adverse effects. We offer no assurance that the Valdivia Mill will be able to operate without further interruption.




	The National Defense Council has instituted an action seeking reparations, damages and indemnification from us for environmental harm allegedly caused by the Valdivia Mill and the Licancel Mill. In addition, since the
	end of 2004, various criminal proceedings relating to alleged violations of several environmental laws have been instituted in Chile in which some of our mills may be involved.

	See

	Item 3. Key InformationRisk FactorsRisks
	Relating to Arauco and the Forestry IndustryWe are subject to legal proceedings related to our mills, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and Item 8. Financial
	InformationLegal Proceedings.




	We also faced environmental proceedings in connection with the pulp mill at the Nueva Aldea
	Project while it was under construction. As a result, the COREMA for the Eighth Region of Chile required us to suspend construction at the Nueva Aldea Project for approximately two months in January 2005. We resumed the construction of the pulp mill
	in March 2005, after complying with the conditions set by the COREMA for the Eighth Region of Chile. On August 30, 2006, the Nueva Aldea pulp mill initiated its production, and production capacity reached designed capacity in May 2007. There
	can be no assurance that the pulp mills will continue to operate without further interruption.

	See

	Item 8. Financial InformationLegal Proceedings.




	On June 16, 2009, we submitted to the COREMA a request to increase our production by 20% in the Valdivia Mill. If the request is approved, the
	Valdivia Mill would increase its production from 550,000 metric tons per year to 660,000 metric tons per year, fully complying with current environmental regulations. The increase would be achieved through the optimization of our current production
	process, and does not require investments in additional equipment.





	Argentina





	Our operations in Argentina are subject to Argentine environmental legislation, including regulation by municipal, provincial and federal governmental
	authorities. Argentine environmental legislation includes the requirement that water used or recovered in the production process be treated and purified before being returned to the Paraná River at the proper temperature. All gaseous
	emissions must be scrubbed to ensure satisfactory levels of waste particle recovery and odor removal. Regular testing of river and air quality is used to monitor the ultimate impact of the mill on the environment.

	We believe that we are currently in material compliance with all applicable local and national
	environmental regulations governing our operations in Argentina.





	Brazil





	Our Brazilian operations are subject to environmental legislation, including municipal, regional and federal governmental laws, regulations and licensing
	requirements. Law No. 6,938 establishes strict liability for environmental damage, mechanisms for enforcement of environmental standards and licensing requirements for activities that are damaging or potentially damaging to the environment. A
	violation of environmental laws and regulations may result in

	fines,






	 





	 




	




	 





	partial or total suspension of activities,






	 





	 




	




	 





	forfeiture or restriction of tax incentives or benefits, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	forfeiture or suspension of participation in credit lines with official credit establishments.







	As a result, we may become liable for environmental damages caused by management of our materials, including damages caused during the transportation, treatment and
	disposal of our industrial waste, even where third parties manage such activities on our behalf.




	Law No. 9,605 provides that
	individuals or entities whose conduct or activities cause harm to the environment are subject to criminal and administrative sanctions and are liable for any costs to repair the damages resulting from such harm. For individuals who commit
	environmental crimes, criminal sanctions range from fines to imprisonment; for legal entities, criminal sanctions may include fines, partial or total suspension of activities, restrictions on participation in government contracts and, in cases of
	bad faith, dissolution. In addition, Law No. 9,605 also establishes that the corporate structure of a company may be disregarded if the structure impedes the recovery for harm caused to the environment. We are not aware of any successful
	assertion of claims against shareholders under this provision of Law No. 9,605.




	We believe we are currently in material compliance
	with all applicable local and national environmental regulations governing our operations in Brazil.





	Forestry Regulation






	Chile





	The management and exploitation
	of forests in Chile is regulated by the Forests Law of 1931, as amended, and Decree-Law No. 701 of 1974, as amended. The Forests Law and Decree-Law No. 701 impose a variety of restrictions on the management and exploitation of forests.
	Forestry activities, including thinning, on land that is designated as preferably suited for forests or that has natural or planted forests, are subject to management plans that require the approval of the CONAF. In addition, the Forests Law and
	Decree-Law No. 701 impose certain standards for the prevention of forest fires, as well as fines for the harvesting or destruction of trees and shrubs in violation of the terms of a forest management plan. We believe that we are in material
	compliance with the Forests Law and Decree-Law No. 701.




	In June 2008, the Executive Office of the President of Chile presented to the
	Chilean Congress a bill that would create a Ministry of the Environment, a Superintendency of the Environment and a Service of Environmental Evaluation and would include substantial modifications to the Chilean Environmental Law. The bill is
	currently under review by the Chilean Congress.




	Law No. 20,283, published in the Official Gazette on July 30, 2008, provides a
	new policy for the management and conservation of native tree forests and forest development. Its purposes are the protection, recovery and improvement of native forests in order to guarantee both forest sustainability and environmental

	Table of Contents




	policy. This law establishes a fund for the conservation and sustainable management of native forests. According to the new law, owners of native forests are
	able to exploit them so long as they have a management plan approved by the National Forestry Corporation. Depending on the owners approved plan, as well as other factors, the subsidy provided by the fund may vary between U.S.$200
	and U.S.$400 per hectare. The law also prohibits the harvesting of native trees in certain areas and under certain conditions. Management believes that this law will not have a material effect on our business. Currently, we do not perform clear
	cutting of native forest or any cutting in areas protected by the law, including the area surrounding rivers and streams, areas of notable environmental interest or areas with particularly fragile soil conditions.




	All of our forest activities are ISO 14001 certified. During 2003, we obtained the certification in Chile from CERTFOR, and in 2004, CERTFOR undertook
	its first audit of our operations and confirmed that we complied with CERTFOR requirements.

	See

	Item 4. Information on the CompanyDescription of BusinessForestry Activity.




	In 2005, CERTFOR certified the chain of custody of the Arauco, Constitución, Licancel and Valdivia pulp mills and Arauco and Nueva Aldea plywood
	mills, pursuant to the Sustainable Forestry Management practices, which require that sources used for production are not endangered or that their use is not otherwise prohibited. The National Regulatory Institute (

	Instituto Nacional de
	Normalización

	) also accredited the effluent laboratories of the Constitución and Arauco wood mills in accordance with the strict requirements of Chilean environmental standards.





	Argentina





	The management and
	exploitation of forests in Argentina is regulated by National Law 13,273, National Law 25,080, National Decree 710, Provincial Law No. 854, Provincial Law No. 3,426 and other regulations promulgated thereunder, which collectively
	constitute the regulatory framework. The regulatory framework imposes a variety of restrictions on the management and exploitation of forests in Argentina. The regulatory framework regulates the replanting of land after harvesting. We believe that
	our Argentine operations are in material compliance with the regulatory framework.





	Brazil





	Environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and exploitation of forests and the protection of Brazilian plant and wildlife govern our
	Brazilian forestry operations. Under this regulatory framework Brazilian authorities establish forest preservation areas and regulate replanting of forests after harvesting. We believe that our Brazilian operations are in material compliance with
	the regulatory framework.

Celulosa Arauco y Constitución (also called CELCO or ARAUCO) is a Chilean wood pulp, engineered wood and forestry company controlled by Anacleto Angelini's economic group; Empresas Copec. In 2006 CELCO/ARAUCO had five pulp mills in Chile and one in Argentina. Apart from pulp mills, CELCO/ARAUCO has 4 engineered wood manufacturing plants in Chile, 2 in Argentina and 2 in Brazil.
The company was founded in September 1979 as result of the fusion of Celulosa Arauco S.A. (1967) and Celulosa Constitución S.A. (1969). Both companies had been privatized during the Pinochet Era from CORFO in 1977 and 1979 respectively.

Investments[edit]
In May 2009 Arauco and the Finnish company Stora Enso announced a € 253 million deal that would make their joint venture the largest landowner in Uruguay.[1]
In September 2009 Arauco purchased the Brazilian panel company Tafisa Brasil in a deal worth US$227m.[2]
Pollution controversies[edit]
Valdivia[edit]
Main article: Valdivia Pulp Mill
Beginning in 2004, and just months after the opening of CELCO's Valdivia plant, thousands of black-necked swans in the internationally protected Ramsar site and national reserve Carlos Anwandter in Chile died or migrated. The Valdivia pulp mill, located upriver, was widely blamed. The mill is located near the city of Mariquina and discharges directly into the Cruces River which feeds the wetlands. The company had been dumping more dioxins and heavy metals than had been approved by the regulating agencies into the river from a waste tube that had been approved by the authorities. It had also been producing far above levels approved in its Environmental Impact Assessment, and was cited for multiple violations of environmental and health laws.[3] The scandal prompted Celco's chief executive to resign in June 2005 and the company to pledge to adopt cleaner technologies. The plant was temporarily closed by authorities but then allowed to reopen two months later at limited production capacity. Several legal actions were finally settled in the company's favor at the Chilean Supreme Court. However, it later was revealed that this decision was based on a report that CELCO had itself produced and falsely claimed was authored by the University of Concepcion. This caused Chile's president Ricardo Lagos to declare that the company had gone too far and was harming the country's image.[4]
A report contracted by the Chilean government to the regional university (Universidad Austral de Chile) found that the company's pollution was responsible for rapid ecological change in the wetlands leading to the decline of populations of swans and other water birds.[5] This finding was reviewed and validated by other independent entities including an international commission organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).[6] However, scientists at the Pontifical Catholic University funded by CELCO have disputed the causality between the plant's pollution and the swan population decline. In July 2007 CELCO agreed to pay CLP$614 millions to Valdivian tourism companies to avoid legal actions for supposed losses of the tourism sector of Valdivia due to contamination of Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary. In a document signed by the tourism companies CELCO was exempted from all responsibility involving the contamination of Cruces River. CELCO also promised to pay CLP$2 million monthly for three years to promote tourism.[7] Chile's equivalent of an Attorney General's office was suing the company to compensate for the environmental harm done. By 2012 the black-necked swan population had still not recovered beyond a few hundred individuals, down from its estimated population of 7,000 individuals before the crisis.
Mataquito[edit]
In December 1999 the pulp mill Licancel (located in the coast of Curicó, Maule Region) was accused of causing the death of hundreds of fish due to the dumping of wastewater into Mataquito River.[8] In June 2007 Licancel once again caused the death of fish in the river. The sanitary authorities ordered a temporary closure of the plant for 30 days, and CELCO dismissed three executives. Two weeks later 200,000 liters (44,000 imp gal; 53,000 U.S. gal) of industrial waste water escaped from a broken pipeline, of which 50,000 reached the river. CELCO said that it was an industrial accident, that they would close the plant until further notice, and that the spill would not have any impact on the environment. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, despite having large financial and technical resources, CELCO had an extremely poor environmental record.[9]

Celulosa Arauco y Constitución (also called CELCO or ARAUCO) is a Chilean wood pulp, engineered wood and forestry company controlled by Anacleto Angelini's economic group; Empresas Copec. In 2006 CELCO/ARAUCO had five pulp mills in Chile and one in Argentina. Apart from pulp mills, CELCO/ARAUCO has 4 engineered wood manufacturing plants in Chile, 2 in Argentina and 2 in Brazil.
The company was founded in September 1979 as result of the fusion of Celulosa Arauco S.A. (1967) and Celulosa Constitución S.A. (1969). Both companies had been privatized during the Pinochet Era from CORFO in 1977 and 1979 respectively.

Investments[edit]
In May 2009 Arauco and the Finnish company Stora Enso announced a € 253 million deal that would make their joint venture the largest landowner in Uruguay.[1]
In September 2009 Arauco purchased the Brazilian panel company Tafisa Brasil in a deal worth US$227m.[2]
Pollution controversies[edit]
Valdivia[edit]
Main article: Valdivia Pulp Mill
Beginning in 2004, and just months after the opening of CELCO's Valdivia plant, thousands of black-necked swans in the internationally protected Ramsar site and national reserve Carlos Anwandter in Chile died or migrated. The Valdivia pulp mill, located upriver, was widely blamed. The mill is located near the city of Mariquina and discharges directly into the Cruces River which feeds the wetlands. The company had been dumping more dioxins and heavy metals than had been approved by the regulating agencies into the river from a waste tube that had been approved by the authorities. It had also been producing far above levels approved in its Environmental Impact Assessment, and was cited for multiple violations of environmental and health laws.[3] The scandal prompted Celco's chief executive to resign in June 2005 and the company to pledge to adopt cleaner technologies. The plant was temporarily closed by authorities but then allowed to reopen two months later at limited production capacity. Several legal actions were finally settled in the company's favor at the Chilean Supreme Court. However, it later was revealed that this decision was based on a report that CELCO had itself produced and falsely claimed was authored by the University of Concepcion. This caused Chile's president Ricardo Lagos to declare that the company had gone too far and was harming the country's image.[4]
A report contracted by the Chilean government to the regional university (Universidad Austral de Chile) found that the company's pollution was responsible for rapid ecological change in the wetlands leading to the decline of populations of swans and other water birds.[5] This finding was reviewed and validated by other independent entities including an international commission organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).[6] However, scientists at the Pontifical Catholic University funded by CELCO have disputed the causality between the plant's pollution and the swan population decline. In July 2007 CELCO agreed to pay CLP$614 millions to Valdivian tourism companies to avoid legal actions for supposed losses of the tourism sector of Valdivia due to contamination of Carlos Anwandter Nature Sanctuary. In a document signed by the tourism companies CELCO was exempted from all responsibility involving the contamination of Cruces River. CELCO also promised to pay CLP$2 million monthly for three years to promote tourism.[7] Chile's equivalent of an Attorney General's office was suing the company to compensate for the environmental harm done. By 2012 the black-necked swan population had still not recovered beyond a few hundred individuals, down from its estimated population of 7,000 individuals before the crisis.
Mataquito[edit]
In December 1999 the pulp mill Licancel (located in the coast of Curicó, Maule Region) was accused of causing the death of hundreds of fish due to the dumping of wastewater into Mataquito River.[8] In June 2007 Licancel once again caused the death of fish in the river. The sanitary authorities ordered a temporary closure of the plant for 30 days, and CELCO dismissed three executives. Two weeks later 200,000 liters (44,000 imp gal; 53,000 U.S. gal) of industrial waste water escaped from a broken pipeline, of which 50,000 reached the river. CELCO said that it was an industrial accident, that they would close the plant until further notice, and that the spill would not have any impact on the environment. The Secretary of State for the Environment said that, despite having large financial and technical resources, CELCO had an extremely poor environmental record.[9]
