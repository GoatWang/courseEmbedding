Todd  Kingma
In 2013,  Perrigo Company landed comfortably high on Forbes’s list of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. The generic pharmaceutical manufacturer earned the 22nd spot with a strong portfolio of businesses, products, services, and processes. More important, the company has the chops to continue growing.

Todd KingmaExecutve Vice President, General Counsel & SecretaryPERRIGOVITALS: Todd Kingma learned from an early age the value of customer service. When he got to college, he gave himself the options of law and medical school. He focused on medically related issues in his first private practice gig and was able to continue satisfying both interests when he went in-house with a pharmaceutical company. He has stayed on that track for the last 23 years.
At Perrigo, innovation isn’t relegated to R&D, and Todd Kingma sees it emerge naturally within the legal team. Half of the general counsel’s responsibilities involve partnering with his business colleagues to develop strategy and support business development—a balance his current and former CEOs encouraged—but his whole objective for the legal department, in order to support business development, is strategic.
Kingma came to Perrigo in 2003 after serving for 12 years with Pharmacia Corporation, which merged with Pfizer in 2003. Initially, Pfizer offered Kingma impressive resources (its legal budget exceeded Perrigo’s total revenue at the time), but he was drawn to Perrigo’s potential despite being a small company. “At first I had to role up my sleeves and do a lot myself,” Kingma says.
“But Perrigo had an exciting vision that made sense to me: to expand in the health-care arena and focus on quality, affordable health care. The health-care debate was as alive and well then as it is today, and I thought Perrigo could be a part of the solution to a very real health-care problem.”
In the decade he has been with Perrigo, Kingma has seen the business grow 500 percent, from an $800 million shop with 2,800 employees to a $4 billion enterprise with a staff of approximately 10,000.
Perrigo has expanded through innovative organic and inorganic growth. It has a wide range of prescription and over-the-counter products that you would expect from a pharmaceutical company, but while most people don’t think affordable health care and quality issues apply to pet health, Perrigo is making the case for the opposite. “We recently acquired two businesses, [Sergeant’s Pet Care Products, Inc. and Velcera, Inc.], in that space,” says Kingma, who is part of the executive committee that is responsible for designing and implementing the company’s strategy. Pet products are not the only channel through which Perrigo is creatively diversified. In the last four years, it has also broken into the infant-nutrition and diabetes-care markets. Obviously, legal’s role in an acquisitive business is paramount, but Kingma says he and his team are present long before and after the ink has dried on such contracts.

 “Make sure your vision is not clouded by the circumstances so that you never lose sight of the right thing to do.” 

Because of the nature of its products, Perrigo relies on Kingma and his team to keep the business compliant in the heavily regulated health-care, food, and drug industries. To the company’s credit, Kingma says Perrigo has never had any material compliance issues—it has not paid any material fines, issued any material recalls, or suffered a quality-related shutdown, as some competitors have.
“Our business is very sound, but we don’t want to assume that everything will be fine tomorrow,” Kingma says. “We have to continually challenge our assumptions and traditional business models. We don’t want to avoid issues, and we’re not afraid to toss out ideas—even if they are out of the box. The legal team is at virtually every important stage of the business process working with our colleagues to make things happen.”
One of the biggest and most recent steps the company has taken to ensure its portfolio continues to bear the earmarks of an innovative enterprise is its $8.6 billion acquisition of Elan Corporation, an Irish biotechnology company. Concluding that acquisition before the end of 2013 was a significant achievement for Perrigo and its legal team. While the subsequent integration of Elan will obviously contribute to Perrigo’s growth, the company expects to see continued growth from its core business, which Kingma says receives equal attention from his team.
“As we look to the future, we want to continue to strike a balance between organic and inorganic growth,” he says. “The legal team will be a significant contributor to both aspects of growth. Anyone can identify issues, but working side-by-side with our business colleagues has allowed us to be strategic partners.”

KALAMAZOO, MI — At the Watercooler is a regular listing of announcements from Southwest Michigan businesses, individuals and organizations.
WORTH PRAISE
Todd W. Kingma
-Corporate Secretary Magazine has awarded Perrigo Co. PLC and West Michigan attorney Todd W. Kingma, executive vice president and general counsel for Perrigo, the highest honors in two categories in the area of Corporate Governance and Compliance. The national Corporate Governance Awards, established in 2007, are designed to recognize outstanding disclosure in corporate governance, risk and compliance. The Perrigo-specific recognition was Best Overall Governance Compliance and Ethics program, while Kingma was recognized as Governance Professional of the Year, with both awards in the large cap company category. Some of the other companies recognized include Target, PepsiCo, General Electric, Intel and Chevron. The Corporate Governance Awards are judged by a panel of governance and compliance experts from all parts of the governance arena. Perrigo is a leading manufacturer of store-brand pharmaceutical and nutritional products.

The Association along with community support raised $9,144 in cash donations and collected more than 90 backpacks and 3,000 personal items to help Berrien, Van Buren & Cass Foster Children. The fundraiser benefits area foster children under the supervision of the Michigan Department of Human Services in Berrien, Van Buren, and Cass Counties. Many of the children have very little or no personal items that they can take with them when they are moved into foster care. So the new backpacks, new clothing and personal healthcare items make a huge impact during a sad and confusing time for foster children.
WORTH NOTING
-Borgess Heart Center for Excellence, Borgess Heart Institute, has received a three-year term of accreditation in echocardiography in the area of adult transthoracic and adult stress by the Intersocietal Accreditation Commission. Borgess is recognized by the IAC for providing quality patient care, in compliance with national standards through a comprehensive application process, including detailed case study review. The IAC accreditation is a "seal of approval" to inform patients that Borgess Heart Center for Excellence has been carefully critiqued on all aspects of its operations considered relevant by medical experts in the field of echocardiography.
-J.M. Wilson recently announced it has created a dedicated brokerage department. While the department is new, underwriting brokerage accounts is not new to J.M. Wilson, a Managing General Agency and surplus lines broker providing independent insurance agents access to specialty markets for both personal and commercial lines. The department is being staffed by experienced underwriters who have longterm relationships with many brokerage insurance carriers and enjoy the challenge of finding coverage on unique risks. They are focused solely on brokerage accounts. J.M. Wilson has branch and affiliate offices in eight states.
-Shouldice Brothers, R.W. LaPine Inc., Lounsbury's Excavating Inc. and Circuit Electric Inc. have been named CSM Group's 2014 Key Performer Award recipients. They were announced at the 2014 Contractor Appreciation Event on Nov. 25 at Bell's Brewery. According to CSM Group, a Kalamazoo-based construction-management firm, the companies demonstrate dedication to excellence in the 9-year-old CSM Select program, and have performed in the top 1 percent of all eligible candidates. Since the inception of the CSM Select program, the company has been consistently rating all of its trade contractor partners with a 14 point grading system on a monthly basis. The program is intended to provide trade contractors constructive feedback in order to improve overall performance within the industry. Other key trade contractor partners that were recognized at the event include: Buist Electric; Overhead Door Co. of Kalamazoo; J&L Electric Inc.; Earley & Associates Inc.; Bracy & Jahr Inc.; Associated Painting Corp.; Migala Carpet One; Stafford Smith Inc.; Cook Jackson; Battle Creek Tile & Mosaic Co.

At the Watercooler — includes the widest variety of general interest business announcements, everything from trade industry awards to staff recertifications. Things that might be included: awards; notices of recognition from an industry trade association; election to a local, regional, state or national business organization; significant changes in business hours; the change of a business location.
Also included are announcements of new businesses in our readership area. With some zigs and zags, that runs from Allegan County in the north, to the Indiana border in the south, and from the Lake Michigan shoreline in the west to just the other side of the Calhoun County border in the east. We require the name of the enterprise, its location, a brief description of the business it conducts, the name(s) of the owner(s) and, where applicable, its hours of operation.
