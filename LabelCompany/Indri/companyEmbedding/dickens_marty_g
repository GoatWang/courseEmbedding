Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Since it was first published in 1843, Charles Dickens's beloved story of the transformation of Ebenezer Scrooge has enchanted generations of readers and listeners. Now this fine coloring book version invites colorists to bring to life the story of the greedy, grasping, cold-hearted old miser whose life is forever changed by three ghostly visitors on Christmas Eve.Twenty-one charmingly rendered scenes accompany Dickens's own abridged version of the tale, which he read to delighted audiences of his time. Among the illustrations are ready-to-color vignettes of Marley's ghost confronting a terrified Scrooge, Christmas dinner with the Cratchit household, the ghosts of Christmases past, present, and future, and many more.A perfect stocking stuffer for the holiday season, this entertaining and fun-to-color book will captivate youngsters ― and colorists of all ages ― throughout the year.


Author Bio▼▲
After a childhood blighted by poverty, commercial success came early to Charles Dickens (1812–70). By the age of 24, he was an international sensation whose new novels were eagerly anticipated. Two centuries later, Dickens's popularity endures as readers revel in the warm humanity and rollicking humor of his tales of self-discovery.One of Dover's most gifted and versatile artists, Marty Noble is the creator of over 200 Dover items, including regular and stained glass books, stickers, tattoos, stencils, CD-ROMs, and more. Marty has also expertly re-created the art for most of the "Color Your Own . . . " series.

            I colored this book through out  the month of December!  This was a nice addition to the latest trend in Adult coloring books.  This one is not too hard and does not have the fine detail of many of the adult coloring books on the market, which makes it ideal for all ages.  The pages are nice and sturdy, but are not made to be removed from the book.  The story is also included and was fun to read along as you colored each page.  I actually bought several and gave as gifts!  My one friend, who loves Dickens, was very pleasantly surprised!
