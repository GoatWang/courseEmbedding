Young investors on the takeover  trail 
The Globe and Mail, Tuesday,  December 14, 2010
To play in  Canada’s fractured private equity market, investors must go head-to-head with  huge established funds for big businesses, or battle venture-capital players  for small but promising startups. But there’s an untapped middle ground, one  that a different breed of investment fund is designed to access. So-called  “search funds” seek out flourishing, small-to-medium-sized enterprises that want  to sell but can’t find buyers. And thanks to a growing wave of retirements by  baby boomer entrepreneurs, the number of these firms is growing. These  enterprises are too small to attract attention from big players like the Canada  Pension Plan Investment Board, and too big to interest venture capitalists, but  they can be attractive investments that boast reliable cash flow coupled with  lower risk. “The level of risk, I think, is substantially reduced compared to  the venture capital market” because the businesses are established, said Paul  Rogers, a former president at CIBC World Markets in New York, who recently  invested in one of the newest entrants in the search-fund market, Toronto-based  Auxo Management. Auxo was started this year by Canadians Rob Cherun and Erik  Mikkelsen.

New search fund rolls dice in Canada 
The Globe and Mail, Tuesday,  December 14, 2010 
            Rob Cherun  and Erik Mikkelsen were already living their dream, working in investment  banking, management consulting and real estate private equity out of New York,  Toronto and Los Angeles. But that wasn’t enough for Mr. Cherun, who enrolled in  his MBA at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business in 2008. There he met  professor Joel Peterson, founder of private equity firm Peterson Partners and  current chairman of JetBlue Airways Corp. Mr. Cherun took Mr. Peterson’s class  and prepared a report on the value of investing in Canada. The document was  compelling, noting that Canada has the world’s second-largest oil reserves,  large timber reserves, a strong dollar, and low debt-to-GDP. More important for  private equity investors, he found that Canada has about a quarter of the money  chasing smaller companies than in the U.S., on a per-capita basis.

Postmedia News, Wednesday December 15, 2010  
            After slowing to a crawl, Canada’s economy is expected to get back on track in  2011 on expectations for sustained domestic growth and an improved outlook for  the United States, according to reports Wednesday by two of Canada’s major  banks. TD Economics boosted its growth forecast for the year ahead to 2.6 per  cent from two per cent previously.

Think Canada (Again) 
CVCA – Canada’s Venture  Capital & Private Equity Association, October 2010 
            The Canadian economy is  vibrant, has been outperforming the rest of the G7 and is ranked by the  Economic Intelligence Unit as the #1 place to do business in the G7 for the  next five years. KPMG surveys find Canada leading the G7 in low business costs,  especially taxes. The World Economic Forum placed Canada at the top of the  rankings for streamlining procedures to set up a business and #1 for the  soundness of its banks since 2008. Canada is open for business! Canada’s educated workforce (ranked #1 in the OECD for  college completion rates and #3 for the quality of its management schools),  abundant natural resources, and easy access to major markets place it in an  exceptionally competitive favorable position. The public policy environment is  strongly supportive of innovation with Canada #2 in the G7 in the generosity of  total R&D tax incentives. In addition to fiscal support, the Government has  also provided support by acting as a catalyst to assist in the  commercialization of innovation.

The new business as usual – The  Business Insights Survey of Canadian Companies 2010 
PWC, 2010 
            The 2010 PwC Business Insights  Survey of Canadian Private Companies reveals most of Canada’s private companies  are ready to grow. They’ve learned their lessons from the recession, took the  time to improve processes and bring cost structures down, and are setting a  strategic path forward, one that is based on a model of continuous improvement,  a deep and robust relationship with customers and a keen eye on the  competition. While they have benefitted from Canada’s overall strength  throughout the economic downturn, they are also fully aware of the implications  a struggling US economy can have on the Canadian market.
