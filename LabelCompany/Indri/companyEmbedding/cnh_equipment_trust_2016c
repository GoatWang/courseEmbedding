ARTICLE II
 

CONVEYANCE OF
RECEIVABLES
 

Section 2.1.
                                                             
Conveyance of
Receivables . 
In consideration of CNHCR’s payment of $752,285,518.96 (the
“Purchase Price”) in the manner set out in
Section 2.5(a), and the other consideration (including the
terms and covenants) contained herein, CNHICA does hereby sell,
transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to CNHCR, without
recourse (subject to the obligations herein), all of its right,
title, interest in, to and under (collectively, the “CNHICA
Assets”):
 

(i)                                     
the Receivables, including all
documents constituting chattel paper included therewith, and all
obligations of the Obligors thereunder, including all monies paid
thereunder on or after the Cutoff Date;
 

(ii)                                  
the security interests in the
Financed Equipment granted by Obligors pursuant to the Receivables
and any other interest of CNHICA in such Financed
Equipment;
 

(iii)                               
any proceeds with respect to the
Receivables from claims on insurance policies covering Financed
Equipment or Obligors (to the extent not used to purchase
Substitute Equipment);
 

(iv)                              
any proceeds from recourse to
Dealers with respect to the Receivables;
 

(v)                                 
any Financed Equipment that shall
have secured the Receivables and that shall have been acquired by
or on behalf of CNHCR; and
 





 

(vi)                              
the proceeds of any and all of the
foregoing.
 

Section 2.2.
                                                             
[Reserved]
 

Section 2.3.
                                                             
Intention of the
Parties .  The
parties to this Agreement intend that the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be, and shall be treated as, a purchase by CNHCR and a
sale by CNHICA of the Receivables and not as a lending transaction,
such that in the event of a filing of a petition for relief by or
against CNHICA under the Bankruptcy Code, (i) such Receivables
would not be property of CNHICA’s bankruptcy estate under
Section 541 of the Bankruptcy Code, (ii) the bankruptcy
court would not compel the turnover of such Receivables or
collections thereon by CNHCR to CNHICA under Section 542 of
the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) the bankruptcy court would
determine that payments on such Receivables not in the possession
of CNHICA would not be subject to the automatic stay provisions of
Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code imposed upon the
commencement of CNHICA’s bankruptcy case.  The foregoing
sale, assignment, transfer and conveyance does not constitute, and
is not intended to result in a creation or assumption by CNHCR of,
any obligation or liability with respect to any Receivables, nor
shall CNHCR be obligated to perform or otherwise be responsible for
any obligation of CNHICA or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables or under any agreement or instrument relating thereto,
including any contract or any other obligation to any
Obligor.  If (but only to the extent that) the transfer of the
Assets hereunder is characterized by a court or other governmental
authority as a loan rather than a sale, CNHICA shall be deemed
hereunder to have granted to CNHCR a security interest in all of
CNHICA’s right, title and interest in and to the
Assets.  Such security interest shall secure all of
CNHICA’s obligations (monetary or otherwise) under this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents to which it is a party,
whether now or hereafter existing or arising, due or to become due,
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent.  CNHCR shall have,
with respect to the property described in Section 2.1, and in
addition to all the other rights and remedies available to CNHCR
under this Agreement and applicable law, all the rights and
remedies of a secured party under any applicable UCC, and this
Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable
law.
 

Section 2.4.
                                                             
The Closing
.  The sale and purchase of the
Receivables shall take place at a closing at the offices of
Greenberg Traurig, LLP, 77 West Wacker Drive, Suite 3100,
Chicago, Illinois  60601 on the Closing Date,
simultaneously with the closings under:  (a) the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, (b) the Trust Agreement, (c) the
Administration Agreement and (d) the Indenture.
 

Section 2.5.
                                                             
Payment of the Purchase
Price .
 

(a)                                 
Receivables.
  The Purchase Price is payable
in cash in an amount of $752,285,518.96 on the Closing
Date.
 

Section 2.6.
                                                             
Cross-Collateralization
.  To the extent CNHICA retains
any interest in any item of Financed Equipment securing the
repayment of any Receivable, as a result of the related Obligor
agreeing to cross-collateralize all obligations owed by such
Obligor to CNHICA or otherwise, CNHICA acknowledges and agrees that
its interest in the Financed Equipment shall be expressly
subordinate and junior in priority to the repayment of all amounts
outstanding under such Receivable prior to becoming available to
pay any amount outstanding under any
 





 
other obligation owed by such Obligor to
CNHICA.  CNHICA hereby represents, warrants and covenants that
NH Credit has not retained, and will not retain, any interest in
any item of Financed Equipment securing the repayment of any
Receivable, whether as a result of the related Obligor agreeing to
cross-collateralize obligations or otherwise.

(b)                                 
CNHICA makes the following
representations and warranties as to the Receivables on which CNHCR
relies in accepting the Receivables and in transferring the
Receivables to the Trust.  Such representations and warranties
speak as of the Closing Date, but shall survive the sale, transfer
and assignment of the Receivables to CNHCR and the subsequent
assignment and transfer of such Receivables to the Trust pursuant
to the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Grant to the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to the Indenture:
 

(i)                                     
Characteristics of
Receivables.   Each
Receivable is a Retail Installment Contract and: 
(A) (1) (i) was originated in the United States of
America by a Dealer in connection with the retail sale of Financed
Equipment in the ordinary course of such Dealer’s business,
and (ii) was purchased by CNHICA from a Dealer and validly
assigned by such Dealer to CNHICA in accordance with its terms,
except that some of the Receivables were purchased by NH Credit
from Dealers (after being originated as provided above),
securitized in a previous CNH Equipment Trust and purchased by
CNHICA through the exercise of a clean-up call relating to that
previous securitization or (2) was originated in the United
States of America by CNHICA in connection with the financing or
refinancing, as applicable, of Financed Equipment in the ordinary
course of CNHICA’s business, and in the case of the foregoing
clauses (1) and (2), was fully and properly executed by the
parties thereto, (B) has created a valid, subsisting and
enforceable first priority security interest in the Financed
Equipment in favor of CNHICA except to the extent that such
security interest has been assigned by CNHICA to CNHCR, by CNHCR to
the Issuing Entity and by the Issuing Entity to the Indenture
Trustee, (C) contains customary and enforceable provisions
such that the rights and remedies of the holder thereof are
adequate for realization against the collateral of the benefits of
the security, and (D) provides for fixed payments on a
periodic basis that fully amortize the Amount Financed by maturity
and yield interest at the Annual Percentage Rate.
 





 

(ii)                                  
Schedule of Receivables; No
Adverse Selection of Receivables; Accuracy of Computer
Tape.   The
information set forth on Schedule A to the CNHICA Assignment
delivered on the Closing Date is true and correct in all material
respects as of the opening of business on the Cutoff Date.  No
selection procedures believed by CNHICA to be adverse to the
interests of the Trust, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders
were or will be utilized in selecting the Receivables.  The
computer tape regarding the Receivables made available to CNHCR and
its assigns is true and correct in all respects regarding the
characteristics of the Receivables.
 

(iii)                               
Compliance with Law.
  Each Receivable and the sale
of the related Financed Equipment complied in all material respects
at the time it was originated or made and at the execution of this
Agreement with all requirements of applicable federal, state and
local laws and regulations thereunder, including usury law, the
Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the
Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act,
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Regulations B and
Z, the Wisconsin Consumer Act and state adaptations of the National
Consumer Act and of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and other
consumer credit laws and equal credit opportunity and disclosure
laws, in each case, to the extent applicable.
 

(iv)                              
Binding Obligation.
  Each Receivable represents
the genuine, legal, valid and binding payment obligation in writing
of the Obligor, enforceable by the holder thereof in accordance
with its terms.
 

(v)                                 
No Government Obligor.
  None of the Receivables is
due from the United States of America or any state or from any
agency, department or instrumentality of the United States of
America or any state.
 

(vi)                              
Security Interest in Financed
Equipment.  
Immediately prior to the sale, assignment and transfer thereof,
each Receivable shall be secured by a validly perfected first
priority security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor of
CNHICA as secured party or all necessary and appropriate actions
have been commenced that would result in the valid perfection of a
first priority security interest in the Financed Equipment in favor
of CNHICA as secured party.
 

(vii)                           
Receivables in Force.
  No Receivable has been
satisfied, subordinated or rescinded, nor has any Financed
Equipment been released from the Lien granted by the related
Receivable in whole or in part (other than with respect to
equipment released from a Lien in accordance with the Servicing
Procedures).
 

(viii)                        
No Amendment or
Waiver.   No
provision of a Receivable has been waived, altered or modified in
any respect, except pursuant to a document, instrument or writing
included in the Receivable Files and no such amendment, waiver,
alteration or modification causes such Receivable not to conform to
the other warranties contained in this Section.
 

(ix)                              
No Defenses.
  No right of rescission,
setoff, counterclaim or defense has been asserted or threatened or
exists with respect to any Receivable.
 






 

(x)                                 
No Liens.   To the best of CNHICA’s knowledge,
no Liens or claims, including claims for work, labor or materials,
relating to any of the Financed Equipment have been filed that are
Liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the security interest
in the Financed Equipment granted by any Receivable, except those
pursuant to the Basic Documents.
 

(xi)                              
No Default; Delinquency
Limitations.   No
Receivable is a non-performing Receivable or has a payment that is
more than 90 days overdue as of the Cutoff Date and, except for a
payment default continuing for a period of not more than 90 days,
no default, breach, violation or event permitting acceleration
under the terms of any Receivable has occurred and is continuing;
and no continuing condition (other than a payment default
continuing for a period of not more than 90 days) that with notice
or the lapse of time would constitute such a default, breach,
violation or event permitting acceleration under the terms of any
Receivable has arisen; and CNHICA has not waived any of the
foregoing.  Receivables that are considered
“delinquent” (as defined in Item 1101(d) of
Regulation AB) constitute less than 20% of the aggregate
Statistical Contract Value of all of the Trust’s Receivables
as of the Cutoff Date.
 

(xii)

A purchase and sale agreement is a document used in real estate transactions, when a seller property owner (''Seller'') sells a property to a company or individual (''Buyer''). This document outlines the terms and conditions of transaction. Information contained in the document includes the names of both parties, the address and description of the property the agreement concerns, and the purchase price. The closing details of the transaction are included in the document outlining where and when closing on the property shall occur. When purchasing a property, particularly with a cash payment, a real estate investor may provide earnest money as a deposit. This information will be present in the contract and will include details on the amount and how it shall be paid to the seller. If a loan is being used to purchase the property, details of the lender and the amount will be included in the document.There may be clauses regarding property taxes and disclosures of potential issues of the property.  If the seller agrees to perform certain repairs before transfer of ownership to the buyer, the repairs may be contained within the agreement. Some buyers may request fixtures or furnishings along with the sale of the property, and these will be listed within the document.  A purchase and sale agreement may also contain warranties, waiver of claims, and information about the title insurance policy.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

CNH Equipment Trust 2016-C $752.36 Million Notes Assigned Preliminary Ratings
Stocks and Financial Services Press Releases Thursday September 8, 2016 09:07

NEW YORK--8 Sep--S&P Global Ratings
NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 7, 2016--S&P Global Ratings today assigned its preliminary ratings to CNH Equipment Trust 2016-C's $752.36 million asset-backed notes series 2016-C (see list).


The note issuance is an asset-backed securities transaction backed by equipment retail installment sales contracts.
The preliminary ratings are based on information as of Sept. 7, 2016. Subsequent information may result in the assignment of final ratings that differ from the preliminary ratings.
The preliminary ratings reflect:
The availability of approximately 7.90% and 6.07% credit support (based on stressed break-even cash flow scenarios) for the class A and B notes, respectively.
The credit support provides coverage of more than 5x and 4x the lower bound of our expected net loss range of 1.50%-1.75% for the class A and B notes, respectively.
The expectation that, under a moderate stress scenario of 2.0x our expected net loss level, the ratings on the class A and B notes will not decline by more than one or two rating categories, respectively, during the first year, all else being equal.
Our expectation of the timely payment of periodic interest and principal by the final maturity date according to the transaction documents based on stressed cash flow modeling scenarios, using assumptions commensurate with the assigned preliminary ratings.
The securitized equipment loan pool's collateral characteristics, taking into account the concentrations of agricultural equipment contracts and construction equipment contracts (87.29% and 12.71% of the pool balance, respectively).
Structural features that offset the liquidity risk associated with the pool's annual pay contracts (60.90% of the pool balance, but with some diversification by calendar month of when payments on annual pay contracts are due), including a cash reserve account that is initially funded at 2.25% of the initial pool balance and steps down (subject to performance triggers) but only to a 1.15% floor, and a discounting methodology that allows principal cash flows to be used to pay timely interest if needed.
CNH Industrial Capital America LLC's (CNH's) history of servicing 60 previous U.S. retail securitizations and management's lending experience through multiple cycles in the agricultural and construction equipment sectors.
The transaction's legal structure.
