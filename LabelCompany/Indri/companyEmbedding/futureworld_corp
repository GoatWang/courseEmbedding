              August 16, 2016 08:00 ET FutureWorld (FWDG) 2016 Year in Review Better Business Model, Better Investments & Better ROI August 16, 2016 08:00 ET  ST. PETERSBURG, FL--(Marketwired - August 16, 2016) - FutureWorld Corp (FWDG), a Cannabis technology incubator & accelerator, provides the following year in review to its shareholders.   Dear Shareholders; Cannabis industry is the fastest-growing industry in the United States and had its biggest year ever which could grow by another eight to 10 states in 2016. With the presidential election looming, there is guaranteed to be a massive voter turnout and the initiatives that are poised to include legalization of cannabis on the 2016 ballot stand a chance to make some big changes. The cannabis ballot initiatives could open the door to legalization in more states including Arizona, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan and Nevada in 2016. This rapid growth of the industry is a boom for ancillary products providers such as HempTech, CB Scientific, Bioceutical Sciences, NutraCann Labs and incubators such as FutureWorld Corp (FWDG). A majority of Americans continue to support full legalization, nationally, and by 2016, it's entirely possible that marijuana could be a wedge issue in the presidential election. On the industrial Hemp side, with the 2014 Agricultural Act (known as the Farm Bill) making year 2014 notable and celebrated, 2015 proved to be a year of record-setting, transformative strides within the industrial hemp industry. Laws governing industrial hemp continued to evolve in more and more states, making Industrial Hemp one of most lucrative opportunities to unfold over the course of the year and beyond. In short, the Cannabis industry will grow from $1.5 billion in 2014 to an estimated $35 billion in 2020.  Who We Are FutureWorld focuses on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of cannabis related products and services. As a Cannabis Technology Incubator and Accelerator, FutureWorld will incubate and fund leading technologies, products, and services for Cannabis industry (including Industrial Hemp) combining resources to strengthen the company and the industry. FutureWorld follows a well-tested business incubation model; the seed fund model. The seed fund model thesis is based on a combination of "high-quality filter" and "broad portfolio" approaches. The high-quality filter attempts to ensure that the very best minds, teams and ideas get into FWDG. The broad portfolio approach, statistically, discovers a few breakaway companies in order to provide the big returns to investors. So far the Company has funded 6 companies in 2015 and expects to fund more in 2016.  How We Make Money We make money by exiting our incubated companies through a sale, reverse merger, merger or an IPO. In any case, some or all of the proceeds, whether in stock or cash, will be returned to the shareholders as dividend. For FutureWorld, our main revenue is derived from cash and marketable securities through our exits. In most cases we own from 19% to 100% of the companies being incubated by FWDG. According GAAP, we would need to consolidate the financials of all the holdings until they are sold or spun off. Products or services revenue generation by our companies is not our business model, as an incubator, but only a successful exit will define our revenue stream.  Our Companies, Current and Future Results Four areas within the cannabis industry sector with the most accelerated growth for 2016 and beyond includes; Medicine - Accessories - Testing - Grow Delivery and Land Leasing. We have and will use this guide to incubate exciting companies for better ROI. All of our companies fall within all of these important areas;     Land Leasing FutureLand Corp - http://futurelandcorp.com/   Founded in September 2014, FutureLand Corp., a Colorado company, is a cannabis and hemp specialty zoned land leasing company formed to capitalize upon the emerging global cannabis market. FutureLand, focuses on target acquisition, zoning, license fulfillment, site plan preparation and financing of cannabis or hemp grow facilities throughout the United States. We give growers the opportunity to grow. Company monetizes through leasing the land, leasing the structures on the land, financing interest revenue and management fees associated with cultivation centers. FutureLand retains ownership of all the land and the structures. FutureLand leases to both medical marijuana, retail marijuana as well as industrial hemp growers. FutureLand does not currently grow, distribute or sell marijuana. Company has multiple projects across the USA and possible project in Jamaica.

The distribution company provides sales channels for CB Scientific, Bioceutical Sciences and any other businesses within FWDG universe and beyond. The company has had limited sales so far since we are in the beta stage. We have been experimenting on labeling and branding for new products. We will be introducing the brands shortly. We have high hopes for this company. NutraCann became part of CB Scientific with its IPO in April 2016.  These are the stats on this company; Founded - April 2015 Investment - $150K Revenue for 2015 - Less than $50K Achievements - Successfully tested CBD Vape blends, Tinctures and Pills sold on EBay, Amazon and its website.

We founded this company to get into the pharmaceutical aspect of the cannabis industry in which should be the biggest driver. The company develops, designs and manufactures Pharma grade Nutraceuticals for cancer, Alzheimer and life threatening illnesses for patients by proprietary formulations using cannabinoids derived from Cannabis. The company will also provide formulations and designs for NutraCann and CB Scientific. There are major funding requirement for this company which will come from PPM, grants and sales. Bioceutical Sciences became part of CB Scientific with its IPO in March 2016. This is one of most promising of our companies within the FWDG and cannabis universe. These are the stats on this company; Founded - May 2015 Investment - $45K Revenue since inception - Less than $30K Achievements - Formulated pre-pharmaceutical and Nutraceutical grade CBD blends, pills and tinctures for NutraCann labs.

Estimated 2016 revenue - Pro Forma Financials only available Estimated Exit - Became part of CB Scientific with its IPO in March 2016 Estimated Exit Type - Merged with CB Scientific (CBSC) Comparable company - Cannabis Sciences (CBIS), Cannabis Sativa (CBDS)      Magic Dragon Brands  Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/magicdragonhigh    Started in September 2015, Magic Dragon Brands is testing formulations for the Hempseed infused energy and chill drinks for the consumers under the brand "Magic Dragon High". Magic Dragon High Brands will initially produce Hempseed and Hemp based CBD infused beverages. According to new market data from Packaged Facts; the energy drinks sector comprises an increasing portion of the non-alcoholic beverage market, and as the sector, has grown 60% from 2008-2012 with a total U.S. sales of more than $12.5 billion in 2012. According to "Energy Drinks & Shots Market Trends in the U.S.", sales of energy drinks will grow to a value of $21.5 billion by 2017, driven by expansion in retail distribution, and strong potential in new product development.

FutureWorld was not immune to that decline either. For us, our stock price decline was caused not by our business activities but by the industry trends and our debt obligations. Although we cannot effect the industry trends, we are working hard in relieving our debts and use other methods in raising funds. As of this release, we have cut down most of our debts and have initiated equity funding plan through private placements to continue our growth and investments without dilutive funding obligations. In 2016, we should have sufficient marketable securities to become self-sufficient going forward. Unlike 2015, 2016 has been a great year for the industry due to many factors including corporate and industry maturity and nationwide acceptance of the cannabis industry. FutureWorld will be part of this lifting tides which will lift up companies with the best business models. As an only public cannabis incubator, our business model will ensure sustainability and profitability for 2016 and beyond.    2016 and Beyond We have four main objectives in 2016; prove our business model, increase our share price, return more value to our shareholders and invest better in exciting sectors of this growing industry including the ever emergent Hemp market. We intend to return value to our shareholders by stock and cash dividends in 2016.   On February 26, 2016, Shareholder (hereafter referred to as “Selling Holder” or by name) of Building Turbines, Inc. which is a publicly filed Nevada Company (BLDW), entered into a purchase and exchange agreement with FutureWorld Corp. (hereafter referred to as “FWDG”) a Delaware Corporation and its partially owned subsidiary HempTech Corp., (hereafter referred to as “HTC”), a Delaware Corporation, to deliver to FutureWorld, and HempTech Shareholders, the certain share holdings of Building Turbines, Inc., as an exchange for such consideration as set forth in the agreement.  Consideration for the purchase and exchange agreement shall be as follows (collectively the “Consideration”):      a. A purchase price paid for by the issuance of 62,500,950 shares of Common stock, par value $0.001, on the Closing Date (after recapitalization) to HempTech Corp shareholders. 			All such common shares shall be received of the BLDW common shares under the requisite restriction of Rule 144 of the Securities Act.          b. In return for those shares of BLDW as designated, the BLDW selling holder, John Graham, shall receive, post-reverse division, an amount of common shares of the Corporation which will be equal to nine and nine tenths percent (9.9%) of the total outstanding common shares of the Corporation (“Exchanged Shares”) after such reverse division occurs and the initial post-reverse issuance occurs. 			The amount of shares to be initially issued shall for such 9.9% of the total outstanding common shares after the reverse division shall be 6,187,594 common shares.     The Company has agreed, subject to certain exceptions with respect to unsolicited proposals, not to initiate, facilitate, solicit, encourage (including, without limitation, by way of furnishing non-public information) or accept any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, an “acquisition proposal” or engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions, communications or negotiations regarding an acquisition proposal.

	Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, including, without limitation, statements regarding our expectations, beliefs, intentions or future strategies that
	are signified by the words “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “believes,” “estimates”
	or similar language, and among other things:  (i) events that may occur in the future, (ii) implementation of our business
	model; development and marketing of our products and services and (iii) prospects for revenues and profitability.  All
	forward-looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof.  We
	caution investors that our business and financial performance and the matters described in these forward-looking statements are
	subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Because of these risks and uncertainties, some of which may not be currently
	ascertainable and many of which are beyond our control, actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
	statements. Deviations between actual future events and our estimates and assumptions could lead to results that are materially
	different from those expressed in or implied by the forward looking statements. We do not intend to update these forward looking
	statements to reflect actual future events.

	1. 	History of the Company and Nature of the Business



	 


	 


	 


	“We”, “us” and
	“our” refer to FutureWorld Corp., a Delaware corporation.


	 


	 


	On June 11, 2014, the Company changed its name to FutureWorld
	Corp.


	 


	 

	Nature of Business



	 


	The address of our executive offices is: 3637 4

	th

	Street North, Saint Petersburg, FL 33704 and our telephone number at that address is 427-474-1816. The address of our web site
	is www.futureworldcorp.com. The information at our web site is for general information and marketing purposes and is not part of
	this quarterly report for purposes of liability for disclosures under the federal securities laws.


	  


	FutureWorld Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a U.S. diversified
	Industrial Hemp/ Medical Cannabis Company, which together with its subsidiaries, focuses on the identification, acquisition, development,
	and commercialization of Hemp/Cannabis products, services and technologies globally under the banner of Cannabis 2.0.


	 


	We are seeking to acquire minority or full interest in currently
	operating companies and disruptive technologies in the Industrial Hemp/Medical and Recreational Cannabis Industry globally; such
	as vaporizers, lab testing, tracking systems, security, Cannabidiol (CBD) oil, testing kits, financial solutions, dispensaries
	and other needed components. Our goal is to provide our acquired companies, current and future shareholders a clear strategy for
	the growth of their companies and their investment in those companies.


	 


	We currently provide multiple products that supply
	the burgeoning cannabis industry. The “picks and shovel” business model capitalizes of selling enterprises associated
	with the Industrial Hemp and Medical Cannabis industries products that are essential in their success. Our products solve long
	standing problems in cultivation, processing, and retail sales for industrial hemp and medical cannabis. The following divisions
	will continue to delve even further into purchasing existing products or developing brand new products as the wholesale and retail
	space continues to evolve. In addition, one primary focus is to manufacture, market, and sell products containing hemp derived
	CBD oil. We are invested in the following portfolio companies as subsidiaries;


	 



	NutraCann Labs Inc.



	CBD Oil- CBD is one of at least 60 cannabinoids found
	in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. The Cannabidiol “CBD” is a compound in cannabis that has significant medical effects,
	but does not make people feel “high” and can actually counter the psychoactive effects of THC. The reduced psychotropic
	of CBD-rich cannabis makes it an appealing treatment option for patients seeking anti-inflammatory, anti-pain, anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic,
	and/or anti-spasm effects without disconcerting lethargy. Scientific and clinical studies underscore CBD’s potential as a
	treatment for a wide range of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, alcoholism, MS, chronic pain, schizophrenia,
	PTSD, antibiotic-resistant infections, epilepsy, and other neurological disorders. CBD has demonstrated neuro-protective and neurogenic
	effects, and its anti-cancer properties are currently being investigated at several academic research centers in the United States
	and elsewhere.



	The present usage for CBD
	oil in the United States is estimated to be approximately 1,000-2,000 Kilograms a year and growing and with a yearly value of around
	$200,000,000. Currently

	, the apparent current competitors are;

	CannaVest, Inc. and Medical Marijuana,
	Inc., which own portions of each other’s companies, are the primary supplier of CBD oil in the United States. They supply
	the product in bulk to affiliate distributors and sell it retail in plastic tubes that are refined up to three levels. Real Scientific
	Hemp Oil™ is their trademark name.



	NutraCann Labs has sourced its own CBD oil from Europe.
	We are also developing plans to fund an overseas hemp cultivation project to provide a consistent and reliable supply to the United
	States and beyond. Currently, industrial hemp cultivation is legal in twenty countries around the world. NutraCann’s products
	are sold under the brand name “cbdessence” on CBDESSENCE.COM.






	 









	 






	NutraCann Labs will process the CBD oils that

	will be sold through our online presence for retailing industrial hemp oil-based Cannabidiol (CBD) nutritional supplements, wellness
	and personal care products and vapable CBD oils. NutraCann Labs will market items such as CBD oil, CBD infused edibles & multiple
	hemp related items and cross market our vaporizers from URVape.com. NutraCann Labs will be featuring scientific grade hemp oil
	which is highly sought after around the world. We will sell already recognizable brands including our own brands and drive internet
	sales through ads, videos, social media and Search Engine Optimization.



	The global Nutraceutical market is projected to be
	in excess of $200 billion by 2015 and the current US Nutraceutical and Dietary supplement market is valued at around $42 billion.
	CBDESSENCE.com and URCBDOil.com will be at the forefront of this massive marketplace with significant opportunities. Cannabinoids
	(non-psychoactive CBD) have been found to have antioxidant properties, unrelated to NMDA receptor antagonism. This new found property
	makes cannabinoids useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of a wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic,
	age-related, inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.


	Cannabinoids are found to have particular application
	as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic events, such as stroke and trauma, or in the
	treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and HIV dementia. URCBDOil.com should be live by July
	1, 2014 UPDATE). CBDESSENCE.com and URCBDOil.com will assist FutureWorld to generate positive cash flow for both URVape and our
	CBD oil and CBD infused products offered by NutraCann Labs.



	CB Scientific, Inc.



	CB Scientific, Inc. a wholly owned subsidiary based
	in Denver Colorado has developed new technologies specifically for cannabis analytics. Charles Steinburg, President of Herbal Synergy
	and Acting Vice President of CB Scientific Division, has been one of the main men behind gas chromatography testing in Colorado.
	Charles Steinberg’s credentials will prove to be an asset to CB Scientific He has been a judge at several High Times Cannabis
	Cups. CB Scientific introduced the first ever personal cannabinoid detection kits. These kits test all your products in-house and
	at your own convenience. These tests are quick, easy, and effective. CB Scientific’s new PERSONALANALYTICS THC & CBD
	detection kit is the first simple, quick and accurate consumer THC & CBD test which will give you’re an accurate reading
	of THC or CBD in any product you purchase, manufacture, or grow While many medical and recreational products are sold with cannabinoid
	levels listed, these numbers are often not representative of what is being sold.



	URVape, Inc.



	URVape™ is our brand name vaporizer pen which
	is sold with a charger and refill bottles. We market the product at URVape.com. It is our own trademarked vaporizer being marketed
	and sold online and in retail shops. The product is cutting edge design and requires puffing on the pen to facilitate battery use.
	The URVape vaporizing pen is sleek and lightweight. URVape will initially have oil vaporizers available and dry herb versions available
	in the coming months.


	URVape was started to contribute to the current revolution,
	which has become an international phenomenon, known as the "Vaping" industry. URVape began test marketing OEM branded,
	off-the-shelf oil vaporizers, whose design and utility was well received, and which promulgated our first vendor agreement in the
	state of Colorado.


	After studying the marketplace, with more than 466
	vendors attempting to reach nicotine consumers, we recognized early on that there were unsupported claims and deficiencies in the
	products and e-liquids being sold. Product deficiencies were noted in the devices being used in combination with e-liquids, which,
	together could be producing harmful elements. Consequently, these elements are being inhaled as a result of heating the contents
	of the e-liquids, thereby producing potentially harmful changes to the initial ingredients. As a result, URVape has dedicated itself
	to providing products that are free of any substances which, when heated for vaping, could be harmful.


	URVape has entered into an exclusive Non-disclosure/Non-compete
	contract with one of the foremost international vaping products manufacturers. Through our in-house Product Development personnel,
	and through the hiring of a consultant whose area of expertise is microbiology, specific to cannabis and vaping, we have developed
	two primary device changes that are being patented. These changes are designed to produce safe devices, built with safe materials,
	and to exact temperature specifications suited to a variety of e-liquids that we will bring to market.


	We are also developing new methods of producing, packaging
	and flavoring a variety of e-liquids with the intention to provide consumers with happy, healthy and potentially curative products.


	 


	URVape’s plans include the installation of its
	own laboratory along with a "clean room" for production of its products. The goal is to become the market leader of safe
	vaping materials. To that end, URVape has Trademarked "SafeVape" for use in describing the technologies utilized in bringing
	both devices and e-liquids to the marketplace.






	 









	 






	The E-cigarette, Cannabis and Herbal vaping industry
	is an ever growing and evolving industry. Business models need to be constantly adjusted and configured based on all moving parts.
	But we are fortunate to be part of this historical moment in time where consumers around the globe will finally have access to
	natural plant derivatives to enhance their health and enjoyment without the inherent side effects of synthetic medicines. URVape
	will be part of that historical moment creating technologies for the delivery of its specialized, researched products. With the
	decriminalization and legalization of cannabis for medicinal and recreational use in many states and countries throughout the world
	the adoption of electronic vaporizing by the world’s 1.2 Billion smokers - eCig or vaporizer market is the fastest market
	within the tobacco (free) industry and estimated to be a multi-billion dollar industry within a few years.



	HempTech Corp:



	HempTech Corp has several products available specifically
	geared to helping cultivators of industrial hemp and medical cannabis maximum yields while helping to control costs. CaNNaLyTiX™
	, SPIDer™, SmartSense™ ,Smart.NRG™ , and CaNNaTRAK™.




	CaNNaLyTiX™


	“A picture is
	worth a thousand words” and being able to visualize all the various aspects of a cultivation enterprise solves challenges
	before they become problems. CaNNaLyTiX™ is a dashboard controller system that allows the various computer systems to be
	integrated throughout a cultivator’s infrastructures. Using state-of –the-art API connecting software packages, CaNNaLyTiX™
	can allow all computer systems to be monitored with the ease of a smartphone app and the robust hardware of integrated servers
	or cloud-based application.




	CaNNaTRAK™


	- the next generation
	of barcode & RFID tracking systems for keeping pace with the extensive demands of seed to sale tracking of Hemp/Cannabis for
	state compliance. We are currently developing “game changer” modifications that will make it the ultimate software
	system in the industry. CannaTRAK’s Asset Tracking Management Software automates the major aspects of the Asset Life Cycle.
	The Product suite is made up of modules, which are able to operate independently of one another, are able to be configured to work
	together, or to be integrated with non-native applications. CaNNaTRAK™ software easily tracks assets using bar coding, radio
	frequency (RFID), imaging, and wireless technologies. CaNNaTRAK™ software is designed under the client/server architecture,
	is multi-user and menu-driven following industry-standard MS Windows protocols and graphical user interfaces. CaNNaTRAK™
	applications are compatible with MS Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7 & 8.1 operating systems and with SQL Server 2008 through 2013.


	CaNNaTRAK’s mobile information applications
	are compatible with Windows Mobile devices and are tightly integrated with; bar coding, RFID, GPS, imaging, biometrics and wireless
	technologies. Due to the State law, legal governance, compliance and tax reasons, we believe CaNNaTRAK™ will be an invaluable
	tool for legal compliance and profitability from growers to dispensers of the legal medicinal marijuana. Over the past decade,
	22 (any change since November elections?)states have approved the use of medicinal marijuana. Medicinal marijuana has become an
	alternative to traditional treatments for patients with clinical diseases such as cancer and HIV/AIDS. The medicinal marijuana
	market is estimated to be valued in the billions of dollars initially and may provide hundreds of millions of dollars tax revenue
	for the state’s tax coffers.


	We believe compliance and governance will be a big
	concern for the state offices overseeing the cannabis lifecycle and CaNNaTRAK™ will be an invaluable tool to comply and monitor
	for the medicinal marijuana industry. Our competition presently consists of the MITS system being used in the state of Colorado,
	the BioTrackTHC system being used in the state of Washington, and MJ Freeway. Certainly we will look to enter every burgeoning
	market throughout the United States.




	SPIDer


	(Secure Perimeter Intrusion Detection
	Network) is a system to meet the needs of theft and malicious attacks. While the economy is seeing improvement, theft, site destruction,
	and malicious activity are still happening at an alarming rate and within the legal Cannabis/Hemp industry surging forward we can
	expect no change particularly because of its specific draw. The SPIDer systems consist of 3 levels of detection to identify intruders
	and threats in areas that are restricted.


	The first level utilizes an electronically charged
	coaxial cable woven into your chain link fencing. Excessive fence movement will set off an alarm through your network notification
	system that someone is attempting to enter your facility. This is a very cost effective means to secure your site to meet security
	requirements for your company. The second level consists of a visual intrusion monitoring system. It is a wireless, battery operated,
	and connected through the cellular network. It provides 24/7 monitoring and notification through the internet and email system.
	Once an intruder is identified an alarm is sent to the security team with a picture that allows you to identify if this is an authorized
	or unauthorized person.


	The network system can quickly be deployed and moved
	to provide security coverage as needed. The third level is a multi-level detection and verification system that uses both level
	one and level two to rapidly identify a potential intruder and provide you information for a rapid decision. The combination of
	the two systems provides the additional barriers for quick action. Sometimes seconds are critical in preventing serious damage
	or theft at your site. The command center software provides intrusion notification to your network center and to individuals via
	email. For level two and three you receive a picture that enables you to make a more informed and quicker decision concerning your
	action.






	 









	 






	The SPIDer solution addresses the potential threat
	facing the entire Cannabis/Hemp industry. With this system you are able to supply your security team with information that enables
	them to be proactive in addressing these costly activities. Compliance with state rules and regulations for the Cannabis/ Hemp
	industry is going to be essential. Though there are many security companies on the market, few are adapting themselves to the Cannabis
	industry.




	SmartSense


	- offers wireless security
	and smart sensor mesh network for precision agriculture, irrigation systems, and greenhouses for the hemp industry. Our Smart Agriculture
	models allow monitoring multiple environmental parameters involving a wide range of applications with smart sensors such as Leaf
	Wetness, Atmospheric Pressure, Solar Radiation, Air Temperature / Humidity, Soil Temperature / Moisture, Ultraviolet Radiation
	etc. The smart sensor information will be collected and sent via the cloud to the central office for analysis and procedural modifications.
	FutureWorld is not aware of any another competitor in the United States. FutureWorld, through HempTech plans on marketing the product
	to large and medium sized grow facilities since they will have the greatest need.




	SmartNergy


	- offers tools to analyze
	every aspect of a cultivator’s energy usage. Being fully integrated with CaNNaLyTiX™, one can visualize energy consumption
	in real-time and track historical usage. The software’s predictive functionality also helps optimize energy use challenges
	proactively. We believe a cultivator’s huge electric bills can be scaled back when the entire grow is looked at as a complete
	and fully integrated operation.




	CaNNaBoX™


	- Much like a bank ATM,
	the CaNNaBoX™ machine operates with the swipe of a card, which will verify identity, age and prescription information of
	a medical marijuana patient before releasing measured packages of marijuana. The advantage is you will not have to be waited on
	by an assistant if you don't require consultation and the store location is busy. The machine is capable of holding several hundred
	items in multiple forms of marijuana. CaNNaBoX™ is a secure robotic device specifically designed for dispensing cannabis
	products in secure prepackaged amounts, in complete accordance with state law requirements, in licensed dispensaries, and only
	to legal buyers.


	FutureWorld has teamed up with American Green to brand
	the Zazzz Dispensary machine with the CaNNaBoX™ logo and distribute the product across the United States and possibly worldwide.
	Presently the Zazzz machine presented by American Green, which is first to the market, MedBox Inc.’s machine, and a vending
	machine product by Endexx Corp also distribute the product. The model for FutureWorld is to bring 1500 units to market within a
	couple years in accordance with our JV goals alongside American Green and its Zazzz machine.


	There will be a revenue sharing agreement with American
	Green and FutureWorld for every placed CaNNaBoX™ machine via monthly leasing and transaction costs. We are currently putting
	together the details of the JV with American Green and beginning the marketing and design phase of our product. Revenues are purely
	a function of quantity at this point. A monthly leasing fee of approximately $150 dollars a month and a transaction cost somewhere
	between $1.50 and $2.00 per. Competing brands are to look for a large upfront expenditures from dispensaries for the machines which
	we believe will make their sales model harder to actual achieve sales nationwide.


	CaNNaBoX™ will be marketed exclusively through
	our new dispensary division, DispenseTek. DispenseTek was created to market and sell dispensary related products and services including
	but not limited to CaNNaBoX™. It is important to understand, CaNNaBoX™ robotic dispensaries are secure delivery and
	control systems for use in licensed cannabis dispensaries and not “vending machines”. Their specific design benefits
	public safety, governance, dispensaries, and consumers.


	HempTech has also signed an agreement with Colorado
	Flower Company to provide turnkey state-of-the-art technology for their grow facility which is being built on our land in Colorado.
	The contract calls for $1.5M and the technology is leased at $190K per month for five years.



	FutureLand Properties, LLC.



	On October 06, 2014, the Company has formed a 100%
	owned subsidiary: Futureland Properties, LLC in the state of Colorado. FutureLand’ s primary purpose is to purchase properties
	for lease back or lease to Hemp farmers and medical cannabis growers. Futureland Properties purchased a 240 acres of agricultural
	land in the southern Colorado. FutureLand Properties, LLC, closed on 237 acres in southern Colorado on October 30th, 2014 for the
	purpose of leasing to licensed Cannabis and Hemp growers. The decision was made based on increased demand for medical and recreational
	cannabis and loosening of some restrictions in Colorado. We believe the future of cannabis grows will belong to large state-of-the-art
	facilities much like agricultural industry. In Colorado and other legal states, only few large cannabis grow facilities will remain
	which would allow for easier supervision and administration by the State and Federal government.


	On December 5, 2014, the Company announces the completion
	of a Commercial Lease Agreement effective 1st day of December, 2014 by and between FutureLand Properties, LLC, a Colorado corporation
	("Landlord") and Colorado Flower Company, LTD. ("Tenant"). FutureLand is the owner of land and improvements
	commonly known as TWP 27 RNG 68 SEC 25: NE4NW4 LESS 3






	 









	 






	ACRES FOR RIGHT OF WAY TOTAL ACRES 37, La Vita Colorado
	81011 (hereinafter the "Property"). FutureLand will be the owner of a 14,940 square foot greenhouse and any other structures
	to be constructed/situated on the Property. The greenhouse and land may be collectively referred to hereinafter as the "Leased
	Premises.". This Commercial Lease Agreement is for five (5) years and FutureLand shall also grant to the Tenant additional
	three (3) years options to renew this Commercial Lease at Tenant's sole discretion.


	The Company is to finance and build 2000+ plant cannabis
	cultivation greenhouse for Colorado Flower Company on a 37 acres property owned by the Company. This large cultivation facility
	will be one of many on the same property. Company is also to provide high tech automation solutions to control all processes in
	the greenhouses based on HempTech's state-of-the-art technologies.



	The
	Company (through separate agreements with HempTech and CB Scientific) will provide greenhouse, processing equipment, Spider Security
	Technology, SmartSense, SmartNergy, CaNNaLyTiX




	,
	and growing/laboratory equipment located on the Property provided by HempTech Corp and CB Scientific. HempTech Corp., a FutureWorld
	Corp. subsidiary, will supply Spider Security Technology, SmartSense, SmartNergy and CaNNaLyTiX. CB Scientific, a FutureWorld
	Corp. subsidiary, will supply all testing and laboratory equipment to the Grow.



	The master lease agreement calls for $575,000 monthly
	lease payments for the land, the greenhouse and the technology for five years.


	FutureLand Properties only leases the land, infrastructure
	and technologies. It does not grow or sell or distribute any products that are in violation of the United States Controlled Substances
	Act (US.CSA).

	Nature of the Business, and History of the Company and
	its Subsidiaries



	 


	The nature of the business and the history of the Company
	and its subsidiaries are as follows:


	  


	Nature of the Business


	 


	FutureWorld Corp., a Delaware corporation, is a U.S. diversified
	Hemp/Cannabis Company, listed on the Over the Counter exchange, which was originally formed to capitalize on the burgeoning markets
	in renewable and alternative energy technologies, but has since changed direction and moved into the Hemp/Cannabis space. FutureWorld,
	together with its subsidiaries, focuses on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of Hemp/Cannabis
	products, services and technologies globally.


	 


	FutureWorld is seeking to acquire minority or full interest
	in currently operating companies and disruptive technologies in the Industrial Hemp/Medical and Recreational Cannabis Industry
	globally; such as vaporizers, lab testing, tracking systems, security, CBD oil, testing kits, financial solutions, dispensaries
	and other needed components. Our goal is to provide our acquired






	 









	 






	companies, current and future shareholders a clear strategy
	for the growth of their companies and their investment in those companies.


	 



	2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The consolidated financial statements
	include the accounts and operations of FutureWorld Corp., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, URVape, Inc., HempTech Corp., CB Scientific,
	FutureLand Properties, LLC and MedTest Inc.


	 



	Basis of Accounting



	 


	The Company maintains its financial records and financial
	statements on the accrual basis of accounting, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
	of America. The accrual basis of accounting provides for matching of revenues and expenses in the period they were earned and incurred.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers
	all cash accounts that are not subject to withdrawal restrictions or designated for assets acquisitions, and certificates of deposit
	that have an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company believes it is not exposed
	to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 



	The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company
	in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:




	 


	 


	 




	 



	• 





	Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accounts Receivable, Prepaid Expenses, Accounts Payable,  and  Accrued Expenses

	:





	 


	 



	The carrying amount reported in the balance sheets
	for these items approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.


	 





	 



	• 





	Loans and Notes Payable to Related Parties:






	 


	 



	The carrying value of loans and notes payable to related parties approximates fair value as each of the notes payable carries an interest rate commensurate with commercial borrowing rates available to the Company.





	 


	 



	As of December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014, the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments approximate their historical carrying amount.





	 



	Accounts Receivable




	 



	Accounts receivable consist of
	amounts due for the delivery of Product sales to customers. An allowance for doubtful accounts is considered to be established
	for any amounts that may not be recoverable, which is based on an analysis of the Company’s customer credit worthiness, and
	current economic trends. Based on management’s review of accounts receivable, no allowance for doubtful accounts was considered
	necessary as of period end. Receivables are determined to be past due, based on payment terms of original invoices. The Company
	does not typically charge interest on past due receivables. Balances on Current sales are due in 60 days from the date of
	sale.



	Inventory



	 


	Inventory consists of finished product,
	URVape electronic vaporizing cigarettes valued at the lower of cost or market valuation under the first-in, first-out method of
	costing, PersonalAnalytics testing kits that are also valued at the lower of cost or market valuation under the first-in, first-out
	method of costing and CBD bulk oil that are also valued at the lower of cost or market valuation under the first-in, first-out
	method of costing.


	 



	Property and Equipment



	 


	Property and equipment are recorded at historical cost.  Depreciation
	is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the respective assets, ranging from three to seven years.  The
	carrying amount of all long-lived assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation periods or the
	unamortized balance is warranted.  Based upon the Company's most recent analysis, management believes that no impairment
	of property and equipment exists at December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014.


	 






	 









	 







	Intangible assets



	 


	Intangible assets are recorded at cost
	and amortized over their useful lives. The Company's goodwill associated with its acquisitions is not amortized. Management reviews
	goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis and at other times when existing conditions raise substantial questions about
	their recoverability.


	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 



	Periodically,
	the Company assesses the recoverability of the Company’s intangible assets, consisting of the


	Intellectual
	Property & licensing for CaNNaTRAK, SmartSense, CaNNaLyTiX


	and its trademark,
	and record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying amounts of the assets exceed its fair value.  Based upon
	management's most recent analysis, the Company believes that no impairment of the Company’s tangible or intangible assets
	exist at December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014.





	 





	Revenue Recognition



	 



	The
	Company is principally in the business of providing solutions to the cannabis industry that incorporates our


	CaNNaTRAK,
	SmartSense, URVape, PersonalAnalytics and CaNNaLyTiX


	technologies. Contracts
	include multiple revenue components, comprised of our product sale, software licensing, hardware platforms, installation, training
	and maintenance.  In accordance with ASC 605-25 Multiple-Element Arrangements, revenue from licensing the software will
	be recognized upon installation and acceptance of the software by customers. Revenue from sale of products (URVape & PersonalAnalytics)
	will be recognized upon the delivery of the product to our customer. When a software sales arrangement includes rights to
	customer support, the portion of the license fee allocated to such support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement,
	normally one year.  Revenue from professional services arrangements will be recognized in the month in which services
	are rendered over the term of the arrangement.




	Revenue associated with software sales to distributors is recognized, net of discounts, when the Company has performed substantially
	all its obligations under the arrangement.  Until such time as substantially all obligations under the arrangement are
	met, software sales are recognized as deferred revenue.  Costs and expenses associated with deferred revenue are also
	deferred.  When a software sales arrangements include a commitment to provide training and/or other services or materials,
	the Company estimates and records the expected costs of these training and/or other services and/or materials.


	 



	Foreign currency translation



	 


	The Company’s functional currency
	and its reporting currency is the United States Dollar.


	 



	Cost of Goods Sold




	 



	The Company recognizes the direct cost
	of purchasing product for sale, including freight-in and packaging, as cost of goods sold in the accompanying income statement.


	 



	Stock Based Compensation



	 


	The Companies estimate the fair value of share-based payment
	awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. For stock-based awards issued to employees
	and directors, stock-based compensation is attributed to expense using the straight-line single option method, which is consistent
	with how the prior-period pro-forma were provided. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Statements of Operations
	for the three and nine months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 included compensation expense for share-based payment awards granted
	prior to, but not yet vested based on the grant date fair value estimated and compensation expense for the share-based payment
	awards granted subsequent to January 1, 2013 based on the grant date fair value estimated.


	 


	The Company’s determination of fair value of share-based
	payment awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model, which is affected by the Company’s
	stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but
	are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option
	exercise behaviors.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company records federal and state income tax liability
	at the federal and state rates after allowances. Deferred income taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax
	assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards, and deferred tax liabilities
	are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and their tax bases.






	 









	 






	 


	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance
	when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	Tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized
	in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions
	of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. Income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not
	recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized and in subsequent periods.


	 


	The Company adopted a policy under which, if required to
	be recognized in the future, they will classify interest related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of interest
	expense and will classify any related penalties in selling, engineering, general and administrating expenses in the statement of
	operations.


	 



	Advertising Costs



	 


	Advertising costs are charged to operations as incurred.


	 



	Earnings (Loss) Per Share



	 


	Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings (loss) available
	to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted EPS is
	similarly calculated, except that the denominator includes common shares that may be issued subject to existing rights with dilutive
	potential, except when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.


	 


	Based on an estimated current value of the Company’s
	stock being equal to or less than the exercise price of the warrants, none of the shares assumed issued upon conversion of the
	warrants, nor any of the stock assumed issued under the Company's Incentive Stock Plan are included in the computation of fully
	diluted loss per share, since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.


	 



	Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation
	of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment. ASU No. 2014-08 defines a discontinued operation as disposal of components
	of an entity that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations. ASU No. 201408
	also requires a reporting entity to present the assets and liabilities of a disposal group that includes a discontinued operation
	separately in the asset and liability sections, respectively, of the statement of financial position for each comparative period.
	ASU 2014-08 becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Adoption of ASU 2014-08 is
	not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Presentation
	of Financial Statements-Going Concern. This statement provides US GAAP guidance on management’s responsibility in evaluation
	whether there is substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures.
	For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial
	doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are
	issued. The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter.


	 


	In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16-Derivatives
	and Hedging: Determining Whether the Host contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin
	to Debt or to Equity. Certain classes of shares include features that entitle the holders to preferences and rights (such as conversion
	rights, redemption rights, voting powers and liquidation and dividend payment preferences) over the other shareholders. Shares
	that include embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments, which must be separated from the host
	contract and accounted for as a derivative if certain criteria are met. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
	within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015


	 


	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB,
	the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed
	by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.


	 



	3.  Going Concern



	 






	 









	 






	For the quarter ended December 31, 2014, the Company incurred
	a net loss of $167,996 and a cumulative net loss since inception of $6,680,324.  As of December 31, 2014, the Company had
	cash of $150,794 and working capital deficit of $1,099,308 with which to satisfy any future cash requirements.  These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company depends upon
	capital derived from future financing activities such as loans from its officers and directors, subsequent offerings of its common
	stock or debt financing in order to operate and grow the business either directly or through its subsidiary.  There can
	be no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising such capital.  The key factors that are not in the Company's
	control and that may have a direct bearing on operating results.  These factors include, but are not limited to, acceptance
	of the Company’s business plan, the ability to raise capital in the future, the ability to expand its customer base, and
	the ability to hire key employees to grow the business.  There may be other risks and circumstances that management may
	be unable to predict.

	useful lives of the Product Technology and Trademarks have been evaluated to have a useful life of 15 years and are being amortized
	accordingly per the financial statements. For the three and nine months ended December 31, 2014, the amortization expense for intangible
	assets was $6,726 and $9,531, respectively.

	Item 2.   Management’s discussion
	and analysis of financial condition and results of operations



	 


	You should read the following discussion and analysis in
	conjunction with the information set forth under Item 6, Selected Consolidated Financial Data, and our consolidated financial statements
	and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding our expectations
	of our future performance, liquidity and capital resources, and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking
	statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the
	risks and uncertainties described under "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results
	may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Our significant accounting policies
	are more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements. However, certain accounting policies are particularly important
	to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our
	management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses
	their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are
	based on knowledge of our industry, historical operations, terms of existing contracts, and our observance of trends in the industry,
	information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.

	Key Elements of Operating and Financial Performance



	 


	We monitor the key elements of our operating and financial
	performance to help us evaluate growth trends, determine investment priorities, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness of
	our sales efforts and assess operational efficiencies.


	 



	Revenue



	 


	Currently, we derived all of our revenue from sales of URVape
	vaporizer pens, PersonalAnalytics test kits, FutureLand land lease agreement and selling our CBD oil under “CBDESSENCE”.
	In 2014, lease and product revenue represented 100% of our total revenue.


	 


	We expect to diversify our revenue base by licensing and
	selling HempTech related products and services by the end of 2014 and beyond.


	 



	Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (Loss)



	 


	Product cost of revenue consists of third party product costs,
	including raw materials, component parts and associated freight, and normal yield loss in the period in which we recognize the
	related revenue. In addition, product cost of revenue may include compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation provided
	to our personnel, and overhead and other direct costs, which are recognized in the period in which we recognize the related revenue.
	Further, we recognize certain costs, including logistics costs, expenses for inventory obsolescence, warranty obligations, lower
	of cost or market adjustments to inventory, and amortization of intangibles, in the period in which they are incurred or can be
	reasonably estimated.


	 


	Service cost of revenue includes compensation and related
	costs for our yearly maintenance service delivery, customer operations and customer support personnel, facilities and infrastructure
	cost and depreciation. In accordance with our accounting policies, we recognize service cost of revenue in the period in which
	it is incurred even though the associated service revenue may be required to be deferred as described under "-Critical Accounting
	Policies and Estimates-Revenue Recognition."


	 


	Our gross profit (loss) varies from period to period based
	on the volume, average selling prices, and mix of products and services recognized as revenue, as well as product and service costs,
	expense for warranty obligations, and inventory write-downs. The timing of revenue recognition and related costs, which depends
	primarily on customer acceptance, can fluctuate significantly from period to period and have a material impact on our gross profit
	and gross margin results.


	 



	Operating Expenses







	 









	 






	 


	Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales
	and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, as well as legal settlement expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles.
	Personnel-related expense represents a significant component of our operating expenses.


	 



	Sales and Marketing



	 


	Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of; compensation,
	benefits, sales commissions and stock-based compensation provided to our sales, marketing and business development personnel, as
	well as facility costs and other related overhead; marketing programs, including expenses associated with industry events and trade
	shows; and travel costs.


	 



	General and Administrative



	 


	General and administrative expense consists primarily of;
	compensation, benefits and stock-based compensation provided to our executive, finance, legal, human resource and administrative
	personnel, as well as facility costs and other related overhead; and


	fees paid for professional services, including legal, tax
	and accounting services.


	 



	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 




	Revenues



	 


	Total revenue for three months ended December 31, 2014 and
	2013 was $362,416 and $0.00, respectively, representing an increase of 100%. Substantially all revenue from 2014 was derived from
	few customers. The increase in total revenue is attributable to our successful ongoing product development efforts and inventions
	such as URVape and PersonalAnalytics test kits. We expect to substantially increase our total revenue by marketing HempTech related
	products and services for the next several quarters.


	 


	Total revenue for nine months ended December 31, 2014 and
	2013 was $440,188 and $0.00, respectively, representing an increase of 100%. Substantially all revenue from 2014 was derived from
	few customers. The increase in total revenue is attributable to our successful ongoing product development efforts and inventions
	such as URVape, PersonalAnalytics test kits and our land lease. We expect to substantially increase our total revenue by marketing
	HempTech related products and services for the next several quarters.


	 



	Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

	.


	 


	Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three
	months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $367,453 and $40,312 respectively. The increase in selling, general
	and administrative expenses in 2014 as compared 2013 was due primarily to the cost of additional human resources, higher professional
	fees related to fees associated with additional debt financings. General and administrative expenses increased due to additional
	expenses incurred as the result of the Company’s start of operating activities.


	 


	Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine
	months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were approximately $885,818 and $147,502, respectively. The increase in selling, general
	and administrative expenses in 2014 as compared 2013 was due primarily to the cost of additional human resources, higher professional
	fees related to fees associated with additional debt financings. General and administrative expenses increased due to additional
	expenses incurred as the result of the Company’s start of operating activities.


	 


	Net Loss from Operations. For the quarter ended December
	31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred net losses of $167,996 and $52,730, respectively. Losses also include depreciation and amortization,
	non-cash expenses, in the amount of $112,304 and $9,870 for the quarter ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There were
	no write downs in 2014: however, impairments and write downs of certain assets occurred in 2014 and 2013, due to valuation assessments
	by management, incurring charges of approximately $25,338 and $31,538 respectively.


	 


	Net Loss from Operations. For the nine months ended December
	31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred net losses of $816,542 and $208,677, respectively. Losses also include depreciation and amortization,
	non-cash expenses, in the amount of $115,109 and $42,810, respectively. There were no write downs in 2014: however, impairments
	and write downs of certain assets occurred in 2014 and 2013, due to valuation assessments by management, incurring charges of approximately
	$25,338 and $31,538 respectively


	 


	Compensation and consulting expenses were $124,296 and $39,132
	for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively, Compensation and consulting expenses were $354,578 and $146,055
	for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 respectively. The increases are due to the increase in operations and officer
	compensation.


	 



	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 






	 









	 






	We had $150,794 in cash at December 31, 2014, and $60,047
	respectively remaining on the lines of credit from Mr. Talari with which to satisfy our future cash requirements. Our management
	believes that the credit lines will support only limited activities for the next twelve months. The Company depends upon capital
	derived from future financing activities such as loans from its officers and directors, subsequent offerings of its common stock
	or debt financing in order to operate and grow the business either directly or through its subsidiary. There can be no assurance
	that the Company will be successful in raising such capital. The key factors that are not in the Company's control and that may
	have a direct bearing on operating results. These factors include, but are not limited to, acceptance of the Company’s business
	plan, the ability to raise capital in the future, the ability to expand its customer base, and the ability to hire key employees
	to grow the business. There may be other risks and circumstances that management may be unable to predict. We had no other contractual
	obligation or material commercial commitments for capital expenditures.


	 



	Our critical accounting policies include:



	 


	Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue from licensing
	our software upon the installation and acceptance of the software by customers in accordance with Statement of Position 97-2, Software
	Revenue Recognition. When a software sales arrangement includes rights to customer support, the portion of the license fee allocated
	to such support is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement, normally one year. Revenue from professional services arrangements
	will be recognized in the month in which services are rendered over the term of the arrangement. We also recognize revenue from
	selling URVape vape pens and our THC and CBD testing kits calls, PersonalAnalytics when purchase orders received.


	 


	Long-Lived Assets - We depreciate property and equipment
	and amortize intangible assets, including software development costs over the respective assets’ estimated useful life and
	periodically review the remaining useful lives of our assets to ascertain that our estimate is still valid. If we determine a useful
	life has materially changed, we either change the useful life or write the asset down or if we determine the asset has exhausted
	its useful life, we write the asset off completely.


	 


	Stock Based Compensation - We account for stock based compensation
	under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, (revised 2004) Share-Based Payments. Under the fair
	value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, we recognize stock-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and
	therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award. Calculating
	stock-based compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option grant,
	stock price volatility, and the pre-vesting option forfeiture rate. We estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical
	exercise patterns. We estimate stock price volatility based on historical implied volatility in our stock. In addition, we are
	required to estimate the expected volatility rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the
	forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted, exercised or cancelled.


	 


	Income Taxes - We record federal and state income tax liability
	in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 – Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred income taxes
	are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
	loss and tax credit carry forwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences
	are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced
	by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
	not be realized.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No
	new standards had any material effect on these financial statements. The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date
	of these financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these consolidated
	financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these consolidated
	financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these consolidated financial statements
	because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to December 31, 2014 through the date
	these financial statements were issued.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not participate in transactions that generate relationships
	with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities, which have
	been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes.


	 



	Management Consideration of Alternative Business Strategies



	 


	In order to continue to protect and increase shareholder
	value management believes that it may, from time to time, consider alternative






	 









	 






	management strategies to create value for the company or
	additional revenues. Strategies to be reviewed may include acquisitions; roll-ups; strategic alliances; joint ventures on large
	projects; and/or mergers.


	 


	The Company is currently in the final stages of selling all
	the assets of HempTech Corp to a publicly traded company. Management believes that acquisitions will be a catalyst for advancing
	the Company's existing technology and products to attain greater market share. Additionally, we are seeking capital financing for
	the purposes of furthering our plan of operations.







	Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk



	 


	We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2
	of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.



	 





	Item 4.  Controls and Procedures



	 


	As of December 31, 2014 we carried out an evaluation of the
	effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. This
	evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rule
	13a-15e), our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2014 such disclosure controls
	and procedures were not effective.


	 





	·




	We do not have adequate personnel and other resources to assure that significant and complex transactions are timely analyzed and reviewed.






	·




	We have limited personnel and financial resources available to plan, develop, and implement disclosure and procedure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.






	·




	Our limited financial resources restrict our employment adequate personnel needed and desirable to separate the various receiving, recording, reviewing and oversight functions for the exercise effective control over financial reporting.






	·




	Our limited resources restrict our ability to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.





	 



	Our management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company. Internal control over financial
	reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes
	in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting
	includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; provide reasonable
	assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and provide reasonable
	assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial
	statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
	Pursuant to Rule 13a-15d of the Exchange Act, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
	financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992) and Internal Control Over Financial
	Reporting Guidance for Smaller Public Companies (2006), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
	Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December
	31, 2014.


	 



	 


	This quarterly report does not include an attestation report
	of the company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
	report was not subject to attestation by the company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the company to provide only management’s report in this quarterly report.


	 



	Changes in Controls and Procedures



	 


	There were no significant changes made in our internal controls
	over financial reporting during the first quarter December 31, 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
	affect these controls. Thus, no corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses were necessary.


	 






	 









	 







	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Control



	 


	Our management, including the President, does not expect
	that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud
	and material errors. An internal control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
	there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
	limitations on all internal control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and
	instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
	can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
	the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, and/or by management override of the control. The design
	of any system of internal control is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there
	can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time,
	controls may become inadequate because of changes in circumstances, and/or the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
