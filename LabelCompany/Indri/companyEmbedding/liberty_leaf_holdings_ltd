Vancouver, BC - July 13, 2017: Liberty Leaf Holdings Ltd. (CSE: LIB, OTCQB: LIBFF and FSE: HN3P) (the 'Company' or 'Liberty Leaf') announced today that North Road Ventures, acquired by Liberty Leaf on October 19, 2016, is adding cannabis oil to its proposed product line.
      

        North Road Ventures (an Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) applicant) focuses on distributing high-quality medicinal cannabis. The company is expanding into the recreational market to coincide with the anticipated legalization in 2018.
      

        As disclosed July 6, 2017, Liberty Leaf has contracted Cannabis Compliance Inc. to submit an abridgment to its current application with Health Canada. The abridgment will increase the authorized distribution capacity of the company as well as add new products to its application.
      

        In its latest ACMPR Market Data update (December 2016), Health Canada data shows that sales of cannabis oil increased 156% over the previous quarter. Sales reports from Colorado show that cannabis oil and associated products produce more than 50% of cannabis revenues. This trend is due to the fact that many patients and users want the benefits of cannabis but do not want to smoke the product. Cannabis oil can be consumed inconspicuously by taking orally or vaping.
      

An Opportunity for Remarkable Rewards


        During the period that Health Canada has collected and released data regarding the sale of cannabis oil, the number of kilograms sold has been growing at a much faster rate, compared to that of dried marijuana sold over that time.
      

        'The addition of cannabis oil is a strategic decision,' said Will Rascan, President and CEO of Liberty Leaf. 'North Road waited for the optimum time to proceed with an abridgement to its Health Canada application, to ensure that its sense for the cannabis oil market was validated. The opportunity for remarkable returns in getting into the cannabis oil market at this time is exceptional.'
      

        The company plans to include at least three different proprietary cannabis oil formulations with differing proportions of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiols (CBDs) in each one. Consumers have different needs, some desiring a high THC content and others only requiring CBDs. The company's product stock-keeping units (SKUs) will vary with consumer preferences and demands, although it is currently expected that cannabis oil with both THC and CBDs will be the market leader.
      

        Cannabis delivery mechanisms are continually changing, and the company will adapt its packaging and concentration levels to match consumer preferences in this expanded product line.
      

        According to Rascan: 'The rewards of such a course of action are likely to be substantial. While the potential for applications in the medical market is obvious, the growth curve in the recreational sector will result in an exponential increase in consumption.'
      

About Liberty Leaf


        Liberty Leaf Holdings Ltd. is a new Canadian-based, public company whose focus is to build and support a diversified portfolio of cannabis sector businesses, including cultivation, value added CBD/THC products, biotech research, and supply chain products within this dynamic and fast growing sector.
      

        Liberty Leaf also owns 100% of North Road Ventures, a late-stage applicant under Health Canada's Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR). For further info on the Company please visit http://www.libleaf.com  or email will@libleaf.com

07/13/2017 | News release | Distributed by Public on 07/13/2017 10:53
Liberty Leaf Adds Cannabis Oil to its Proposed Product Line








Vancouver, BC - July 13, 2017: Liberty Leaf Holdings Ltd. (CSE: LIB, OTCQB: LIBFF and FSE: HN3P) (the 'Company' or 'Liberty Leaf') announced today that North Road Ventures, acquired by Liberty Leaf on October 19, 2016, is adding cannabis oil to its proposed product line.
      

        North Road Ventures (an Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) applicant) focuses on distributing high-quality medicinal cannabis. The company is expanding into the recreational market to coincide with the anticipated legalization in 2018.
      

        As disclosed July 6, 2017, Liberty Leaf has contracted Cannabis Compliance Inc. to submit an abridgment to its current application with Health Canada. The abridgment will increase the authorized distribution capacity of the company as well as add new products to its application.
      

        In its latest ACMPR Market Data update (December 2016), Health Canada data shows that sales of cannabis oil increased 156% over the previous quarter. Sales reports from Colorado show that cannabis oil and associated products produce more than 50% of cannabis revenues. This trend is due to the fact that many patients and users want the benefits of cannabis but do not want to smoke the product. Cannabis oil can be consumed inconspicuously by taking orally or vaping.
      

An Opportunity for Remarkable Rewards


        During the period that Health Canada has collected and released data regarding the sale of cannabis oil, the number of kilograms sold has been growing at a much faster rate, compared to that of dried marijuana sold over that time.
      

        'The addition of cannabis oil is a strategic decision,' said Will Rascan, President and CEO of Liberty Leaf. 'North Road waited for the optimum time to proceed with an abridgement to its Health Canada application, to ensure that its sense for the cannabis oil market was validated. The opportunity for remarkable returns in getting into the cannabis oil market at this time is exceptional.'
      

        The company plans to include at least three different proprietary cannabis oil formulations with differing proportions of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to cannabidiols (CBDs) in each one. Consumers have different needs, some desiring a high THC content and others only requiring CBDs. The company's product stock-keeping units (SKUs) will vary with consumer preferences and demands, although it is currently expected that cannabis oil with both THC and CBDs will be the market leader.
      

        Cannabis delivery mechanisms are continually changing, and the company will adapt its packaging and concentration levels to match consumer preferences in this expanded product line.
      

        According to Rascan: 'The rewards of such a course of action are likely to be substantial. While the potential for applications in the medical market is obvious, the growth curve in the recreational sector will result in an exponential increase in consumption.'
      

About Liberty Leaf


        Liberty Leaf Holdings Ltd. is a new Canadian-based, public company whose focus is to build and support a diversified portfolio of cannabis sector businesses, including cultivation, value added CBD/THC products, biotech research, and supply chain products within this dynamic and fast growing sector.
      

        Liberty Leaf also owns 100% of North Road Ventures, a late-stage applicant under Health Canada's Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR). For further info on the Company please visit http://www.libleaf.com  or email [email protected]

North Road Ventures Applies to Upgrade its Vault for a Capacity Increase to Over $31 Million








North Road Ventures - A Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Liberty Leaf - Applies to Upgrade its Vault for a Capacity Increase to Over $31 Million


North Road Ventures Establishing Itself as an Independent Distributor


Vancouver, BC - July 20, 2017: North Road Ventures, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Leaf Holdings Ltd. (CSE: LIB, OTCQB: LIBFF and FSE: HN3P) (the 'Company' or 'Liberty Leaf'), has included in its application abridgment to Health Canada to dramatically increase the storage capacity of its vault.
      

        In North Road's application to have its vault capacity upgraded, the company will request approval for a Level 8 vault capacity, which would house $6.25 million in bulk cannabis product. The modular vault specified by North Road can be easily and inexpensively upgraded to a Level 9 version, enabling North Road to achieve inventory capacity of up to $31.25 million of cannabis products.
      

        North Road Ventures' intention is to establish itself as an independent third-party distributor of cultivated and manufactured cannabis products to licenced, legal retailers.  Initially targeting the British Columbia market place, North Road envisions expanding nationally, and internationally as the evolution of the global legal cannabis industry continues at a rapid transformational pace.
      

        Acquired by Liberty Leaf on October 19, 2016, North Road Ventures, an Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) applicant, focuses on distributing high-quality medical cannabis. The company is expanding into the recreational market to coincide with the anticipated legalization in 2018.
      

        'It's important to note that the revenues under these conditions are determined by the number of inventory 'turns' that occur in the vault' According to Liberty Leaf President & CEO, Will Rascan. 'If one assumes the reasonable scenario that the vault is replenished once a quarter, the resulting revenue generated from a Level 9 vault is significant.'
