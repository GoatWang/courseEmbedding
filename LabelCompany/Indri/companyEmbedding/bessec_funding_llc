What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?

They coordinated the critical conversations and infrastructure across many of our business lines and support units. Their execution was flawless. It is clear that CD Funding Group has the requisite experience and expertise to help financial institutions of all sizes to promote this significant product offering."
CURTIS J. FUSZARD, CFA, CFP®, CLTC
	PRESIDENT AND CEO
	ASSOCIATED BANK INVESTMENT SERVICES, INC.
	CLIENT SINCE 07/2011




Superior Bank Support
"Like any new program implementation, when we first started the Power CD program with CD Funding, I was a bit concerned that it would absorb a significant amount of my time each month – time I felt I really didn’t have.  In all actuality, and quite the contrary, the program represents less than 5% of my total job function.  CD Funding makes our Market-Linked CD program simple.  From an administrative standpoint, there are no knowledge prerequisites.  CD Funding notifies us of all upcoming events, prepares every report and provides all contact information we need.  CD Funding’s expertise is unmatched in the industry, and we are extremely pleased with our partnership."
DONNA R. GREER
	BUSINESS SUPPORT MANAGER
	BANK OF OKLAHOMA
	CLIENT SINCE 12/2006




Best In Class Service
"CD Funding is much more than just building and distributing our monthly proprietary offering.  CD Funding provides “best in class” training, knowledge, and service to our team, and their dedication is second to no one in our industry.  Our advisors and program have benefited greatly from the partnership with CD Funding.  Thanks to the ongoing efforts of CD Funding, I take comfort in knowing our advisors are well educated and trained to position and recommend Market-Linked CDs with current clients and prospects."
VANCE RICHARD
	PROGRAM MANAGER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT
	IBERIA BANK FINANCIAL SERVICES, LLC
	CLIENT SINCE 06/2010




Ease of implementation
"CD Funding helped us move from concept through approval to launch in record time.  I heard at a conference recently that it has taken some banks as much as 18 months to two years to implement a proprietary CD program.  With the help of CD Funding, we were offering an equity-linked CD in the Banco Popular name just two weeks after executing an agreement with them.  CD Funding’s strong, knowledgeable team, led by Tim Bonacci, provided the guidance and strategic support to make the implementation process smooth and seamless.   Their initial rep training and ongoing field support are both critical to the success of our program."

This type of loan is often used for house flippers (fix and flip), developers, renovators, and speculators whose goal is to renovate or develop a property to sell or refinance. Unlike traditional banks and inexperienced lenders, we have the ability to underwrite, evaluate, and fund loans faster and more efficiently with our common sense approach.Learn MoreUltra Short Transactional FundingSame day and up to 90 day fundsTransactional Funding is a two step process for deals that require an intermediary between an original buyer and end buyer, a situation that may occur with many lenders. Typically, most lenders will not allow contract assignments and instead require the original buyer to provide funds immediately upon purchase, regardless of when they anticipate transferring it to the end buyer in a secondary sale. These initial funds can be borrowed for anywhere between 0 and 90 days in order to satisfy the requirements of the bank for the initial purchase before the funds from the end buyer are attained. All standard underwriting procedures are still followed.Learn MoreJoint VenturesCall us to discuss your next dealYork Funding gets creative with joint venture real estate projects with select borrowers.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?
For more information on why Fast Capital 360 is the best choice for shaping your business into what you know it can be, call us today at 800-735-6107 or contact us online.

What Local Florida Realtors are saying about R P Funding:

"We have been blown away with the attention to detail and the efficiency that RP funding has provided our clients. Most of the time it is like pulling teeth with folks in the mortgage industry. RP has simplified everything letting me as a realtor and my clients breathe a little bit easier. I will recommend all of my clients to use RP Funding, hands down." 

Lee Goldberg
		Realtor
		GCI Realty, Inc
		Orlando, Florida

"During the government's &dollar;8,000 home buying credit program, I was the listing agent for a single family home in the BVL area; the buyer had been diligently trying to secure his loan, but 10 days before the closing a last minute over-site by his chosen lender made him ineligible for their loan product and the buyer's agent had no back-up. I suggested to the buyer's agent that the buyer contact RP Funding to review the buyer's qualifications, before they just walked away. RP Funding came through; saving the sale by qualifying the buyer, saving his $8,000 credit and closing the deal on time. Result: all parties to the transaction (buyer, seller and agents) were very happy.
		
Thanks RP!!!"
		
Daniel J. Lopez
		Sales Agent
		Hometown Realty Group, Inc

"I discovered RP Funding through an email advertisement I received.	After looking at their website
		and speaking with Brandon Fields about their low closing costs, 10 day closings, and $1,000
		guarantee, I was anxious to give RP Funding a try.	I sent Brandon a client on Dec. 8th to get pre-
		approved and had a FULL loan approval by Dec. 17th.	Amazing!	Brandon Fields and his
		processor Jill Hoyle are fabulous to work with and they have definitely earned my business.
		RP Funding is the only place I will send my clients from now on!!"

Direct Mortgage Lender - Not a Bank and Not a Broker

The big banks are so backed up with refinances, many raised their rates to slow down volume. 
To a big bank you are just a number, and will most likely work with an out of state call center. 
Mortgage broker fees raise the cost of your refinance, as a Direct Lender you pay no Broker Fees.
We have the authority to underwrite and close your loan, and we do it in as little as 10 days right here in Orlando, Florida. †
Mortgage Rates in Florida will not stay this low for long, and with our fast process you can get in before it's too late.




No Games, No Pushy Sales People and BBB A-Rated
Most mortgage loan officers are paid commission and make extra money by selling you a higher interest
	rate, not here. We don't have pushy commission sales people, you will work directly with a Salaried Credit
	Manager who's only concern is earning your business, not making their next big commission check.
	This helps us keep our rates and fees low.
Based Locally in the Central FL area
Our office is just off of Interstate 4, Exit 90B in Maitland, Florida, just outside of Orlando. We would
	love to meet you in person, although you are welcome to complete the entire process over the phone,
	it's completely up to you.  We help home buyers and home owners all over Florida.
&dollar;1,000 "Best Florida Mortgage Rates" Guarantee
If you find a better loan somewhere else (which we doubt you can) and we can't beat it, we will give
	you a &dollar;1,000 Visa Gift Card.*

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
