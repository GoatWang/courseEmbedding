Method for increasing the antibiotic-producing ability of antibiotic-producing microorganisms



Patent number:  5672497
                                            

Abstract:  A method for increasing the antibiotic-producing ability of an antibiotic-producing microbial host cell is disclosed. The method involves transforming an antibiotic-producing microorganism with a recombinant DNA cloning vector that codes for the expression of an antibiotic biosynthetic enzyme or other gene product. The gene preferably codes for a product that is rate-limiting in the antibiotic biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces. Plasmids that are useful for increasing tylosin production in accordance with the present method include plasmids pHJL280, pHJL284, pHJL309, pHJL311, and pHJL315. The invention further comprises microorganisms transformed with plasmids pHJL280, pHJL284, pHJL309, pHJL311, and pHJL315 and also other microorganisms and vectors used in accordance with the present method.

Bacteriophage Lambda pL promoters



Patent number:  5576190

Ultrahigh copy number streptomycetes plasmids



Patent number:  4898828
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention discloses an .about.1.4 kb Bc1I-Sau3A restriction fragment containing the minimal replicon of the Streptomyces coelicolor plasmid SCP2*. This minimal replicon was deduced from plasmid derivatives constructed by in vitro deletions and has been identified as the smallest, self-replicating segment of the SCP2* plasmid. The minimal replicon specifies an ultrahigh level of plasmid DNA (more than 1000 fold increase from the basic replicon) when vectors containing this sequence are transformed into Streptomyces lividans. This replicon can be used to construct smaller, more efficient recombinant DNA shuttle vectors to clone DNA into streptomycetes.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Method of cloning modified streptomycetes DNA



Patent number:  4710466
                                            

Abstract:  A method of cloning endogenously modified Streptomycetes DNA, which is normally rejected by restrictionless heterospecific hosts, is disclosed. The method uses bacteriophage lambda to construct a genomic library of modified Streptomycetes DNA; such lambda-containing Streptomycetes DNA is replicated to provide a source of non-modified Streptomycetes DNA. This non-modified DNA is subcloned into a selectable cloning vector and used to transform restrictionless hetero-specific hosts. The transformants can then be screened for clones containing genes of interest.

Method for stabilizing and selecting recombinant DNA containing host cell



Patent number:  4650761
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention is an improvement in the method for stabilizing and selecting host cells containing recombinant DNA. The method involves transforming a host cell with a recombinant DNA cloning vector which contains the .about.2.5 kb BglII cI repressor gene-containing restriction fragment of bacteriophage .lambda. and then lysogenizing the transformed host cell with a lysogenic organism which contains a marker which is lethal or conditionally lethal in the host cell but which is repressed in the transformed host cell by the repressor gene contained in the recombinant DNA cloning vector. The vector additionally contains a gene which codes for the expression of human proinsulin. The invention further comprises related recombinant DNA cloning vectors, transformed host cells and lysogenized transformed host cells.
