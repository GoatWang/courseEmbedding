“Excellent facilities, room and service”


Reviewed March 21, 2012




It's no wonder that this place is rated number one and, similar to previous reviews, Jeff went out of his way to email us in advance, helping with eating & shopping locally, and upgrading us to a lovely big room. He seems to really care about his guests, despite the fact that we're very transient and I was impressed with the eco friendly products and recycling. We used the laundry which was much needed after about 10 days travelling and were able to walk to most places very easily. The visit was tinged with sadness at the devastation in Christchurch but there seems to be a huge amount of resilience in the people and hope for the future.

Hello pem243 and thank you for the review. Once again, we are pleased to see such a seasoned Trip Advisor user satisfied with their stay with us. Glad you liked our style of service and our eco stance. And yes! while the laundry machine does its magic you can take a stroll to see the latest in Christchurch. After the quakes the cityscape is changing almost daily and we are happy to see things moving forward!

Hello Stuartessaouira and thank you for the review. It is indeed an honour to get a review from a well travelled reviewer. We agree with you that we are a good motel close to town. We also agree that in some parts of town, there is not much left to see but in other parts there are things to see and we can give advice to our guests on the best places to go! Thanks for the review.

“Family Re-Union”


Reviewed March 14, 2012




Went to Christchurch for a family re-union & needed somewhere close to the city centre. CentrePoint on Columbo was perfectly located and reasonable well priced. The complementaries & eco-friendly way in which they are presented is a breath of fresh air in today's fast paced consumerist world. Providing a recycling basket & eco-friendly (the brand) shampoo, conditioner, handwash & dishwashing liquid was a step in the right direction espescially for staying in line with the Clean, Green New Zealand image.

“Helpful hosts, lovely and comfortable room”


Reviewed March 13, 2012




We stayed in the deluxe studio, which was spacious, clean, and very well-equipped to ensure a comfortable stay. The welcome cookies and sweets were a nice touch too. Many thanks to Jeff who assisted us in so many ways. He kindly emailed us in advance to advise us on the congested roads to avoid, helped us book our dinner at Bodhi Tree, and told us about the places to explore in Christchurch. His willingness to go the extra mile left an impression with us. We would stay here again when we return to Christchurch.

“Must agree with other recent reviews!”


Reviewed March 12, 2012




This was our first stop in NZ, and what a great way to start. Helpful, informative owners, clean, spacious accommodations, and attention to detail. The other recent reviews of this property are right on. I hope to come back to Christchurch, and would definitely stay here again. My heart goes out to the people of Christchurch...still a wonderful city despite all the quake damage. Thanks for a wonderful stay!


Room Tip: A room away from the parking lot/stairs would be quieter.

“Great spot in Christchurch”


Reviewed March 8, 2012




The Centerpoint on Columbo was the perfect place to stay to explore Christchurch on foot. Jeff pointed out must see places and helped with travel out to Akaroa. It was very clean and spacious and we would definately return. The small kitchen and refrigerator were a big plus as we had just moved out of a camper. Thanks Jeff!

“Great lodging, friendly and helpful owners.”


Reviewed March 6, 2012




The room itself was nice, and clean with a small kitchen and good sized bathroom. They have laundry facilities on-site, but be aware that there is only one washer and one dryer, so hopefully you won't be competing with anyone for their use (we had no issues doing our laundry at about 9 am). The owners are so friendly and helpful with places to eat, things to do, and navigating the city. I would recommend this as a place to stay.

Limited Liability Company (LLC)
中文 | 한국어 | TiếngViệt | Pусский
A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a business structure allowed by state statute. Each state may use different regulations, and you should check with your state if you are interested in starting a Limited Liability Company.
Owners of an LLC are called members. Most states do not restrict ownership, and so members may include individuals, corporations, other LLCs and foreign entities. There is no maximum number of members. Most states also permit “single-member” LLCs, those having only one owner.
A few types of businesses generally cannot be LLCs, such as banks and insurance companies. Check your state’s requirements and the federal tax regulations for further information. There are special rules for foreign LLCs.
Classifications
Depending on elections made by the LLC and the number of members, the IRS will treat an LLC as either a corporation, partnership, or as part of the LLC’s owner’s tax return (a “disregarded entity”). Specifically, a domestic LLC with at least two members is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes unless it files Form 8832 and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation. And an LLC with only one member is treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its owner for income tax purposes (but as a separate entity for purposes of employment tax and certain excise taxes), unless it files Form 8832 and affirmatively elects to be treated as a corporation.
Effective Date of Election
An LLC that does not want to accept its default federal tax classification, or that wishes to change its classification, uses Form 8832, Entity Classification Election, to elect how it will be classified for federal tax purposes. Generally, an election specifying an LLC’s classification cannot take effect more than 75 days prior to the date the election is filed, nor can it take effect later than 12 months after the date the election is filed. An LLC may be eligible for late election relief in certain circumstances. See Form 8832 General Instructions for more information.
