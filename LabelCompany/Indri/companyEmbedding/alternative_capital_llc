Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?

ACA in the News
Conn. Plan Makes Hedge Fund Hire
findaily.com
The $323 million Milford (Conn.) Retirement System hired Alternative Capital Advisers
to manage a customized hedge fund portfolio at its June 16 board meeting.
The plan hired ACA to manage an approximately $5 million portfolio, Consultant John Beirne
of general investment consultant Beirne Wealth Consulting said.
The portfolio will comprised of three sub-managers—long/short equity manager Eastbay Asset Management
and two long/short credit managers. John Beirne could not provide the names of the two credit managers and ACA declined to comment.
Funding for ACA will come from incumbent long/short equity hedge fund manager Sterling Ridge Capital Management,
which is shutting down at the end of this month.
The plan began a hedge fund replacement search in May (fin|daily, 5/20).
Separately, the plan made follow-on commitments of $10 million to private equity fund Longford Capital Management
and $3 million to real assets firm Corrum Capital Management and a new commitment of $3 million to private equity firm
BlackDiamond Capital Management, John Beirne said.

Risks & Disclosures – Alternative Capital Advisers

























Skip to content











Risks & Disclosures





For informational purposes only. This document should not be construed as providing any type of investment, legal, tax or other advice to you and should not be relied upon as such. You should not consider this to be a solicitation, recommendation, endorsement or offer to you to purchase or sell any financial security or other financial instrument.
This summary of certain risks is not a complete list of the risks and other important disclosures involved in investing in a hedge fund and is subject to the more complete disclosures contained in a specific hedge fund’s respective offering documents. You should read those documents carefully before you invest to determine whether an investment is suitable for you in light of, among other things, your financial situation, need for liquidity, tax situation, and other investments.
The risks associated with investing in a Hedge Fund generally include:
LIMITED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT: Since Hedge Funds are typically private investments, they do not face the same oversight and scrutiny from financial regulatory entities such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or the UK’s Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) and are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as regulated open-end investment companies, mutual funds or Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), including requirements for such entities to provide certain periodic pricing and valuation information to investors, or certain closed-end investment companies. Hedge fund offering documents are not reviewed or approved by the SEC or any US state securities administrator or by the FSA or any other national, supra-national or local regulatory body. Also, managers may not be required by law or regulation to supply investors with their portfolio holdings, pricing, or valuation information.
PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION; VOLATILITY: Many Hedge Funds may have a more concentrated or less diversified portfolio than an average mutual fund, UCITS, or other authorized collective investment scheme. For example, a mutual fund or other authorized collective investment scheme may have 100 to 200 positions while a Hedge Fund can average between 25 and 45 positions. While a more concentrated portfolio can have good results when a manager is correct, it can also cause a portfolio to have higher volatility.
STRATEGY RISK: Many Hedge Funds employ a single investment strategy. Thus, a Hedge Fund or even a fund of Hedge Funds may be subject to strategy risk, associated with the failure or deterioration of an entire strategy. Strategy specific losses can result from excessive concentration by multiple Hedge Fund managers in the same investment or broad events that adversely affect particular strategies.
USE OF LEVERAGE AND OTHER SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT PRACTICES: Since many Hedge Fund managers use leverage and speculative investment strategies such as options and short sales, investors should be aware of the potential risks. When used prudently and for the purpose of risk reduction, these instruments can add value to a portfolio. However, when leverage is used excessively and the market goes down, a portfolio can suffer tremendously. Also, managers can face additional risk when selling short. In theory, the loss associated with shorted stocks is infinite, because stocks can go up indefinitely. So, while selling short can add return and risk reduction to a portfolio, managers need to pay special attention to their short positions. In the same way, when options are used to hedge a portfolio (i.e., short calls and buy puts), the portfolio’s volatility can be reduced. However, when options are used to speculate (i.e., buy calls, short puts), a portfolio’s returns can suffer and the risk of the portfolio can increase.

We listen to you and when you explain your plans for working capital, we tailor a product to your needs and your timeline. Alternative Business Capital provides access to the most suitable and most recognized names in lending. Should you have special needs we have private investors with specialized knowledge throughout industry.Communication is so important. Contact us or give us a way to open the door with you.  Once we are able to quantify your needs we can very easily and spontaneously match you and your business with qualifying loan programs.

Once you decide on a loan that feels right and makes sense, we will provide a meaningful approval, in less than an hour in many cases, and you will receive your funds within one to seven days. So consider the following:Fast approvals24 HOUR FUNDINGLittle or no paperworkWe can help a start-upAlternative Business Capital understands Small Business capital needs and is knowledgeable in assisting with start-up funding procurement for entrepreneurs nationwide. Our mission is providing access to the services and funding needs to turn your start-up concept into a business with a physical location, employees, equipment and paying customers!Our experience in business consulting and finance is that business owners searching for funding are usually lacking the knowledge of what is required to obtain business capital. Also, business owners find that when they approach their Business Banker, by the time they want to lend you money, you don’t need it.Alternative Business Capital can be the bridge in positioning, to you, the business owner to facilitate a successful funding procurement solution. Although Alternative Business Capital provides innovative technology and industry experience we’ve found that what sets us apart from large institutions and robotic underwriting processes is that we take the time to communicate, ask the right questions, and assist in your success. We know that we can play a major part in your financial growth and in your business success.
























ALTERNATIVE BUSINESS CAPITAL – What sets us apart.No application fees:Some Lenders charge an application fee on all submissions. Others will charge an application fee on successful transactions and debit it from the borrower’s account. Alternative Business Capital does not charge for applications – period.High Quality Lending Partners:It is important to know that the lender you are working with is well-capitalized and transparent; Alternative Business Capital has vetted our current roster of lenders and is always searching for partners that meet those standards.Single Submissions*Many Brokers send your application to multiple lenders as soon as it is received. This is a dangerous practice as it can lead to several “hard checks” on your personal credit, which ultimately has a negative impact on your credit rating. Alternative Business Capital carefully reviews your application and any supporting documentation then forwards it only to the lender we believe is your best match. If your application is denied, we find out the reason and communicate with you directly. Before we send it to another Partner/lender, we ask your permission.Alternative Business Capital is not a lender. We provide a service to prospective borrowers wherein we submit their secure application information to our network of lenders. We do not collect a fee from the applicants. Our mission is to match prospective borrowers with our preferred network of Lenders. There is no guarantee that your application will be approved by any of our lenders and all financial terms are negotiated directly between the borrower and the Lender. As such, Alternative Business Capital does not make decisions regarding funding. Therefore, nothing on this website should be construed as an offer or solicitation for financing of any kind. This service may not be available in all states and our terms may change at any time without prior notice

Instant Business Financing: Your Way Forward
Taking your business to the next level requires a few things: hard work, ingenuity, determination and the cash flow to make your vision a reality. Money doesn’t grow on trees, but it does grow companies.
You guide the funding, we provide it. Simple. Quick. Transparent.
In the rapidly-changing world of commerce, businesses require solutions that move just as fast as the economy they are a part of. Cash flow loans shouldn’t require waiting months; they should enable owners and operators to get the job done as soon as they can.
Old-school avenues to small business financing require six-month waiting periods, excellent credit history and filling out dozens of pages of paperwork. Bank loans are often reserved for those with excellent credit, plenty of collateral and the luxury of being able to wait months for approval. Traditional lenders make their process time-consuming and complex, with multiple identity checks and proofs of ownership. Our business financing ethos is different.
Fast Capital 360 gives you the amount of funding you need in days, not weeks or months. We’ve built our business funding company around the idea that you shouldn’t have to wait, you should be able to receive your cash flow quickly.
Since 2009, our instant small business financing services have enabled thousands of companies to realize their fullest potential. We believe in the power of the local economy, and we want to influence it to do great things; that’s why we work with small business owners across the country.  Our instant business loans fuel innovation from coast to coast.
Whether you’re in the market for SBA loans or unsecured funding, we’re here to provide you with the funds you need.


HOW FAST IS FAST?10 minutes stands between you and knowing how much funding you qualify for. Your small business loan can arrive in your bank account in as little as one business day. No collateral required.
The average online application process takes less than 10 minutes and is only a page long. Once your financing program is approved, your working capital funding can arrive by the end of the next business day.
WE KEEP THINGS EASY & QUICKThere are no long clauses to wade through, no complicated terms and conditions, just plain language that clearly defines what you’re getting in a fast approval business loan. Fast Capital 360 is a member of the Responsible Business Lending Coalition; we were founded on the principles of lending fairness and transparency. We aren’t here to put you in debt; we’re here to fund the American dream.
QUALIFICATIONS?To qualify for instant funding, your small business needs to have been in operation for more than a year, have a revenue of at least $180,000, and you need to have a personal credit score of 500 or more. Our quick business lending is unsecured, so you don’t have to pledge personal assets or collateral just to receive a loan.



Get a Business Loan Today
We designed our process around getting small businesses the money they need quickly. Fast is in our name for a reason. Our application takes next to no time so you can get back to doing what you do best — running your business.
We’ve been voted the best small business funding company by CrowdReviews.com because of our dedication to supporting the economy that we are all a part of with fast approval loans.
The process of receiving funding for your expansion, your repairs, your staffing or your vision shouldn’t make running your business any more difficult. This is instant business funding without the hassle. We want you to have your money quick; you probably have better things to do than wait around for an approval letter.
From microloans to new property purchases, our fast funding process has been there for thousands of businesses. We offer multiple business loan options from lending that functions like a credit card to those that work the same as a bank loan, all with cash delivered faster than ever before.
Whether you have questions about receiving instant restaurant funding or your current working capital funding, our small business advisors are standing by six days a week to help.
Business factoring services allow you to know the exact amount you’ll pay and make our funding work even faster. Through our proprietary business analysis, we determine a precise factor rate that is included in our financing program. This business factor rate is included in the fast approval loan. Where banks charge interest rates, our business factoring services clearly outline how much is to be included in each payment from the start to the finish of the term.
Rather than taking out another credit card, our online business lending services allows you a safer alternative that provides you with more accessible business cash and less likelihood of accruing debt. Better than the banks, our commercial financing programs get business owners the money they need faster than anyone else.
A quick business funding solution that encompasses every need? That’s Fast Capital 360.
Still on the fence?
