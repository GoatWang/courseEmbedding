MMJ Business Solutions


Based in Denver, Colorado American Cannabis Company Inc. was founded to meet the needs of the rapidly developing regulated cannabis industry. We provide end-to-end consulting and product solutions for the medical, adult use and low-THC regulated cannabis markets both nationally and internationally.
Our cannabis industry specific advisory and consulting services are built to meet the needs of companies entering or currently operating in the regulated cannabis markets. Deeply experienced in the regulated markets, our services span over all phases of operations. From licensing and construction to cultivation, processing and dispensing, we have you covered.
American Cannabis Company has also developed a portfolio of branded products including: The Satchel™, SoHum Living Soils™, Cultivation Cube™ and High Density Cultivation System™.


Founders


Corey Hollister and Ellis Smith began their cannabis careers in Boulder, Colorado. They are former co-owners of a vertically integrated cannabis business that commercialized a niche cultivation methodology known as “True Living Organics” (TLO) on a regulated commercial scale for the production of medicinal cannabis. This dedication to a medicinally focused cultivation approach earned them national recognition from Skunk Magazine in 2010.
The founders have been invited speakers at multiple national events, provided their expert opinion to state and federal bodies and have been contributors to numerous media publications and outlets.


Experience


Having experience as former owners and operators of a regulated cannabis business, the foundation was set for American Cannabis Consulting (now American Cannabis Company Inc.) as well as for the development and design of an industry tailored product suite. Through a culmination of efforts, ACC established the Geoponics Methodology of cultivation which promotes genetic optimization of the cannabis plant.
ACC has now assisted clients in winning over 13 cannabis licenses in eight states, demonstrating its deep understanding of the sector and how to comply with state regulations.  The company has designed over a half million square feet of industry facilities and completed state-of-the-art indoor and greenhouse build-outs in multiple states. In addition to the United States, ACC is active internationally in both its cannabis consulting and product divisions. The company has assisted two companies with securing operational approvals from Health Canada. ACC has established its proven ability to provide services for every stage of a cannabis business, encompassing:

Merit-based cannabis license applications and phase 2 approvals, business/operational plans, and standard operating procedures;
Facility design & build-out, equipment selection, and construction management;
Facility roll-out, employee training, and on-going management;
Continued compliance monitoring and/or auditing.

Additional articles in SKUNK Magazine highlighted the use of True Living Organics (TLO) cultivation methodology in a regulated, commercial market. Mr. Smith’s career path has positioned him to play an integral role in assisting individual companies flourish and ensure emerging cannabis markets prosper as a whole.

Mr. Buffalo is regarded as an expert in these fields with publications in Financial Advisor Magazine and NAIFA’s Advisor Today, as well taking part in a featured interview posted in Boomer Market Advisor. Prior to founding Buffalo Financial Solutions, Buffalo was the Chief Executive Officer of a regional broker dealer for over 10 years, where he took an underperforming firm and revamped the business model from a corporate to an independent structure, with an emphasis on attracting brokers with established clientele.

Our Network of Expert Partners




Success in the regulated cannabis markets takes a small army of qualified professionals who share your vision and business ethics. We help align you with key partners to support turning your dreams into a reality.






Legal
From experts in cannabis, intellectual property and/or business we can align you with the right fit to fulfill your legal needs.






Accounting
With the banking challenges and complexities of 280E the right accounting partner can mean the difference between success and failure.






Finance
From the merit-based application process to the cost of facility build-out, the capital requirements for entering the regulated cannabis markets are intensive. However, it is also a rapid growth industry with significant interest from the investment community. We can help position you to secure the right capital partners who share your vision.






Human Resources
As with any industry, human capital is one of your most important assets. In addition to our internal staffing services we provide you with partners who deliver turn-key human resource solutions. From executive recruiting and payroll to health insurance, our partners can help you to overcome some of the biggest hurdles in the regulated cannabis industry.






Operations
Successful, compliant operations require the right expert solutions. Examples include environmental control systems, seed-to-sale tracking systems and smart lighting technology. We help you evaluate these opportunities and select the right fit for your company.






Security
Your security plan and system is critical for obtaining licensing approval and ensuring successful operations. Mitigating the risk of theft and/or diversion is achieved by working with security partners who understand the unique requirements of operating in the regulated cannabis space.






Real Estate
As with any industry, location is key. With many states allowing cities and and counties to opt out of the adopted program, the importance of location is amplified in the cannabis markets. Site location can be one of the biggest challenges especially in emerging markets. The right real estate partner armed with the right location specifications will get you over this hurdle.

NEW YORK, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --








According to a research report by Ameri Research Inc., the global legal cannabis market was valued at $14.3 billion in 2016 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 21.1% from 2017 to 2024. By 2024, the projected demand of cannabis will continue to rise for both recreational and medical use, while reaching an estimated global sales value of $63.5 billion. The legal cannabis market is witnessing robust growth thanks to successful legalization and decriminalization campaigns across North America and Europe. The report also points that due to the complex regulatory structure at the state level and federal level, the full potential of the market is not yet realized. ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTC: CIIX), American Cannabis Company, Inc. (OTC: AMMJ), Terra Tech Corp. (OTC: TRTC), MassRoots Inc. (OTC: MSRT), CV Sciences, Inc. (OTC: CVSI)
A major submarket of the legal cannabis industry is the Hemp and CBD market. According to a research conducted by Hemp Business Journal and Vote Hemp, the Hemp CBD is a market with $130 million in sales with growth at a 53% AGR (Adjusted Growth Revenue). The Hemp CBD category was led by channel sales in natural and specialty products such as smoke shops and online verticals. Eric Steenstra, President of Vote Hemp has referenced, "To date, 31 states have passed legislation that allows hemp farming per provisions set forth in the 2014 Farm Bill, and the U.S. remains the largest consumer market for hemp products worldwide. We need Congress to pass federal legislation to allow commercial hemp farming nationally, to let our farmers and American businesses take advantage of the robust economic opportunity hemp provides."    
ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. (OTCQB: CIIX) just announced earlier this morning that, "it will attend the Southern California Investment Forum ("SCIF") and the FreedomFest 10th Anniversary later this month in Las Vegas.
CIIX will also participate in the 10th annual FreedomFest festival (https://freedomfest.com) scheduled for July 19-22 at the Paris Las Vegas Hotel & Casino. FreedomFest attracts thousands of thought influencers from around the world to gather, talk, strategize, socialize, and network with other experts and leaders. The conference also provides entrepreneurs a platform to showcase their operations to investors looking for opportunities to benefit their portfolio.
"I am delighted that CIIX has been invited to attend the Southern California Investment Forum and FreedomFest 10th Anniversary," says Warren Wang, founder and CEO of CIIX. "FreedomFest is one of the most well-known investor festivals, and we look forward to networking with the impressive turn-out expected for its 10th anniversary. Participating in these two events provides us with a valuable opportunity to meet with investors face-to-face and to introduce our latest business updates and developments to a new audience."
CIIX is in the early stages of penetrating the world's non-industrial hemp market through its retail and e-commerce channels and its network marketing channels that are in development Leveraging a diversified approach, CIIX is positioned to capitalize on rising demand and acceptance in this growing industry. The Company's core business of financial education has also been strengthened by a significant upgrade to its platform.
"We encourage the investment community to come to our booth at FreedomFest to learn more about CIIX and the incredible opportunities that await," says Warren.
American Cannabis Company, Inc. (OTCQB: AMMJ) offers end-to-end solutions to existing and aspiring participants in the cannabis sector. Recently, the company announced that its proprietary product SoHum Living Soils®(SoHum®), has won the 2017 High Times STASH award for "Best Potting Mix." SoHum® is a proprietary "just add water" growing medium that contains 100% natural ingredients and provides the cannabis plant a full buffet of macro/micro nutrients to better achieve genetic potential as well as an optimal cannabinoid profile. Not only does SoHum® optimize the plant's yield and quality, it also eliminates the need for complex feeding schedules and the associated risk(s) of operator error, as well as reducing time and labor. 
Terra Tech Corp. (OTCQX: TRTC) is a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company. The company recently announced its Dual Use Marijuana business licenses have been approved by the State of Nevada Department of Taxation. This approval allows all four of the Company's Blüm cannabis dispensaries in Nevada to commence sales of cannabis for adult-use, starting Saturday, July 1, 2017. As one of the medical cannabis companies granted approval to expand into the adult-use market, Terra Tech can now serve the needs of both medical patients and adult use customers alike in the same facility. This represents a major expansion of the Company's potential customer base which also includes the 40+ million tourists who visit the Las Vegas Area, and the almost five million tourists who visit Reno, annually.
MassRoots Inc. (OTCQB: MSRT) is one of the largest technology platforms for the regulated cannabis industry. Recently, MassRoots and Odava, Inc. have executed a Definitive Agreement for MassRoots to acquire Odava for cash and shares of MassRoots' common stock. Odava is an industry-leading platform technology that provides compliance, point-of-sale, and supply chain management for the cannabis industry. The combination of the two companies is expected to create one of the largest technology conglomerates in the cannabis market and now will also be providing regulatory compliance, point-of-sale and consumer engagement programs for the entire industry.
CV Sciences, Inc. (OTCQB: CVSI) operates two distinct business segments: a drug development division focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic CBD; and a consumer product division in manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products to a range of market sectors. The company recently provided an update on published outcomes of recent clinical research on pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol (CBD) pointing to its therapeutic potential as a prescription drug. CV Sciences is devoted to the pioneering development of a prescription synthetic CBD as an adjunct to nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT) in the treatment of smokeless tobacco (ST) addiction. There is no approved therapy for smokeless tobacco addiction. CV Sciences believes that its initial drug candidate to treat smokeless tobacco addiction can dramatically improve patient outcomes for millions.

Priorities in this new and emerging industry are quickly transitioning to traditional business challenges such as operational efficiency, quality assurance, regulatory compliance and market penetration. In addition, operators still face the ongoing unique challenges in the medical and/or adult use cannabis markets such as 280E and barriers to banking. American Cannabis Company provides a purpose-built mix of cannabis consulting and ancillary products to meet your ongoing and future needs. When it’s time to level up, we provide the catalyst.
