	We follow a philosophy that low-turnover, concentrated portfolios derived from sound bottom-up fundamental research provide an opportunity for attractive performance results over time. We have a culture and firm equity ownership structure that help us attract and retain professionals who share those beliefs, and we follow a repeatable investment process that helps us stay true to our philosophy.

	We construct balanced portfolios for private clients, nonprofits and institutions depending on the needs of the client. We can be 100% open architecture, using third-party managers only, or we can put together a mix of internal and external strategies, whatever is in the client's best interest.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Our Philosophy
Our Clients
Our Culture
Our History
Our People
 







In 1993, we founded Brown Advisory with a simple vision: to build an investment firm that is entirely focused on making a material and positive difference for our clients over time.
 
























					Thought•ful:



					1. Absorbed in or involving thought.





					/THôtfəl/



					2. Showing consideration for the needs of other people.





	 


(top-left to bottom-right)
	Michael D. Hankin; Daily Research Meeting; Logie Fitzwilliams and Keryn Brock; Ben Griswold; Dune Thorne; Porter Schutt and Bill Dugdale.

	Our mission remains the same today as when we opened our doors: to be a firm where every action we take, every investment strategy we employ, every decision we make, puts clients first. To award professionals an ownership stake in the company so that everyone sees their interests as aligned with our clients' long-term success. To be a firm that you would build for yourself, if given a blank slate. To be relevant to our clients five, 10 and 20 years from now. To be the firm to which all our clients turn and ask: What do you think I should do? In short, to be regarded by our clients as thoughtful investors.

	To fulfill that mission, we have carefully cultivated a culture of putting the needs and aspirations of clients before our own.


					Learn About Our Clients				

















					Brown Advisory's DNA				






	We firmly believe that our cultural DNA distinguishes us from other firms in our industry.


OUR CULTURE:
		Putting Clients First

		This principle pervades everything we do, not only because it is good for business, but also because we truly care about our clients. We feel privileged to work with them, as they do impressive work: raising successful families, building leading businesses, guiding important nonprofits, overseeing pensions that help people retire well and otherwise making a difference in the world. We take personal satisfaction in helping our clients succeed. That is Brown Advisory in a nutshell.

Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy



	Private Equity, Real Estate and Energy

	Brown Advisory has incorporated private equity and real estate investments in client portfolios since our founding. Today, we can provide that exposure in three distinct ways.

Feeder Funds and Multimanager Funds
	We introduce clients to investment opportunities in early- and late-stage venture capital and buyout funds, as well as select real estate funds. We also construct these feeder funds into multimanager funds to make private equity investing as easy as possible for our clients.

Customized Private Equity Portfolios
	For most clients, private equity is one component of a balanced portfolio that we manage. Other clients, however, come to us specifically for custom-built private equity and real estate portfolios.

	For more information on private equity please click here or contact Jacob Hodes at 410-537-5315 or [email protected].

Brown Advisory - Private Clients








Overview
Performance
Advice
Service
 







To invest, advise and serve on your behalf, we at Brown Advisory begin with a simple but important step: We listen—to you.
We build our relationships on a foundation of careful listening, so we can understand each client's specific situation, and the role that they want us to play for them. Some clients are looking for a pure investment advisor, while others may seek more of a "family quarterback"; some clients look to us to manage their money ourselves, while others seek our assistance in selecting top-quality external managers. 

It all begins with listening. We ask you about your concerns, your needs and your hopes so that we can craft a customized plan to deliver the investment performance, strategic advice and client service that you deserve.













Performance



	We strive to help you navigate complex markets to achieve your investment goals. For most clients, we oversee balanced portfolios, while for others we invest in just a specific asset class or a single strategy.

Learn More





Advice



	We act as your advocate, helping you make good decisions on a wide range of challenges from planning issues to philanthropy to family businesses.

Learn More





Service



	We pledge to serve you with proactive attention, clear communication and complete confidentiality.

Our Philosophy
Our Clients
Our Culture
Our History
Our People
 







In 1993, we founded Brown Advisory with a simple vision: to build an investment firm that is entirely focused on making a material and positive difference for our clients over time.
 
























					Thought•ful:



					1. Absorbed in or involving thought.





					/THôtfəl/



					2. Showing consideration for the needs of other people.





	 


(top-left to bottom-right)
	Michael D. Hankin; Daily Research Meeting; Logie Fitzwilliams and Keryn Brock; Ben Griswold; Dune Thorne; Porter Schutt and Bill Dugdale.

	Our mission remains the same today as when we opened our doors: to be a firm where every action we take, every investment strategy we employ, every decision we make, puts clients first. To award professionals an ownership stake in the company so that everyone sees their interests as aligned with our clients' long-term success. To be a firm that you would build for yourself, if given a blank slate. To be relevant to our clients five, 10 and 20 years from now. To be the firm to which all our clients turn and ask: What do you think I should do? In short, to be regarded by our clients as thoughtful investors.

	To fulfill that mission, we have carefully cultivated a culture of putting the needs and aspirations of clients before our own.


					Learn About Our Clients				

















					Brown Advisory's DNA				






	We firmly believe that our cultural DNA distinguishes us from other firms in our industry.


OUR CULTURE:
		Putting Clients First

		This principle pervades everything we do, not only because it is good for business, but also because we truly care about our clients. We feel privileged to work with them, as they do impressive work: raising successful families, building leading businesses, guiding important nonprofits, overseeing pensions that help people retire well and otherwise making a difference in the world. We take personal satisfaction in helping our clients succeed. That is Brown Advisory in a nutshell.

Brown Advisory LLC


                  Brown Advisory's investment approach is based on the belief that low-turnover, concentrated portfolios derived from sound bottom-up fundamental research provide an opportunity for attractive performance results over time. The firm constructs balanced portfolios for private clients, non-profit organizations and and institutions depending on the needs of the client. They offer access to a wide range of investment opportunities and asset classes, including international equities, emerging market equities, global fixed income, high-yield fixed income, private equity, commodities, hedge funds and real estate.The firm's equity investment strategies seek to provide clients with long-term capital appreciation by actively selecting securities for investment in concentrated portfolios. Their equity strategies strive to outperform relevant benchmark indices over the long-term. Brown Advisory employs a bottom-up, fundamental research approach to the identification, examination and eventual selection of securities for their portfolios. Individual position weightings are largely a function of their conviction regarding a security’s long-term appreciation potential; securities with the greatest upside potential relative to downside risk tend to be the largest positions in their portfolios. They manage position sizes actively, trimming fully valued holdings and deploying that capital into existing or new holdings with more attractive valuations, in an effort to consistently optimize the portfolio from a risk/reward perspective. Brown Advisory offers the following equity investment strategies: Large-Cap Growth, Flexible Equity, Equity Income, Small-Cap Growth, Small-Cap Value, Mid-Cap Growth, Large-Cap Sustainable Growth, All-Cap, Emerging Markets, Strategic European Equity,  Japan Alpha Opportunities, Emerging Markets Small-Cap, Global Leaders, Fundamental Long/Short, and Conscious Alpha.Brown Advisory's fixed income process seeks to invest in bonds with capital appreciation potential that is not related to the general movement of interest rates. This philosophy is applied to their long-only fixed income strategies within the context of maintaining a core stability of principal value. They are more focused on specific bonds or bond structures rather than broad sector weightings and seek to concentrate investments in a relatively concentrated portfolio of high-conviction ideas. Brown Advisory's fixed income strategies include: Intermediate Income, Core Fixed Income,  Limited Duration, Intermediate Municipal, Enhanced Cash, Mortgage Securities, Total Return Strategy, Strategic Bond Strategy, Core Sustainable Fixed Income, and Tax-Exempt Sustainable Fixed Income.

In addition, the firm works with other asset management firms to offer clients access to other strategies including US Small-Cap Value Equity, International Equity, hedge funds-of-funds, alternative asset classes, venture capital funds, buy-out private equity funds, real estate funds and a variety of co-investments.Brown's large-cap growth strategy seeks to invest in diversified portfolios of companies with superior fundamentals, strong, sustainable revenue and earnings growth and attractive valuations. They invest in US large-cap growth stocks and typically hold them for several years. Brown employs fundamental research to select securities and sectors that offer highly competitive, tax-efficient returns. They seek to identify market-leading companies or companies with the potential to become market leaders. They look for rich product cycles, large, growing markets, strong cash flow, proprietary products/services and productive new product development efforts. Brown also looks for growth stock development that occurs after the initial phase of growth in which a catalyst causes rejuvenated growth.Brown's Large-Cap Value strategy seeks to identify out-of-favor situations with downside risk of no more than 20% and upside potential of at least 40%. They look for sound, financially strong, growing companies with proven shareholder-sensitive management. Their strategy is multi-cap, with a minimum market-cap of $500 million and no maximum. Companies should have above average earnings growth, above average profitability and below average valuations. Investments are diversified across a wide range of industries. The firm employs a bottom-up portfolio construction process that is based on the specific attractiveness of each holding.The firm's Small-Cap Growth strategy seeks to invest early and hold investments for the long-term. Brown looks for companies with large business opportunities relative to the company's size and proprietary technology, products, services or distribution systems. Management must have a clear, measurable plan to produce sustainable earnings growth of more than 20% a year. At the time of purchase, stocks must have a market-cap of not more than the largest company in the Russell 2000 Growth Index.Brown actively manages fixed-income portfolios. They employ a disciplined investment process that seeks to exploit changes in sector spreads, security valuations, interest rate trends and yield curve dynamics.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
