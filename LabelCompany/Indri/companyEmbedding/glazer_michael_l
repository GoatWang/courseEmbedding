Good morning and welcome to Stage Stores Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, the company will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your moderator for today's conference call, Ms. Randi Sonenshein, Senior Vice President of Finance and Strategy. Ms. Sonenshein, please begin your conference call.
Randi Sonenshein - Senior Vice President, Finance and Strategy, Stage Stores, Inc.
Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to Stage Stores first quarter conference call. Also with us on the call this morning is Michael Glazer, President and Chief Executive Officer; Oded Shein, Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Lawrence, Chief Merchandising Officer. Michael and Oded will begin with prepared remarks and we will all then be available to take your questions.
Our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements reflecting our projections for future events and performance. Various factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For more information on those factors, please refer to the Risk Factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC, and this morning's earnings release. Forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and we undertake no obligation to update those statements.
I'll now turn the call over to Michael.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Randi, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter conference call. I'll begin today's call by providing an overview of our performance for the quarter, and we'll then discuss the progress that we are making on our goals for 2015 and the long-term. Oded will follow with a review of our financial results, and Steve is here as well to answer questions.
We are pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter. While it was challenging from a top-line perspective, our merchandise margin expansion and solid expense management helped to deliver favorable bottom-line results which improved 29% to a loss of $0.27. We achieved this during a difficult selling environment which included a shift in our own marketing calendar that I will describe shortly.
As you have probably already heard from many retailers, there were several factors that put pressure on sales during the first quarter. I have to start with weather because it had a major impact on us as it disrupted sales especially in the South Central and Southeast parts of the country. Some of our stores were closed for extended periods as various government officials deemed road conditions unsafe. Kentucky, where we have 34 stores, was a good example of this and turned out to be our worst performing state for the quarter.
We have 26 stores on the Mexican border. And as most of you know, these are some of our highest volume stores. Sales in those stores suffered as a result of the strong dollar. The weaker peso has made discretionary spending in the U.S. much more expensive for our loyal Mexican national customers. Delays created by the West Coast port strike also had some effect on our first quarter business specifically in footwear.

Then, of course, there is the question of energy and whether the loss of jobs is impacting us or whether lower gas prices are offsetting any drop in employment. It continues to be difficult to measure or pinpoint the answer to that question. If you exclude our border stores, our Texas sales were better than our overall company average. Stores in many cities whose economies are driven by oil drilling such as Odessa and Midland were weaker. But the strongest area in the company in the first quarter was Houston. So, I guess the answer is that it's impossible to make a conclusive call at this time. My opinion for what it's worth is that it is somewhat of a headwind in specific energy areas but not nearly as severe as has been suggested.
With regard to the change in the timing of our advertising for Mother's Day, we saw an opportunity to increase Mother's Day sales and intentionally made a shift in our marketing calendar from the end of the first quarter to the start of the second quarter. This marketing shift created huge excitement at our stores and clearly paid off because it generated record sales for the Mother's Day week.
As I mentioned in our press release, our year-to-date comp sales were positive for the first 14 weeks of the year. Going back to first quarter, cosmetics and home were the best categories while men's and accessories were the weakest. Some of our strongest sales were reflected in the high-profile brands such as Nike, Calvin Klein, Skechers, Estée Lauder and Carter's. Activewear remains the most dominant trend, up double-digits while denim continues to be a little sluggish.
As you know, a primary focus for us is to raise sales productivity. We planned to take a greater share of our customers' wallet and to accelerate growth in our direct-to-consumer business. This will put Stage Stores on a path to consistent sales and earnings growth. To accomplish this, we are focused on four key areas. One, creating a great omni-channel experience; two, increasing our emphasis on trends and styles; three, improving the store environment; and four, better connecting with our customers. First and foremost is our direct-to-consumer business which grew 31% during the quarter. We reached a number of milestones, and for the first time, we had more mobile and tablet visitors than those using a desktop. We launched a mobile optimized site. We expanded the assortments and grew centralized fulfillment, all resulting in a better customer experience.
I am also thrilled to announce that we strengthened our management team with the recent hiring of a new Senior Vice President of e-commerce, Mike Smith. Mike's background includes Signet Jewelers, Home Depot, Spiegel and The Limited. As we previously discussed, our mission is to provide a merchandise assortment that is compelling to our customer with high-profile national brands and updated styles at a great value.
In cosmetics, our plan this year is to roll out Estée Lauder and Clinique counters in 30 stores and Smashbox and Origin counters in 20 more stores. We also plan to continue our home department expansion with 45 more stores this year. In addition to making sure our merchandise selections are compelling, we are focused on improving our store environment. Our customer comes first, and she wants an exceptional shopping experience every day. As part of this key strategy, we shifted capital from opening new stores to updating our existing fleet, with upgrades to fixtures, more mannequins, comfortable fitting rooms, improved lighting, enhanced navigation, and wider aisles.
Our systematic remodeling program has already begun, and we plan to have a small group of stores completed by the end of the second quarter. As you know, our plan is to update over 100 of our stores this year. We should get a slight lift in the third quarter with the bulk of the impact being felt in the critical fourth quarter.

Last but certainly not least, we are taking steps to strengthen our connection to our customer. We are focused on shifting mediums to reach her where she is, that means more digital and mobile, while tailoring our communications to make a more personalized connection. We will also be piloting enhancements to our loyalty program in select markets later this year. In addition, we will continue to leverage and build upon our private label credit card, with a card reissuance in time for the holidays.
In conclusion, the first quarter on its own was challenging from a top-line perspective, but our margin expansion and solid expense management helped to deliver favorable bottom-line results. We are thrilled with our Mother's Day performance and definitely are on track with our expectations. We are reaffirming our annual outlook of flat to positive 2% comparable sales growth and EPS of $1.20 to $1.28. We are confident in our ability to deliver sales and earnings growth this year. Our entire company is focused on and excited about the strategies that we have in place. There are a lot of positives in our plan for the year, and we feel good about the direction of the company and the initiatives that are under way.
I'll now turn the call over to Oded.
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
Thanks, Michael, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the first quarter were $369 million. Comparable sales for the quarter decreased 1.1%. Michael identified the sales driver for the quarter. But let me reiterate that the primary reason for our comp sales decline was our decision to shift our marketing calendar from Q1 to Q2, resulting in shifted sales and lower advertising expenses for the quarter. During the quarter, we saw a 6% increase in AUR offset by a lower UPT and number of transactions.
The gross profit rate increased 100 basis points compared to last year's rate from continuing operations. The merchandize margin component increased 180 basis points, benefiting from the increase in AUR. The gross profit increase was partially offset by higher cost for buying, occupancy and e-commerce reflecting our strategic investment in omni-channel, technology and stores. Expense for the quarter decreased $2.4 million and leveraged 40 basis points to last year due to higher benefit from our private label credit card program, lower advertising cost that shifted to the second quarter, and lower store opening expense.
With regard to our private label credit card, we continue to see strong growth during the quarter with penetration rate increasing 350 basis points over last year's rate. The net loss for the quarter was $0.27 per share, $0.11 per share or 29% better than last year's loss from continuing operations of $0.38 per share. Our share count for the quarter was 31.75 million and the tax rate was 38.9%.
Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total merchandise inventories up 8% over last year. More than half of the increase was driven by supply-chain related in-transit inventory as we shipped second quarter merchandise earlier this year. We also had more cosmetic inventory, as this year we operated 63 more stores with Clinique and Estée Lauder counters. On a comp basis excluding cosmetics, inventory was up 0.7%. Borrowings under our credit facility at the end of the quarter were $86.6 million, essentially flat with last year.
Capital expenditure for the quarter, net of landlord construction allowances, totaled $12.2 million. We opened two new stores, completed one remodel and five expansions and installed cosmetic counters in one store. We also closed three stores during the quarter. As Michael noted, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for the year with comp sales between flat and up 2% and EPS between $1.20 and a $1.28.

That concludes my remarks. We would now be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question is from Heather Balsky of Bank of America. Your line is open.
Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. I guess my first question, you just broke out the details around inventory, but I was hoping you might be able to share what inventory looks like post-Mother's Day. And then, as a second question, can you just give us confidence – give color around your confidence about driving comp improvement for the remainder of the year? What kind of do you view as the key drivers, especially in 4Q? Thanks.
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Hi. This is Steve. I'll take a shot at answering both questions. From an inventory perspective, as Oded broke it down for you, we gave you comp store inventory of up 0.7%. So, we're trying to be transparent and let you know that's the inventory that's most comparable on a year-over-year basis. Beneath the surface, what I would tell you is that inventory is in very good shape. It's more forward-facing than a year ago. And quite honestly, it's probably in the best place it's been in the three years that I've been here. The delta between the 0.7% and the up 8% is, as Oded mentioned, a chunk of that's obviously cosmetics inventory as we continue to open more stores, which feeds the inventory base.
And then, there's a lot of in-transit in that. A lot of you guys know that port issues became an issue for us and for a lot of people in the back half of last year, in late third quarter, fourth quarter, and even bleeding into this year a little bit. So, we started looking at a key second quarter timing of Father's Day, back-to-school. We did open up some shipping windows with a couple of vendors and those goods did come in from an in-transit perspective. But when you look at the delta between the up 0.7% and the 8%, it's comprised primarily of cosmetics and in-transit, which really doesn't have any sort of a markdown or margin liability associated with it.
In terms of what gives us confidence, going forward, to drive comp, Michael alluded to a lot of the initiatives that we put in place. Really they haven't even started to take hold in the first quarter. We've got a lot of our store updates still ahead of us. As a matter of fact, most of them for the year are still happening, and we'll feel a lot of impact to that in third quarter, but primarily in fourth quarter. We continue to refine and update the assortment, and we're getting some really good wins there as we ramp up our penetration in updated and contemporary in Missi. So, we feel like a lot of the things that we put in place as part of the long range plan are still ahead of us this year and into the next couple of years.
Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Great. Thank you. And just one last follow-up, with regards to the headwinds you're seeing in your border stores, the reaction to the stronger dollar, have you seen trends worsen from the fourth quarter? How is that based into your guidance? Thanks.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Heather, it's Michael. I think it has actually gotten a little worse. So, I think as the dollar continues to get strong or frankly maybe said another way that weak peso as it continues to weaken, it has hurt us. There's no question about it. I mean, as you know, those stores are normally the ones that are always outperforming. And now they're actually a drag on our comp store sales at this point. And I don't know there's frankly a whole lot we can do down there at this point from that standpoint.
Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks again.

Operator
Your next question is from Pam Quintiliano with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, just a few quick ones for you. So, when we think about exposure to the energy states and the commentary on the border stores and performance, does that change the way you do buys going forward? Or just how you, yeah, how you think about your inventory positioning through the remainder of the year?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
I don't know if it changes how we buy. It changes how we allocate, obviously. So, if we see stores that are not trending up to where we planned or to where it were a year ago, we do shift inventory around. But we certainly have a financial plan that solves back to the guidance we've given and we do buy to that and allocate based off of the performance within the season and year.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
So, the guidance you're providing, what are you assuming about the health of your consumer in those energy states given it's so important for you guys?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
I think Michael addressed it in his comments. I mean, I think we see contrary information in the data, right? You look at it, and you say, Texas is the most impacted state. Within that, we have seen areas like Odessa and Midland where clearly, it's having an impact, but Houston also has a lot of energy-related business around it. It's the one of our best performing districts.
So, I think Michael alluded to the fact, if you ask any member of the management team, we probably all think that there's probably somewhat of a headwind there. It doesn't seem as great as it's been suggested. We feel like there's been other factors that impeded our progress in first quarter, some of which we created for ourselves like the marketing shifts, some of which were out of our control like weather. But I think we've got the appropriate caution built into our plan going forward based off of what we're seeing in the business right now.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
The other comment, Heather, that I would make – or Pam, that I would make, actually, is on those border stores is, even though those are some of our large volume stores or have been certainly in the past, again, it's only 26 out of over 800 stores. So, I wouldn't make more out of it than it is, but it's certainly from a dollar standpoint, or the strong dollar, it's certainly an issue.
To Steve's point about the energy thing, we've been looking at this. Obviously, a lot of people keep calling out the energy thing and how is it impacting us. And I think it bears repeating that despite what some other retailers I know have said, Houston continues to be one of our strong markets. So, I don't know if it's just our particular customer who isn't impacted by the energy in this particular market or what, but it continues. And granted we have a couple of our flagship stores here because it's our home, but it's been very strong here in Houston. You certainly wouldn't know about the energy issue here.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Okay. Well, that's great to hear. And then just one nudgy (0:19:55) follow-up on the energy question because I get it so often as well, what are you keeping the tightest eye on or where do you think the correlation, is it just – what do you think the strongest correlation I guess is when you look at the stores that are under performing in the energy states? Is it really that job data and related to losses with everything that's going on in that group or how do we think about that or is there a way to think about it?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer

I think we tried to call it out by highlighting Midland and Odessa. That's obviously one of the epicenters for drilling and fracking and as prices have come down in terms of price of barrel of oil, we've seen some impact there. So, that seems to be the biggest correlation for us right now.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Okay. Great, thank you. I know naïve question but I want to make sure there wasn't something else I was missing there. And then just on home, if we could delve into a little bit more and sorry if I missed this but specific, anything more on classifications that you're very excited about with home? Obviously, a big area of growth for you and anything exciting without revealing too much for competitive purposes that we should be thinking about for the back half of the year that you're doing differently?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
So, we relaunched home in third quarter and we spoke a lot about that in third quarter and how proud we were of the results. We stubbed our toe a little bit in the fourth quarter. We probably didn't have enough giftable merchandise going forward and a lot of the assortment was focused on more day-in, day-out purchases. Pleased to tell you, as we already mentioned, home was one of our strong businesses in the quarter.
So, we see that drafting into second quarter. What we've really been focusing on quite honestly for the back half of the year is really ratcheting up our gift offering within the home assortments that we can capitalize on holiday. And so, it's a little premature at this point to kind of reveal what we're doing there, but we feel like we've got some really good solutions in terms of giftable merchandise for fourth quarter.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
And they're back to looking for the everyday products for 1Q and you have the appropriate inventory for them?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Yeah, absolutely. And I think, Michael even called out we're so happy with the home business that we have rolled out our expanded home concept or are rolling it out right now to an additional 45 doors. So, that'll get us into about 100 doors that have kind of the larger mega-sized footprint in home for us.
Pamela Quintiliano - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey
Great. Thank you so much and best of luck.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks.
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Thanks.

Your next question is from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities. Your line is open.
Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions. First, can you give us the May comp and your month-to-date on May? And on Mother's Day, did you see a similar shift in terms of the performance of the comps that you were seeing in the border stores for the Mother's Day event or did it perform better?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
This is Steve. I'll take a shot at answering that. Obviously, this call is to talk about first quarter. We did kind of take the unusual step of giving you some visibility through 14 weeks, because quite honestly, Mother's Day is a pretty key point in the calendar, right? I mean, we look at kind of benchmarks throughout the year, after Easter, after Mother's Day, and unfortunately first quarter ends without the largest week of Mother's Day in it. So, we wanted to give you visibility into that. We're not going to share necessarily where we are month-to-date. Suffice it to say, as Michael said, it was a record Mother's Day for us. It moved us into the positive comp territory for the year, which is exciting. In terms of the border business, it was good. The first week, it did lag the company much as it has done throughout the first part of the year.

Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then, Oded, I'm not sure if you gave this, but you talked about a marketing shift in terms of the dollars. Can you give us the dollar number in terms of how much you shifted out of 1Q on the marketing side into 2Q?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
So, you have to look at it in its entirety because there was a sales shift and a margin shift and expense shift altogether. So, when you look at the total picture, the shift was not very significant.
Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Got it. Okay. And then just on the e-commerce side, how much of your offering is now online? And can you just talk a little bit about sort of fulfillment and delivery in terms of what you're achieving and improvements that you expect from the new SVP that you hired?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Sure. So, we're at a point right now where virtually 100% of our store assortment is available online. We have been ramping up, obviously, the exclusive piece of the assortment to offer an expanded assortment online with the idea being most of our stores are around 18,000 square feet on average. What if we had a 200,000-square-foot store, what would that look like? And that's kind of the guiding principle the teams are using as they're constructing assortments going forward. From a fulfillment perspective, we continue to invest in moving some goods to the distribution center to increase our fulfillment from the D.C. We're north of 40% for first quarter, so we're climbing with our goal to get into that 70% to 80% range as we get closer to holiday. We're right on track to do that.
In terms of our new head of e-commerce, really excited to have Mike aboard. He brings a lot of deep knowledge in this category. And it's premature to say exactly what all the changes he's going to bring about are. He's only been on the job about two weeks, but he's been here digging in, really getting to know the team, understand the strategy. And probably in the next call, we'll be able to give you a little more color in terms of some of the impacts he's had on the business. But I could tell you he's come in and really hit the ground running, and everybody's excited to have him here.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Bob. It's Michael. That was a good try trying to get us to talk about the second quarter.
Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
I have one more question, Michael. I think one of the categories you caught out that was weaker was denim. Can you just talk a little bit about the trends going on there, sort of are you heavy in denim in terms of is there inventory exposure there, sort of how we should think about it going forward?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm going to let Steve talk about it. But I tell you from my perspective, it was weak certainly in the first quarter. The crazy thing is as you probably know, we keep hearing from all the manufacturers, all the vendors that it's really going to pick up in the second half of the year. And I'll let Steve comment. But you keep hearing that, but frankly, we haven't seen it very much.
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
So from an exposure perspective, we're not exposed on denim. We obviously shifted a chunk of the buy-in to the active athletic bottoms and that continues to do very well as Michael alluded to. He's also correct in telling you, we haven't really seen a pickup in first quarter in denim. All the vendors are telling us that they're seeing it out there amongst other accounts. And for us, long denim becomes a lot less important in the second quarter than maybe it does for other people. But what we have done is in the denim-centric categories particularly the back-to-school categories taking a good stand in denim, young men's, juniors, kids. So, we're going to be in good shape in denim heading into back-to-school and we'll be positioned to take advantage of a resurgent denim business should it happen.

Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.
Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT
Hey. Good morning, guys. I know you're confirming the full year guidance. But I know there's always a lot of moving parts inter-quarter. And I just want to know if you guys want to use this opportunity to see if there's anything between quarters timing shifts that you wanted us to think about from a modeling cadence throughout the balance of the year?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
So not really. We don't like to talk about the quarters beyond the quarter that just happened. We still think the same way about the year from all of its components. No significant change. No.
Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay, great. And then just on depreciation expense was up about 50 basis points year-over-year. And even though you guys had nice leverage in SG&A, that was obviously a headwind. I assume that some of the technology depreciating more quickly. Is that a good run rate for the balance of the year, or was there some timing in the first quarter?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
No. I think that's a good run rate for the year.
Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. And then, just on some of the sales drivers and I think the one that's got everybody excited is the 100 new stores that you're going to touch this year. Can you just delve into what that includes, what you think the comp lift could be? And again, just remind us the timing of that when those will be completed.
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Sure. This is Steve. I'll take a shot at answering that. Not to be evasive, it's hard to assign a comp number. What we've done is we went out, did a ton of research with customers and got their feedback in terms of what they wanted or were looking for from a friendly-shopping environment. We came up with a list of 12 different factors, as Michael kind of listed off some of them. It could be lighting, it could be tiles, it could be carpeting, could be new fixtures, could be mannequins, could be fitting rooms. And we've gone through and triaged our stores and said, okay, within some of these stores, what needs to be done.
In some cases, it maybe only one or two of those items. So, for example, you've been in our Meyerland store. That store was pretty close to being where we'd like it to be. We needed to do a little work on lighting and fitting rooms. In that case, we're probably not going to see a huge comp lift off of just changing the lighting a little bit or updating the fitting rooms, although it's something we needed to do so we can live up to our customers' expectation.
Other stores we're doing more comprehensive remods, and we're touching maybe 9 or 10 of those factors, we're going to see a bigger lift off of, and we feel like they're going to give us a real tailwind. So, it's hard to give you a total because there are so moving parts on a store-to-store basis that it's impossible to assign a comp to what the impact of that is going to be. In terms of timing, we're getting a handful of those stores done right now. As Michael said, we'll have even more stores done as we get into third quarter. We should be done as we get out of third quarter heading into fourth quarter and that's where we're going to see our biggest impact from new stores.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Clearly the lift, Chuck, will come in the fourth quarter. I mean we're up against as you know a pretty difficult fourth quarter from a sales standpoint and I think that's where we'll see the results of the refixturing if you will.
Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT

And when you take a step back, the comps decline of down 1%. And I know you don't give quarterly cadence, but how much was that delta relative to your expectations? How do you feel about the consumer when you take a big picture look at what's going on and all the puts and takes impacting your consumer?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'm not going to say the specific number to you other than to say that you know our expectations and we're certainly focused on top line and there were just an awful lot of things that happened in the first quarter. I mean the good news is it was first quarter and we got the rest of the year ahead of us and as we said for Mother's Day, we feel it was just – I can't tell you how spectacular that week was. I mean, you obviously see how much it moved the needle for us and it'd created some nice momentum and so we'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but, yes, it was disappointing in the first quarter on the top line basis.
Charles P. Grom - Sterne Agee CRT
Okay. All right, guys. Good luck. Thanks.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks.

Your next question is from David Mann with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing amongst the competitors? How would you characterize the promotional environment?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
This is Steve. I'll take a shot at answering that. I mean it's a question I think that comes up each quarter and I think our answer is always the same. It's competitive out there, right. I don't think that that lets up. I mean, we do see competitive intensity increase when you get around the natural selling peaks. But certainly, for Mother's Day, it was a competitive Mother's Day. We feel like we were obviously appropriately competitively priced.
I will say that a lot of people have revealed what their first quarter comps are, and you know it was not an easy quarter for a lot of people out there. You did see as we got to the tail end of the quarter, people being a little more aggressive, extending events or adding events in to try to move their comp as we got closer to the end of the quarter. But I would say for the most part around the peaks, it has been competitive and will always be competitive.
David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
One of your competitors is for sale right now. I'm just curious, do you have any interest – have you looked at their store base? Any interest in any of their stores that might fit well into your network?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
David, I'm certainly not going to comment on any M&A-type activity. But we're all as opportunistic. We've talked about in the past the fact that we have competitors in some of our markets and if they were ever made available, we certainly would have potentially some interest. It's always nice to have less competition.
David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
And then in terms of e-commerce, I think the growth rate that you called out for the first quarter was somewhat similar to the rate that you generated last year. How do you think about how e-commerce will perform over the rest of the year and when might we see some acceleration in that growth rate given the initiatives you have in place?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
So, what I would tell you is one of our stated goals was to get to north of 3% penetration this year on an annualized basis. We're on track to deliver that right now. We are excited to have Mike aboard. And not to put any pressure on him, but I'm counting on him to accelerate it once he gets his feet under him, he can really tear apart the strategy and put his own spin on it. So, we're going to put a lot of pressure on him to accelerate it.

David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Would that suggest probably more in the second half than in the second quarter?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
Considering that he just started two weeks ago, his impact is probably not going to be felt till the earliest third, if not fourth quarter.
David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. And then one last sort of quick question. You talked about a reissue of the credit card. Can you just elaborate what might that entail, and I think in the past when you've reissued you had a nice lift, should we expect similar results with this reissue?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
You usually get a nice lift when you reissued the credit cards. The last time we've done that was in 2012 and it's time to refresh the file and issue a new card. So, yes we expect to see a lift.
David M. Mann - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question is from Jeff Van Sinderen with B. Riley & Co. Your line is open.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Good morning. Maybe you could just follow up a little bit on gross margin. I'm just wondering if there is anything we should think about relevant to gross margin in Q2. Is there anything in terms of a port hangover? Do you feel like we're through that issue at this point, and then any timing shifts we should know about just related to Q2?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
The first quarter merchandise margin improved by 180 basis points as we said, and our guidance for the year hasn't changed. You're still going to see a little bit of merchandise margin increase, mostly stemming from Q1. So, for the rest of the year you can assume that merchandise margin is going to be pretty flat. So, no hangovers, no issues. Just the cadence of the business
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. That's helpful. And then in terms of the – I know you spoke to some of the various markets with comps in the border stores and Houston and so forth. But I'm just wondering if you looked at the smaller versus larger markets and then maybe even how the JCPenney-only markets were in terms of competition, anything to call out there?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Actually, Jeff, again, we've been saying this actually for a couple quarters now. It's pretty consistent. There's no specific – if you look around the country, as you know, we're in 40 different states, and it's remarkable how consistent it is. Again, within Texas, there were certain issues, as we talked about, the Odessa/Midland or the border, but then Houston offset it. But literally, in terms of the rest of the country, the small stores versus large stores, the JCPenney's markets, whatever other markets, our performance is pretty consistent, and you're talking about just a couple basis points one way or another, nothing significant.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. And then can you also just touch on your comps in cosmetics and then is that something that you see continuing to be a driver as you continue to roll out counters the rest of the year? And then maybe also if you can just touch on the spring marketing, some of the changes you made this year in terms of personalization, any metrics you can share there to gauge success so far. Thanks.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. I'll let Steve handle some of the personalization and some of those items. In terms of the cosmetics, listen, you know we've had a terrific track record these last few years, these last few quarters with cosmetics as we continue to roll out the Estée Lauder and Clinique counters. I see no reason for that to change.
As we said earlier, we're going to do about 30 more counters or 30 more stores, actually, with Estée Lauder and Clinique, going to do an additional 20 stores with Smashbox and Origins. I mean that tends to be a real winner for us and there's certainly no sign of that changing. So, I feel really good about that. We're testing in some of our smaller stores. I know the question often comes up how many stores can you continue to roll Estée Lauder and Clinique out to? And every time we give you a number, we seem to be able to exceed it the next couple, the next year or whatever.

Right now we're testing some smaller counters, frankly, that work well, hopefully, in some of our smaller stores which enable us to continue on that path. But we'll see. But so far so good, and feel great about where we are with cosmetics.
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
In terms of personalization, obviously, a hot topic out there in retail right now. We definitely are looking at ways to continue to reach out to our customer, speak to them on a more one-on-one basis. Some examples of that, for Mother's Day, we actually did a couple different versions. One version went out to only our plus-size customers versus another version went out to more traditional, missy (0:38:25) customers.
We try to personalize emails and texts based off shopping patterns that are out there. We're doing some personalization in terms of direct mail where we're changing it up based off of whether you're a men-centric customer, a home customer, kids customer, et cetera. So, definitely something we're focused on and working on. We're in the early innings on that. It's not like we've got a huge run rate on this so far. But so far really pleased with the results and something we're going to continue to do more and more of.
Jeff Van Sinderen - B. Riley & Co. LLC
Okay. Good to hear. Thanks very much and good luck.

Your next question is from David Glick with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Thank you. Just a couple quick questions. Your new SVP of e-commerce, you listed a number of companies with relevant experience. Just curious where he came from most recently.
And then secondly, it sounds like men's and accessories, a little tougher. Those are typically – have been strong businesses for you, if I'm not mistaken. Curious what the strategies are to turn that around.
And then third, just some commentary on footwear, which we've been hearing from other companies has been improving and the potential for a strong footwear and resurgent denim business, what that might mean for back-to-school? Thanks.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hi, David. Michael. First of all, let me just start with Mike Smith for a second. Most recently he was at Signet, which is I know you're familiar with. The beauty of him coming from Signet, frankly, is that he's used to dealing with multiple nameplates.
So, as you know, Signet I guess has Jared and Kay and Zales and various nameplates, so he's dealt with that issue that obviously we have at times struggled with. And so, that's just one positive why we're happy to have him with us and we think he'll make a big impact here.
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
In terms of the businesses you asked about, specifically the men's business, probably our biggest drag there quite honestly has just been our inability at least in the first quarter to sell seasonal products. With some of the weather we experienced, seasonals really were late in opening up. The good news is once we did get into that Mother's Day shift, we did see not only within the women's business the seasonals across all the categories open up.
And speaking a little bit to the marketing shift that we did for Mother's Day, one of the things that we have noticed is that the timing on these events, at least from a brick-and-mortar perspective, seems to be compressing. We used to look at Mother's Day, Father's Day, Easter as two-week events. It seems like more and more, at least from a brick-and-mortar perspective, they're compressing down into a 7-day to 10-day event, which is one of the reasons why we purposely made the shift we did for Mother's Day to move marketing out from two weeks out into the week out and that paid off for us. So, we think that that obviously would work as well for Father's Day.

In terms of accessories, most of the categories within accessories have been pretty solid. Handbag business good; costume jewelry business good. We did have a little softness in fine jewelry. We did see it come back a little bit for Mother's Day. We're very bullish about our handbag business going forward in the second quarter. We're also excited to see some of our seasonal categories there open up like sun. So we think that's already on the road to recovery.
You mentioned shoes. Shoes has been one of our strongest businesses. It was our strongest business last year in the total company, and it was one of our weaker businesses in first quarter. So, when we talk about port issues, I've characterized it as more of an annoyance than a hardcore problem. A few of the shoe buyer, the shoe DMM, they're going to tell you it's more of a problem and that was the area that was probably most impacted by the port strike and slowdowns in deliveries because so much of that does come from China and it comes through the West Coast. We're back in good inventory position in shoes. Shoes, like a lot of the businesses, had a really, really good Mother's Day. We saw the seasonal businesses open up there like sandals and we feel really good about our Father's Day, and really our back-to-school business in shoes. So, we feel like shoes is going to be a tailwind for us the rest of the year.

Your next question is from Jeff Stein with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
A couple questions. First for Oded. Oded, it seems to me that with your guidance and based on what you did in the first quarter, you're essentially telling us that you're going to be flat at the high-end and down at the low-end of the range over the balance of the year, and I just got to make sure I understand if that in fact is kind of what you're expecting.
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
So, Jeff, as we said, throughout the year, we believe that this guidance is conservative. We want to make sure that we can accomplish what we set out to do and what we have guided the Street, right? So, I would mention that, again, we are pleased with the first quarter results. We didn't see any significant material reason to change our guidance at this point.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. You mentioned credit penetration improved 350 basis points. Exactly, where were you at the end of the quarter compared to prior year and how much increase did you see in your credit income in the first quarter?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
So, we were north of 40% in penetration. We're consistently seeing quarters over 40%. Again, very excited about that because it's so important with our communication with the customer, increasing loyalty, of course, helping sales and the bottom line. I don't want to get into too much of the income, but certainly the income or the benefits from the credit card program increased nicely in the first quarter.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And when you relaunched your credit card in the fourth quarter, are there going to be any enhancements to the loyalty program or special incentives to come out and use the new card immediately? I think you did that in 2012.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Jeff, for sure. I mean, that's something we're going to take advantage of the opportunity of the reissue, obviously, to more than just send out a card, but obviously do some things from a value proposition standpoint that we think will be meaningful and significant, and hopefully certainly not only drive the use of the card but hopefully help our top line as well.

Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
And, Jeff, as you know, we are constantly thinking and improving our loyalty programs. And over the course of the year, we plan to test a number of different loyalty permutations and see what works best for our customers. So, you've got to think about relaunching the card and also expanding the loyalty program.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
How many cards do you plan on sending out and how would that compare to 2012?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
It's over 2 million cards. Our program is constantly growing. I don't know the exact growth rate. We can get back to you with that.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And just trying to isolate the weather impact. Can you parse out how your comps trended in February compared to March, April on a combined basis?
Steven Paul Lawrence - Chief Merchandising Officer
So, this is Steve. I'll take a shot at that. We had a lot of momentum coming out of fourth quarter, and we saw that continue into the first part of February. I will tell you that in the back half of February in our geography, a lot of ice storms, closures of stores, and it's like hit the brakes and gave back a lot of what we gained, obviously, in the first half of the month. Once we got past February, I would say it was less about ice and snow. It was more about not warm temperatures, but really rain in our geography. I joke with Michael every day, it's raining down here. I think I'm building an ark in my backyard. So, that's impacted our ability to sell seasonals primarily. But certainly, the biggest impact from a store closure and from a ice and temperature was felt in February.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
So, Steve, would it be fair, I mean, was February down mid-single digit or not that much?
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Jeff, we're not going to give specific months other than to say the month of February was down for us, and obviously impacted by the weather, as Steve pointed out. The other thing to say on the weather thing is even where we didn't have the stores shut down and all the issues with the roads and so forth, when you get into Easter there, as you know, it really comes down to not – people always keep talking about the timing of Easter and is it too early or is it too late, but it really comes down to what those weather conditions are and whether you're going to start selling some of the seasonal spring-type goods. And obviously, this year that was also kind of difficult.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay. And just final question. With respect to store closings, is the number still 10 to 20 for the year?
Oded Shein - CFO, Secretary, Treasurer & Executive VP
That is correct.
Jeff S. Stein - Northcoast Research Partners LLC
Okay, great. Okay, guys. Thanks a lot.
Michael L. Glazer - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
