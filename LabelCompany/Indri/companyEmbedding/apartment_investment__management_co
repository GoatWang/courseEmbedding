Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.

For in-depth information about how Optimal Product Management can help your company, contact us.

Apartment Investment & Management Becomes #226 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Ralph Lauren
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 05/31/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Aimco or Apartment Investment Management Company is one of the largest owners and operators of apartment communities in the United States. The company is headquartered in Denver, Colorado.
The company owns or has investments in 196 communities serving 250,000 residents in 22 states and the District of Columbia.[1]
Aimco’s key markets include Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, South Florida, Atlanta, Chicago, Suburban New York/New Jersey, San Jose, Orange County, California, Manhattan, Denver, East Bay, San Diego, Phoenix, Washington/Northern Virginia/Maryland, San Francisco and Boston.
Aimco’s business model focuses on the redevelopment of older, market-rate apartment communities in premiere locations.

History[edit]
Aimco was founded by Terry Considine, who currently serves as Chairman and CEO.[3]
Aimco went public via an initial public offering in 1994.[3]
Aimco was first included in the S&P 500 in 2003.
Acquisitions[edit]
In 1994 Aimco acquired Homecorp, a management company with 5,300 units based in Montgomery, Alabama.[3]
In 1996 Aimco acquired Walters Management Company, based in San Diego, California.[4]
Aimco also acquired the J.W. English Company in Houston, Texas. Aimco also purchased a portion of the general partnership of Balcor Asset Management resulting in the addition of 67 properties in three states.
In October 1997, Aimco acquired 8,175 apartment units from Winthrop.[5]
In May of that year, Aimco acquired National Housing Partnership Incorporated, then the country’s second largest management company, headquartered in Vienna, Virginia. The NHP acquisition added 534 conventional and affordable properties with 87,659 apartments to Aimco. NHP is a Congressionally chartered affordable housing company.
In 1998, Aimco acquired Insignia in a $910 million transaction. The company then owned or managed 391,891 apartment units in 2,163 apartment communities.[6]
In 2002, Aimco acquired Casden Properties, founded by Alan Casden. The $1.5 billion acquisition included 17,383 apartments, including 6,356 conventional apartment units located in Southern California and 11,027 affordable apartment units in 25 states.[7]
Corporate Culture[edit]
In 2013, Aimco released its Values and Culture Guide,[8] detailing the ways the company's core values influence the culture at Aimco, including "owning it," valuing relationships and living with gusto. In addition, Aimco was named one of the Denver Post's Top Workplaces in Colorado in 2013, 2014 and 2015.[9][10]
Management[edit]

CEO: Terry Considine
EVP, General Counsel and Secretary: Lisa R. Cohn
EVP and Chief Administrative Officer: Miles Cortez
EVP - Securities and Debt; Treasurer: Patti K. Fielding
EVP and Chief Financial Officer: Ernest M. Freedman
EVP - Property Operations: Keith M. Kimmel
EVP and Chief Investment Officer: John E. Bezzant

Philanthropy[edit]
Aimco Cares, which was started in 2004, encourages each team member to spend ten Aimco-paid hours a year to volunteer in meaningful activities. In 2014 Aimco team members volunteered thousands of hours giving back to community organization and causes; 145 events in total.
To help meet the needs of the military and their families, Aimco has raised more than $2.93 million from participants and sponsors at the Aimco Cares Charity Golf Classic (nearly $400,000 in 2014 alone!) and distributed the funds to worthy non-profit organizations - Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors, which provides support services to families of fallen soldiers; Project Sanctuary, which offers family retreats that offer a constructive and unique way for our nation's heroes to reconnect with loved ones and readjust to life at home and the National Leased Housing Association, which in partnership with Aimco, provides college scholarships to students living in affordable housing.
Aimco also has a number of philanthropic programs geared towards aiding its employees and their families; Including education reimbursement for its team members, college scholarships for its team members’ children (Aimco has given out 491 college scholarships since 2006), and its Employee Assistance Program (which provides counseling and network of referral services for team members with challenging personal issues). Aimco’s Aimco CARES 4U program also provides short-term funds to help colleagues weather tough times and get back on their feet.
Environmental initiatives[edit]
According to page 13 of the company's 2014 Corporate Citizenship Report, the company has introduced lighting, HVAC, and irrigation systems that have positive environmental and economic impacts.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
