INVESTMENT BANKING 

Elevating the experience  


 






Our sell-side advisory services support middle-market business owners as they evaluate a sale of their business or assets to private equity or strategic acquirers. We are experts in preparing and positioning companies for this process, often resulting in closing prices above initial projections. With each sell-side assignment, we spend a substantial amount of time upfront analyzing our client’s business. Through this work, we gain intimate knowledge that allows us optimally to position the business for sale and with the goal of exceeding our clients’ expectations.
Our services include evaluating and recommending financial and strategic alternatives with respect to a sale, advising on the appropriate process, valuation, and timing, and preparing collateral materials. Bruderman also assists with alternative liquidation strategies, including leveraged and unleveraged ESOP plans. Most importantly, we collaborate with our clients to identify, contact, and select the most qualified buyers while also assisting in negotiating and closing the sale.

History



A Legacy of Success

			Our family's investment management business has origins dating to the late 1800's, and for three 
			generations we have advised wealthy European investors, charitable and religious organizations, 
			and several royal families.
			

			Following nearly 100 years of advising wealthy and influential families, the logical progression 
			for our business was to provide investment banking services to the businesses owned by our 
			investment management clients.  Accordingly, in 1999, Bruderman Brothers was formed as a 
			broker-dealer registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
			

			Today, Bruderman Brothers specializes in providing investment banking services to closely-held 
			companies and family businesses.

Privacy Policy

			This privacy policy (the "Policy") applies only to information collected at this Web site. 
			It does not apply to information collected by us, or on our behalf, in person, through the 
			mail, by telephone or any other means. This policy is effective as of January 1, 2010.
			

			By using our Site, you consent to the terms of our Policy and to our use of your Personal 
			Information (as hereinafter defined).
			

			Introduction & Personal Information
			

			BB and its affiliated companies ("we, us") respect your online privacy and recognize your 
			need for appropriate protection and management of your personally identifiable information 
			("Personal Information") that we may acquire in your use of our Site. We may collect Personal 
			Information from you; if we do, you will be expressly asked for it so that you know what 
			information you are providing. We also collect non-Personal Information, described below.
			

			Non-Personal Information
			

			We may use reporting technologies on our Site to record non-personal information such as 
			internet domain and host names; internet protocol (IP) addresses; the page you request, your 
			browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that 
			our Site is accessed. We analyze this information for trends and statistics. Our use of 
			tracking technologies allows us to improve our Site, helps us understand the demographics of 
			our user base, and suggests the sorts of announcements you are likely to have an interest in.
			

			Our Site may utilize "cookies." A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your computer's 
			hard drive that allows our Site to recognize you as a prior user, determine which pages you 
			have previously seen, and so on. We also may use cookies to deliver content to you that you 
			might be particularly interested in. We cannot determine your identity from our use of cookies. 
			We may store the information collected through cookies in our databases. You may be able to 
			configure your browser to notify you if you receive a cookie, to block cookies, or to remove 
			cookies from your computer. However if you do so, it may be more difficult for you to navigate 
			our Site.
			

			These technologies are not designed to identify you. It may be possible to identify you and 
			your online actions through the use of cookies and IP addresses, but only in conjunction with 
			Personal Information you have voluntarily provided to us.
			

			Protection of Personal Information
			

			We restrict access to the Personal Information we have collected from or about you, as 
			described above, to those employees who need to know the information to provide services to you. 
			We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to guard your Personal Information.
			

			Despite our use of commercially reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information from 
			unauthorized access or disclosure, the internet is not an inherently secure environment and 
			so we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information. We assume no liability for 
			any disclosure of data due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third party access or other 
			acts of third parties, or acts or omissions beyond our reasonable control.
			

			Use of Personal Information
			

			We may collect Personal Information when you sign up to receive newsletters that we may publish 
			from time to time, request information regarding an event we may sponsor, and otherwise as needed 
			to fulfill your requests for information and services, and to contact you. When we collect this 
			information, you will know it because you will need to submit this information to us in order to 
			receive the information or service you requested. We use Personal Information primarily for our 
			own internal purposes, such as evaluating what aspects of the Site need improvement, fulfilling 
			your requests for information or services, and communicating with you.
			

			We also use Personal Information for our direct marketing purposes, and we will use the 
			information to send you announcements and invitations in which we think you may have interest. 
			You can always opt out of these marketing uses by telling us not to send the materials to you 
			when you provide the Personal Information, or by asking us to remove you from those mailing lists. 
			This is normally done by clicking on the appropriate link in those mailings. You can also contact 
			us at info@brudermanbrothers.com. We cannot delete all the Personal Information that you provide 
			to us, even if you ask us to do so.
			

			If you choose not to provide us with the Personal Information that we request, you can still 
			visit most of our Site, but you may be unable to obtain certain information or services that 
			we offer. 
			

			Disclosure of Personal Information
			

			In the ordinary course of our business, we do not rent or sell any Personal Information we 
			collect from or about you. For the purposes specified above, we may transfer or disclose 
			any Personal Information we have collected from or about you to any of our affiliated entities.
			

			We may disclose your Personal Information as permitted by law and may also be required to 
			disclose your Personal Information to governmental or regulatory entities in response to 
			regulatory inquiries in connection with investigations or to comply with applicable law, 
			rules, regulations, orders subpoenas, or other legal processes.
			

			We may disclose all of the information we collect from or about you, including Personal 
			Information, as described above, to companies that perform marketing services on our 
			behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 
			These third-party service providers help us maintain our Site and deliver information and 
			services to you and other users of our Site, and help us analyze our Site traffic. 
			The companies we hire to provide such support services are not allowed to use your Personal 
			Information for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to protect your Personal 
			Information.
			

			We do not transfer Personal Information to third parties for their use as a mailing list or 
			for other advertising purposes. As an exception, your Personal Information may be used by 
			any company with which we merge, acquire or are acquired by; we may also use it in the event 
			of bankruptcy. In the event our Privacy Policy is modified due to such merger, acquisition, 
			bankruptcy, or for any other reason, notice of the revised Privacy Policy will be posted on 
			this Site. 
			

			Access, Accuracy and Deletion of Data
			

			Upon your written request, we will allow you to review any of your Personal Information that 
			you disclosed to us, except for any Personal Information that we collect in connection with 
			or in anticipation of any claim or legal proceeding. If you discover any inaccuracy, please 
			let us know so that we can make whatever corrections are appropriate.
			

			We keep Personal Information for an unlimited time period. However you can ask us to delete 
			your Personal Information from our marketing databases, and if you do that we will comply as 
			soon as practicable. If you would like to submit revisions to your Personal Information, 
			please send them via e-mail to info@brudermanbrothers.com.
			

			Children
			

			Our Web site is not designed for children, and we do not seek to collect any information 
			from children including those under the age of 13.
			

			Third Party Web Sites
			

			You may be able to access third-party web sites directly from our Site. We cannot 
			control how third parties may use Personal Information you disclose to them, so you should 
			carefully review the privacy policy of any third-party web site you visit before using it or 
			disclosing your Personal Information to it.
			

			Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and our Site is constantly evolving to 
			meet these demands. We therefore reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, and it 
			is your responsibility to review this Policy.  For your convenience, each time we modify this 
			Policy, we indicate in the first paragraph of the Policy the date on which said modifications 
			have been made.  Your continued use of our Site following modification to this Policy will 
			constitute your acceptance of those modifications.

Emerging Markets at the Crossroads
A radical shift in the forces shaping emerging market (EM) growth will require investors to take a different investment approach from what may have worked in the past. Increasingly, discovering EM investment opportunities will be rooted in the ability to capture the alpha from the new growth drivers, rather than in chasing the beta of the broad EM universe.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
