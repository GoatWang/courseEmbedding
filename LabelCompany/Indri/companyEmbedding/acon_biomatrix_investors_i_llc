Product Description

Natural Support for Your Endocrine System
DHEA Drops from BioMatrix provides a convenient, easily absorbed, sublingual source of this versatile natural hormone.
Extracted from wild yam (dioscorea villosa), this dietary supplement may help support your endocrine system, or glands that release hormones that regulate your body's physiological functions. It may also support metabolism, immunity, energy levels and mood.
What is DHEA?
DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that serves as a precursor to androgens and estrogens, which help regulate many functions in the body, including metabolism, reproductive health and energy levels. 
Its production typically peaks before your turn 30, after which it declines.
What is wild yam?
These DHEA drops are formulated from an extraction of wild yam, a perennial vine native to North America.
Health practitioners have long used its tubers or fleshy roots, which contain steroid sapogenins, from which a substance called diosgenin is derived. Diosgenin is the plant-derived form of DHEA.
DHEA drops for Optimal Absorption
BioMatrix DHEA drops are used sublingually for quick and optimal absorption, thus bypassing the gut where malabsorption and oxidation may occur. 
Suggested Use for DHEA Drops
To use as a dietary supplement, you can take 2 drops, three times a day, or as instructed by a healthcare professional.
Get quality, natural DHEA. Order today!

Product Description

Natural Support for Your Endocrine System
DHEA Drops from BioMatrix provides a convenient, easily absorbed, sublingual source of this versatile natural hormone.
Extracted from wild yam (dioscorea villosa), this dietary supplement may help support your endocrine system, or glands that release hormones that regulate your body's physiological functions. It may also support metabolism, immunity, energy levels and mood.
What is DHEA?
DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that serves as a precursor to androgens and estrogens, which help regulate many functions in the body, including metabolism, reproductive health and energy levels. 
Its production typically peaks before your turn 30, after which it declines.
What is wild yam?
These DHEA drops are formulated from an extraction of wild yam, a perennial vine native to North America.
Health practitioners have long used its tubers or fleshy roots, which contain steroid sapogenins, from which a substance called diosgenin is derived. Diosgenin is the plant-derived form of DHEA.
DHEA drops for Optimal Absorption
BioMatrix DHEA drops are used sublingually for quick and optimal absorption, thus bypassing the gut where malabsorption and oxidation may occur. 
Suggested Use for DHEA Drops
To use as a dietary supplement, you can take 2 drops, three times a day, or as instructed by a healthcare professional.
Get quality, natural DHEA. Order today!
