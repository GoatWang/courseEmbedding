Overview

Partnership Request Form






Bojangles’ currently has restaurants in 12 states, as well as an international location in Honduras, and each of them has something in common—a deep appreciation for the communities we serve. That’s why, in addition to providing great food at good prices, Bojangles’ is committed to helping the individuals who reside in those communities whenever we can.
To date, we’ve partnered with dozens of charitable organizations ranging from Toys for Tots and the Red Cross to MDA and Special Olympics, each of them providing critical services and support to individuals in need. In fact, we’ve raised over $609,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association through sales of shamrocks at our stores alone.
We’ve also been proud to provide troops returning home to our communities with a welcome breakfast through Project Exodus, and we’re always looking for additional ways to help support the communities who have supported us for so many years.





Bo loves to share!
Looking for a tasty way to raise funds for your club, school or team? Try a Bojangles’ Share Night. Invite as many group members, parents, family friends, community members or complete strangers as you like. No matter who shows up, we’ll donate a percentage of sales from your Share Night back to your organization. Sounds popular, and profitable, doesn’t it?

This employer will provide the Social Security Administration (SSA) and, if necessary, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with information from each new employee’s Form I-9 to confirm work authorization.
IMPORTANT: If the Government cannot confirm that you are authorized to work, this employer is required to provide you written instructions and an opportunity to contact SSA and/or DHS before taking adverse action against you, including terminating your employment.
Employers may not use E-Verify to pre-screen job applicants or to re-verify current employees and may not limit or influence the choice of documents presented for use on the Form I-9.
In order to determine whether Form I-9 documentation is valid, this employer uses E-Verify’s photo screening tool to match the photograph appearing on some permanent resident and employment authorization cards with the official U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) photograph.
If you believe that your employer has violated its responsibilities under this program or has discriminated against you during the verification process based upon your national origin or citizenship status, please call the Office of Special Counsel at 1-800-255-7688 (TDD: 1-800-237-2515).


Este empleador le proporcionará a la Administración del Seguro Social (SSA), y si es necesario, al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS), información obtenida del Formulario I-9 correspondiente a cada empleado recién contratado con el propósito de confirmar la autorización de trabajo.
IMPORTANTE: En dado caso que el gobierno no pueda confirmar si está usted autorizado para trabajar, este empleador está obligado a proporcionarle las instrucciones por escrito y darle la oportunidad a que se ponga en contacto con la oficina del SSA y, o el DHS antes de tomar una determinación adversa en contra suya, inclusive despedirlo.
Los empleadores no pueden utilizar E-Verify con el propósito de realizar una preselección de aspirantes a empleo o para hacer nuevas verificaciones de los empleados actuales, y no deben restringir o influenciar la selección de los documentos que sean presentados para ser utilizados en el Formulario I-9.
A fin de poder determinar si la documentación del Formulario I-9 es valida o no, este empleador utiliza la herramienta de selección fotográfica de E-Verify para comparar la fotografía que aparece en algunas de las tarjetas de residente y autorizaciones de empleo, con las fotografías oficiales del Servicio de Inmigración y Ciudadanía de los Estados Unidos (USCIS).
Si usted cree que su empleador ha violado sus responsabilidades bajo este programa, o ha discriminado en contra suya durante el proceso de verificación debido a su lugar de origen o condición de ciudadanía, favor ponerse en contacto con la Oficina de Asesoría Especial llamando al 1-800-255-7688 (TDD: 1-800-237-2515).

 ABOUT BOJANGLES’® Bojangles’® began in 1977 as the dream of operators Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas. They saw an opportunity to develop a quick-service restaurant chain based on three attributes: a distinctive flavor profile; wholesome, high-quality products made from scratch; and a fun, festive restaurant design with fast, friendly service.    Bojangles’® core menu is the same now as it was then: distinctive, flavorful chicken made with a special blend of seasonings and served with hot, fresh buttermilk biscuits and one-of-a-kind fixin’s like Bojangles’ Dirty Rice® and Bojangles’ Cajun Pintos®. Bojangles’® light, buttery, made-from-scratch biscuits serve as the basis for the best breakfast in the industry. From biscuit sandwiches filled with mouthwatering items like spicy chicken filets, seasoned sausage or steak, country ham, eggs and cheese, to sweet biscuits like our Cinnamon Pecan Twists and Bo-Berry Biscuits®, no one does breakfast like Bojangles’®. That’s why Bojangles’® serves breakfast all day, every day.    Over the years, Bojangles’® has added a few new items - such as Chicken Supremes™ - in response to customers’ craving for a boneless version of Bojangles’® one-of-a-kind chicken. Each new idea has been extensively tested to make sure it aligns with the Bojangles’® concept and meets our high standards for quality and taste. The entire Bojangles’® organization is committed to ensuring that our guests always get the best-tasting, highest-quality products possible, served quickly by friendly people in a clean and pleasant environment. If customer research and sales are any indication, our continued success proves that people appreciate the Bojangles’® difference. Thank you for your interest in our brand.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

			Our Company
		






			Our Company: Tands, Inc. & Bojangles®
		

			Bojangles’® began in 1977 as the dream of operators Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas. They saw an opportunity to develop a quick-service restaurant chain based on three attributes: distinctive flavor profile; wholesome, high-quality products made from scratch; and a fun, festive restaurant design with fast, friendly service. Tands, Inc. joined the Bojangles'® team in 1980 and has been committed to those same high standards.
		

			More than 30 years later, that hasn’t changed — and neither have the recipes our founders Jack Fulk and Richard Thomas came up with. They’ve just spread to the rest of the country. Bojangles’® is now preparing to open its 500th restaurant. There are now Bojangles’® in two international locations, 10 states and Washington, DC. See the Bojangles'® website for more information on their corporate business and history.
		

			Tands, Inc. is proud to be a part of the Eastern North Carolina and Richmond, VA communities. We support our community through special events like Kids' and Family Nights, and bingo at select locations.
