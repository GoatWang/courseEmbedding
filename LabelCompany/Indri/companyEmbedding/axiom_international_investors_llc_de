Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.


The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin. Customers should therefore carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for them in light of their financial condition, risk tolerance and understanding of foreign markets. These risks include foreign currency risk and liquidation risk.


          Currency exchanges are completed on behalf of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC by Fidelity FOREX, Inc., a Fidelity affiliate and may include a mark-up. More favorable exchange rates may be available through third parties not affiliated with Fidelity.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for MUELLER WATER PRODUCTS (NYSE:MWA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 6 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.86)Consensus Price Target: $13.83 (20.29% upside)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Astec Industries (NASDAQ:ASTE) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $73.00 (31.60% upside)

Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $64.67 (22.34% upside)

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.67)Consensus Price Target: $84.75 (5.40% upside)

Foreign investments involve greater risks than U.S. investments, including political and economic risks and the risk of currency fluctuations, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets.


The risk of loss in trading foreign currency can be substantial and may be magnified if trading on margin.

Core position



Uninvested cash

Uninvested cash in your account is held in what is known as a core position. Think of your core position as a place where money is held before you invest it or distribute it from your account. For the Fidelity Account®, you may choose one of many core positions:

Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Government securities and related debt, and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*
Fidelity Treasury Money Market Fund (FLTXX), a taxable mutual fund normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. Treasury securities and related repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. Intended for investors seeking as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity.*



							
								*
							
							
								
					
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.


Fidelity’s government and U.S. Treasury money market funds will not impose a fee upon the sale of your shares, nor temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets because of market conditions or other factors.
