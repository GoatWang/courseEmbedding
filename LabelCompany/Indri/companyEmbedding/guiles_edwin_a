Prior to his present role, Guiles was president of SDG&E from 1997 to 2000. He also served as executive vice president of Enova Corp., the parent company of SDG&E, from January to June 1998. Before that, Guiles was senior vice president of Enova Corp. from 1996 to 1997. In this role, he oversaw the regulatory process and transition planning for the merger of Enova Corp. and Pacific Enterprises.
From 1993 to 1997, Guiles served as senior vice president of Energy Supply for SDG&E, overseeing the company’s procurement, generation and transmission of electricity and natural gas. These responsibilities included operation of the company’s power plants, as well as administration of its 20-percent ownership of the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station.
