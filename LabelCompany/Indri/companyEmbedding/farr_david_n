He was eventually named CEO in October 2000 succeeding Charles F. Knight who had held the position for the previous 27 years.[5] Additionally, Farr was elected chairman of the board of Emerson in 2004.[8] Farr currently serves on the board of directors for IBM[9], the Delphi Corporation, the United Way of Greater St. Louis and is a member of The Business Council.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Farr was born in the United States in 1955. He went to Wake Forest University and graduated with a degree in chemistry in 1977.[6][7] He went on to earn an MBA from the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in 1981.[6][7]
Career[edit]
Farr began his career at Emerson more than 25 years ago. He held various positions upon his initial employment including manager of investor relations, vice president of corporate planning and development, president of the Ridge Tool division and group vice president for the industrial components and equipment business.[6] He ascended the corporate ladder serving as president of Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific and then chief executive officer of Emerson's Astec joint venture Astec(BSR) PLC.[8] He eventually became a senior executive vice president and chief operating officer in 1999. He was eventually named CEO in October 2000 succeeding Charles F. Knight who had held the position for the previous 27 years.[5] Additionally, Farr was elected chairman of the board of Emerson in 2004.[8] Farr currently serves on the board of directors for IBM[9], the Delphi Corporation, the United Way of Greater St. Louis and is a member of The Business Council.[6]
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Emerson Electric in 2009, David N. Farr earned a total compensation of $6,899,987, which included a base salary of $1,168,750, a cash bonus of $1,500,000, stock granted of $3,735,000, and other compensation totaling $496,237.[10]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Farr was the 2007 campaign chair for the United Way of Greater St. Louis,[11] leading the community to raise a record-breaking $68.8 million to help people in the 16-county region of metro St. Louis.[12] He was also named one of the Top 25 Managers in 2000.[13] Emerson has been awarded as well under Farr's management having been named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in 2004.[14] Institutional Investor magazine named David Farr, CEO of Emerson EMR, one of The Best CEOs in America in the electrical equipment and multi-industry in 2008.[15]
Farr has aggressively moved Emerson production and design operations to low-cost, low-regulation environments outside the United States, particularly the People's Republic of China. Under Farr's leadership, Emerson laid off 14% of its U.S. workforce in 2009, eliminating nearly 20,000 jobs. While speaking at the Baird Industrial Outlook Conference in Chicago, in November 2009, Farr attacked the Obama administration for its attention to "labor rules" and "health reform", and stated: "What do you think I'm going to do? I'm not going to hire anyone in the United States. I'm moving."
Personal life[edit]
Farr is married with two children and is a resident of Ladue, Missouri.[6]

      ■ David N. Farr's entire professional career was spent in
      key management positions with Emerson (formerly Emerson Electric), of St.
      Louis, Missouri. In 2000 he became the handpicked successor to chief
      executive officer Charles F. Knight, who had held the position for 27
      years. But it was a challenge for Farr to match the 43 years of
      consecutive earnings increases at Emerson. Nonetheless, Farr came into his
      own, pulling the company through a sluggish economy and a delicate
      restructuring plan to reassure investors that Emerson still had room to
      grow.
    

      AN EARLY RISER
    

      Upon graduation from Vanderbilt University with a master's degree
      in business administration, Farr joined St. Louis–based Emerson
      Electric Company in 1981. Over the ensuing years he mastered a series of
      key positions, including manager of investor relations, vice president of
      corporate planning and development, president of the Ridge Tool Division,
      group vice president for the Industrial Components and

      Equipment Business, president of Emerson Electric Asia-Pacific, chief
      executive officer of Emerson's Astec joint venture; and executive
      vice president over Emerson's Process Control Business.
    

      Being thus well seasoned in company operations, Farr was the heir apparent
      for the top positions at Emerson. In 1999 he became senior executive vice
      president and chief operating officer, and in October 2000 he was named
      chief executive officer. Taking over the helm from veteran chief executive
      officer Knight, Farr had his own ideas about how to put life back into the
      company.
    

      NEW BLOOD, NEW LIFE
    

      At the time Farr took over as chief executive officer, Emerson was
      enjoying an unbroken four-decade-long chain of proven
       consistency and market strength. But therein lay the challenge: Emerson
      had reached an apparent plateau in growth. Known for its electric
      compressors and motors, the company had been ready for a long time to try
      something new. However, Knight had not been impressed with the idea of
      entering the fields of electronics or faddish technology and had not
      wanted to upset the positive balance sheets. Morgan Roberts of Manchester
      Capital Management was quoted in 
      
        Forbes
      
       as saying, "The company's big weaknesses [were] that it
      ha[d] no top-line growth and that it [was] so closely aligned with the
      economy" (December 24, 2001).
    

      Farr intended to change all that. He did not fret about bottom lines, nor
      did he shy away from making tough moves. Responding to the challenge, he
      told Phyllis Berman of 
      
        Forbes
      
       (December 24, 2001): "We could have made our numbers. But the only
      way would have been to cut back on developing technological innovations.
      If we did that, we wouldn't be prepared when the economy turns
      up." He set about to effect change. Industry analysts expected
      great things. They were shocked when Farr announced that full-year
      earnings were down and that he intended to close 20 of Emerson's
      350 factories and would need to lay off 10 percent of the company's
      40,000 workers. As Berman noted in 
      
        Forbes
      
      , the compulsion for consistency may have cost Emerson some opportunities,
      but by freeing himself of that burden, Farr could go for faster growth.
    

      During the sluggish economy of 2001 and 2002, Farr spent time implementing
      change and preparing Emerson for a truly global market. He moved some of
      the U.S.-based power plants to China and Mexico and acquired the Avansys
      Power Company of China, with which to integrate operations. Production at
      the closed U.S. motors and appliance controls plants was moved to Mexico,
      China, and Eastern Europe. He also began to set up call centers in the
      Philippines and engineering centers in India and China, taking advantage
      of trained professionals there. Farr said that his goal was eventually to
      have half of Emerson's engineering staff in low-cost countries.
    

      A NEW MANAGEMENT STYLE
    

      Farr steadfastly reiterated his continued loyalty to his former mentor and
      personal friend, Charles Knight. However, both men conceded that they had
      different management styles and ways to effect change. Whereas Knight had
      wanted to see consistent earnings for his investors, Farr preferred to
      seize the opportunity to prepare for future growth and long-term value,
      even if that meant taking a few steps back to regroup.
    

      Farr's charismatic predecessor had run a tight ship, but Farr had a
      more informal management style. He did away with the monthly planning
      conferences, for which the company's top 100 executives would show
      up with bulging black binders crammed with figures and results. Instead,
      Farr simply asked each of them if his or her division was the scene of
      technological innovation. If not, he asked whether it was generating more
      cash. If neither was true, he warned them that they and their divisions
      might soon be gone.
    

      Farr's replacement planning strategy also differed from
      Knight's. Instead of grooming individuals in backup positions one
      tier down, he met annually with each general manager of Emerson's
      60 divisions to discuss organizational planning down to the
      middle-management level. Together, they would identify high-potential
      individuals, irrespective of their current positions or divisions, and
      enter them in Emerson's three-stage leadership development program.
    

      THE BOTTOM LINE
    

      Emerson was named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens for 2004 by 
      
        Business Ethics
      
       magazine. It was the company's second year to be so recognized.
      Emerson also remained one of America's Most Admired companies in 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine's annual rankings. Farr was awarded a 39 percent
      compensation increase for his 2003 performance, having successfully
      improved the company's operations and competitive position in the
      global marketplace, according to Emerson's proxy statement for that
      fiscal year. The proxy statement further noted Farr's
      "outstanding leadership in another challenging year," which
      resulted in stronger balance sheets and goal achievement for global market
      penetration, sales, and margin improvement. Despite the sluggish global
      economy, Farr's good use of that time to restructure ultimately
      increased Emerson's share in key markets, including the lucrative
      process control segment.
