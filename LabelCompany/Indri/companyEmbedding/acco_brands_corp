History[edit]
In 1903, Fred J. Kline founded the Clipper Manufacturing Company (a maker of paper clips) in Long Island, New York. In 1910, the company became the American Clip Company, and first used the name "ACCO" as an initialism, which became the company's formal name in 1922. After many acquisitions, ACCO went public in 1983, and was acquired in 1987 by American Brands (later Fortune Brands).
In 1990, ACCO acquired Hetzel in Germany,[2] a company selling stationery products.[3] In 1992, ACCO UK was created from the integration of ACCO Europe and Rexel Ltd. ACCO UK is the UK's largest manufacturer of office products.[citation needed] In 2005, ACCO was spun off from Fortune Brands and, through the merger with the General Binding Corporation, ACCO Brands was formed.[4]
In 2012, ACCO Brands completed a $860 million deal to combine with MeadWestvaco’s Consumer and Office Products business.[5] The transaction added brands like Mead, Five Star, Trapper Keeper, AT-A-GLANCE, Cambridge, Day Runner, Hilroy, Tilibra and Grafons to ACCO Brands' product line.[6]
Rexel[edit]
ACCO Brands is also the owner of the Rexel brand, which sells shredders, binding machines and staplers. Rexel products are sold both off-line in retail outlets and online via e-commerce stores worldwide. Some leading examples of online stores selling Rexel shredders are: Amazon in the US and Altimus Office Supplies LLC in the Middle East.
Kensington Computer Products[edit]
It also owns the subsidiary company, Kensington Computer Products Group, which is best known for the Kensington Security Slot and also sells computer accessories and peripherals such as computer mice, trackballs, computer keyboards, notebook bags, iPod accessories and power supplies. Kensington was founded in 1981 with the invention of the System Saver, a combined cooling fan and surge protector designed for use with the Apple II computer. They currently produce more than 300 different computer accessory products.

Our Commitment To Shareholder ValueACCO Brands Corporation is committed to delivering long-term value for our shareholders. The power of our brands, our unmatched global customer reach, and our strategic and market strengths put us in a strong position to achieve this goal.
Going forward, we are committed to solidifying our industry and market leadership while building enhanced shareholder value through steady growth in our sales, operating income and earnings per share.

Our HistoryACCO Brands Corporation has been one of the world’s largest suppliers of business, consumer and academic products for more than a century.  The company boasts a proud history of industry leadership, innovation and focus on delivering exceptional value for shareholders, customers and consumers by providing unique, leading-edge office products.
ACCO Brands Corporation’s roots stretch back to the founding of Wilson Jones in 1893, the American Clip Company (ACCO) in 1903 and the Swingline Company in 1925.  Together these companies helped revolutionize the ways in which we record, store and organize information through the creation of products like the ring binder, the paper clip and the widespread popularization of staplers.  In the mid‐1920s, ACCO became an international presence when it opened offices in Canada and England, and it eventually acquired popular European office products brands such as Rexel®, a leading supplier of office products such as paper shredders, staplers, hole punches and laminators, and NOBO®, one of the world’s largest suppliers of office products, including white boards and easels. Later, it established itself in Australia and New Zealand with the addition of the Marbig® line of products, offering consumers a wide range of products with everything they need to work efficiently at home, work, school and on-the-go.  In 2005, the ACCO World office products unit of Fortune Brands joined together with General Binding Corporation (GBC), a manufacturer and developer of binding and laminating machines and supplies, creating ACCO Brands Corporation, an independent publicly traded company.  The transaction brought together the complementary businesses, brands and strengths of ACCO World and GBC to form the world's largest supplier of branded office products.  ACCO Brands Corporation merged with MeadWestvaco’s Consumer & Office Products business in 2012, adding well-known school and office product brands including Mead®, Five Star®, Trapper Keeper®, AT-A-GLANCE®, Cambridge®, Day Runner®, Hilroy®, Tilibra® and Grafon’s™.  In 2016, ACCO Brands acquired Pelikan Artline in Australia and New Zealand. 
In 2017, ACCO Brands acquired Esselte, a leading global manufacturer and marketer of office products and business supplies.  Esselte first put its mark on the office products industry in 1913, when 13 Swedish printing and graphic businesses joined forces to create the company SLT.  After more than 55 years in business as SLT, the company renamed itself Esselte in 1970 and acquired several high-profile international brands.
At the end of the 20th century, Esselte acquired Leitz, Germany's largest office supplier and inventor of the lever arch file.  With a renewed focus on innovation, Esselte then acquired the world-renowned stapling and fixation specialist brand Rapid®, and Xyron®, a brand of innovative products for craft, education and creative professional markets.  Today, the products of ACCO Brands can be found in more than 100 countries around the world. As home to more than 20 top brands in their categories – including Artline®, AT-A-GLANCE®,Derwent®, Five Star®, GBC®, Kensington®, Mead®, Leitz®, Quartet®, Rapid®, Swingline®, Tilibra® and Wilson Jones® – the company is poised to continue its global leadership and growth.

Even in a world where everything is increasingly paperless, sometimes there's no substitute for physical records. Folders are an essential part of any business's office supplies list and help prevent clutter from building up on your desk; keeping all of your vital paperwork organized. Tax records, contracts and insurance certificates are easy to access when you file them properly in a filing system, and pocket folders store class materials like syllabi, exam study questions and homework.
Long-Term File Storage
Law firms, accountants and tax preparers need to store thousands of files for clients and regulatory purposes. File storage boxes have removable lids and heavy-duty cardboard construction so you can keep them indefinitely in a storage room or onsite archive. Plastic file totes are waterproof and keep out pests like mites, moths and silverfish so your most important records remain pristine. Plastic crates with wing lids and locking lids prevent mildew and mold from infiltrating paperwork in damp environments.
File Folders for Quick and Easy Access 
Keep all of your surfaces tidy and clean by using an organized file system for work and home. Create customized color-coded systems with colored file folders or keep it simple with manila files. Reinforced tabs won't rip or tear with frequent handling. Packs with assorted tab positions make it easier to locate specific files in a crowded drawer. Card stock is more resilient for long-term durability.
Sort It with Hanging Files
The gliding convenience of hanging files helps you group similar folders together and ultimately protect your paperwork. Place the plastic tab anywhere on the top and sort your records by client names, months, years and details. Coated hangers on the side allow for easy sliding. If you're eco-conscious, look for folders made with post-consumer recycled paper.
A Presentation to Remember
Pocket folders keep presentation materials together for current and prospective clients. Laser-cut tabs on internal pockets let you include one or two business cards, so contact info is always close at hand. Plastic folders are reusable and sturdy, so they're ideal for transporting sensitive documents, photographs or schoolwork. Students may opt for clear or colored plastic folders to store and organize assignments term after term, especially if they need to prevent bending and tearing inside of a backpack or locker. Three-hole presentation folders fit into a binder to keep class work and papers organized. Report covers with clear fronts frame eye-catching graphics for an immediate impression.
Accordion Files Keep Everything Handy 
When you need to bring files offsite, or you don't have enough space in a dorm or apartment for a full-size file cabinet, accordion files have expandable compartments to hold tax records, receipts, escrow documents and contracts. Expanding wallets have elastic cords to keep contents secure while you're traveling from meeting to meeting.
File Sorters
If you've got a stack of paperwork you regularly reference for big accounts or ongoing projects, keep those files easily accessible on your desk with a file sorter. Mesh sorters look modern and fashionable in any office or home and have several compartments for folders and paperwork. Step file sorters have an angled rack to make tabs easier to read. Desk trays have discreet compartments for folders, fliers, portfolios and brochures.

"Submitting presentations to the boss, storing an entire year's worth of accounting information or filing important documents is simple with binders, folders and accessories. Ensure that binders meet business demands with an assortment of office binder accessories, such as tabbed dividers, pockets, sheet protectors and more. Hanging folders and binders let users categorize and subcategorize documents in a filing cabinet, ensuring quick access to needed documents without taking up any valuable shelf space.

Wide Variety Available
 Binders, folders and accessories, including dividers and sheet protectors, keep all types of important business documents organized and safely stored. They come in a wide variety of shapes, colors and applications to meet any business' demands -- including a variety of ring configurations like zipper binders to keep loose contents secure and attractive  presentation binders. Make sure binders are used to their full potential with the help of additional accessories, such as dividers and inserts. Pocket  binder folders and report covers are ideal for submitting professional-looking presentations.

Binder Accessories
Organize and protect the material within binders, folders and reference materials with the right accessories. Sheet protectors come in a standard 8.5 x 11 inches or in specialty sizes, and they fit nicely into standard and presentation binders to keep pages free from stains, smudges and tears. Tabbed dividers let users categorize sheets within binders, folders and files, eliminating endless searches for particular pages inside office binders. 

Binder Pockets
Made of plastic or paper, pocket folder binders can hold materials such as brochures, CDs and business cards when used inside folders and binders. They are available in nearly any color and often come in multipacks to fulfill the needs of larger offices. Store receipts in a mini pocket folder for easy record keeping, or add your business card to a stack of  office binders with adhesive pockets designed to stick to the interior or exterior of the binder."

History[edit]
In 1903, Fred J. Kline founded the Clipper Manufacturing Company (a maker of paper clips) in Long Island, New York. In 1910, the company became the American Clip Company, and first used the name "ACCO" as an initialism, which became the company's formal name in 1922. After many acquisitions, ACCO went public in 1983, and was acquired in 1987 by American Brands (later Fortune Brands).
In 1990, ACCO acquired Hetzel in Germany,[2] a company selling stationery products.[3] In 1992, ACCO UK was created from the integration of ACCO Europe and Rexel Ltd. ACCO UK is the UK's largest manufacturer of office products.[citation needed] In 2005, ACCO was spun off from Fortune Brands and, through the merger with the General Binding Corporation, ACCO Brands was formed.[4]
In 2012, ACCO Brands completed a $860 million deal to combine with MeadWestvaco’s Consumer and Office Products business.[5] The transaction added brands like Mead, Five Star, Trapper Keeper, AT-A-GLANCE, Cambridge, Day Runner, Hilroy, Tilibra and Grafons to ACCO Brands' product line.[6]
Rexel[edit]
ACCO Brands is also the owner of the Rexel brand, which sells shredders, binding machines and staplers. Rexel products are sold both off-line in retail outlets and online via e-commerce stores worldwide. Some leading examples of online stores selling Rexel shredders are: Amazon in the US and Altimus Office Supplies LLC in the Middle East.
Kensington Computer Products[edit]
It also owns the subsidiary company, Kensington Computer Products Group, which is best known for the Kensington Security Slot and also sells computer accessories and peripherals such as computer mice, trackballs, computer keyboards, notebook bags, iPod accessories and power supplies. Kensington was founded in 1981 with the invention of the System Saver, a combined cooling fan and surge protector designed for use with the Apple II computer. They currently produce more than 300 different computer accessory products.

History[edit]
In 1903, Fred J. Kline founded the Clipper Manufacturing Company (a maker of paper clips) in Long Island, New York. In 1910, the company became the American Clip Company, and first used the name "ACCO" as an initialism, which became the company's formal name in 1922. After many acquisitions, ACCO went public in 1983, and was acquired in 1987 by American Brands (later Fortune Brands).
In 1990, ACCO acquired Hetzel in Germany,[2] a company selling stationery products.[3] In 1992, ACCO UK was created from the integration of ACCO Europe and Rexel Ltd. ACCO UK is the UK's largest manufacturer of office products.[citation needed] In 2005, ACCO was spun off from Fortune Brands and, through the merger with the General Binding Corporation, ACCO Brands was formed.[4]
In 2012, ACCO Brands completed a $860 million deal to combine with MeadWestvaco’s Consumer and Office Products business.[5] The transaction added brands like Mead, Five Star, Trapper Keeper, AT-A-GLANCE, Cambridge, Day Runner, Hilroy, Tilibra and Grafons to ACCO Brands' product line.[6]
Rexel[edit]
ACCO Brands is also the owner of the Rexel brand, which sells shredders, binding machines and staplers. Rexel products are sold both off-line in retail outlets and online via e-commerce stores worldwide. Some leading examples of online stores selling Rexel shredders are: Amazon in the US and Altimus Office Supplies LLC in the Middle East.
Kensington Computer Products[edit]
It also owns the subsidiary company, Kensington Computer Products Group, which is best known for the Kensington Security Slot and also sells computer accessories and peripherals such as computer mice, trackballs, computer keyboards, notebook bags, iPod accessories and power supplies. Kensington was founded in 1981 with the invention of the System Saver, a combined cooling fan and surge protector designed for use with the Apple II computer. They currently produce more than 300 different computer accessory products.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
