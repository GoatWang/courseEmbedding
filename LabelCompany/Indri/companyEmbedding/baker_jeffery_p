Profile




ABOUT ME

I am a general pediatrician with a special interest in developmental pediatrics especially in children with complex issues or autism spectrum disorders. I’ve been working at Duke since 1989. The most rewarding experience for me as a doctor is when I am able to help parents feel comfortable handling complex medical issues at home. It’s important to me to work with the parents as a partner who assists them in raising their children. As part of the Duke Health System, Duke Pediatrics has access to many resources and specialists. It’s critical to have a pediatrician you feel comfortable with to be your guide and partner in approaching the health system. Outside of work, I’m an avid reader and enjoy backpacking.

Professional Experience
2009-present: HYDROLOGIST, U.S. Geological Survey, MD-DE-DC Water Science Center, Baltimore, MD
Member, NAWQA Integrated Watershed Studies (IWS) Team, 2013-present. Developed and published a method for base-flow estimation using a digital filter constrained by chemical mass balance.
Project chief, MD-DE-DC Groundwater Network, 2016-present. Managed resources, staff schedules, data collection, processing, quality assurance, and publication for network of over 470 wells.
Developed or modified groundwater-flow models for Assateague Island National Seashore, the Anacostia River watershed (using objective parameter estimation), and a part of central Maryland impacted by Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC).
Contributed to groundwater-quality studies at the Standard Chlorine of Delaware, Inc. Superfund Site.
Project scientist, Comprehensive Assessment of Water Supply in Maryland project; focused on quantifying groundwater availability using models and age dating.
2006-present: GROUNDWATER SPECIALIST, U.S. Geological Survey, MD-DE-DC Water Science Center, Baltimore, MD
Responsible for overall quality of groundwater science and data for the MD-DE-DC Water Science Center.
Leader, Data Quality Management Team, 2014-present. Worked closely with database administrators to develop and implement data-quality assurance processes.
2004-09: HYDROLOGIST/RESEARCH HYDROLOGIST, U.S. Geological Survey, MD-DE-DC Water Science Center, Baltimore, MD
Project chief, Chesapeake Bay River Input Monitoring project, 2005-07. Managed project resources and data collection at four major river water-quality sites. Developed new methods for analyzing and communicating results of load and trend estimation (using ESTIMATOR) to Cooperators, the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP), and the public.
Collaborated in improving parametric and nonparametric statistical methods used for water-quality status and trends in nontidal rivers in Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
Lead author, unpublished report on factors affecting water quality in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.
Worked closely with CBP scientists in calibrating the Phase 5 HSPF model.
2000-present: LECTURER, The Johns Hopkins University, Engineering for Professionals, Baltimore, MD.
1999-2004: SUPERVISORY HYDROLOGIST, U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Division, MD-DE-DC District, Baltimore, MD

Developed and published the software package RST2D (Reactive Solute Transport in 2 Dimensions), a family of codes providing an environment for numerical simulation of processes occurring in sedimentary basins: steady or transient saturated groundwater flow, based on either a hydraulic head or stream function approach; steady or transient heat transport, which may be coupled with groundwater flow for variable-density problems; and conservative or reactive multicomponent mass transport (assuming local geochemical equilibrium). Codes have been used as the basis for computations in at least 30 peer-reviewed publications (complete list available on request).
1989-92: RESEARCH ASSISTANT, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD
1987-88: TECHNICAL INTERN, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research, Washington, DC

Optimal hydrograph separation using a recursive digital filter constrained by chemical mass balance, with application to selected Chesapeake Bay watersheds
Quantitative estimates of base flow are necessary to address questions concerning the vulnerability and response of the Nation’s water supply to natural and human-induced change in environmental conditions. An objective of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water-Quality Assessment Project is to determine how hydrologic systems are affected by...

Old groundwater in parts of the upper Patapsco aquifer,Atlantic Coastal Plain, Maryland, USA: Evidence fromradiocarbon, chlorine-36 and helium-4
Apparent groundwater ages along two flow paths in the upper Patapsco aquifer of the Maryland Atlantic Coastal Plain, USA, were estimated using 14C, 36Cl and 4He data. Most of the ages range from modern to about 500 ka, with one sample at 117 km downgradient from the recharge area dated by radiogenic 4He accumulation at more than one Ma. Last...
