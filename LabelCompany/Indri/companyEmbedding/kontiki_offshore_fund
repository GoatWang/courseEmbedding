About 
	Our Team

	Seahorse is owned and operated by the Phil and Tracey Scherer who live in the original birthplace of kontiki fishing - Tauranga, New Zealand, situated in the South Pacific. It's also where all Seahorse products are designed and built. Being close to the beach, and being kontiki owners ourselves, we are able to continually develop the Seahorse product range to ensure we bring you the best kontiki products on the market.

	We have brought a range of business, manufacturing and fishing skills to the product. We use the Seahorse products whenever we can learning and developing as we go. Our team is committed to delivering the ultimate beach kontiki fishing experience using equipment that is second to none. Call us to discuss your fishing requirements and we will be able to recommend the perfect solution for you.



	History

	Kontiki fishing is a traditional form of fishing from the Pacific Islands including New Zealand. The New Zealanders have made it a enjoyable pastime which has been popular since the 1940's and possibly earlier. Originally kontiki fishing used sail rafts or inflated tyres with sails to pull lines from the beach, and these early lines had a hundred or more hooks on each set. Given the success we have now with only up to 25 hooks, it makes you wonder what they did with all the fish!



	The south-westerly winds that are common in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, and with it's long sandy beaches provided the perfect conditions for the development of the early sail Kontikis, and they proved this style of fishing could be very successful. 

	These early kontiki units had interesting systems to improve their performance, including using sugar sweets as timers, and dropping sails to make the retrieval easier. The sweets would slowly dissolve in the water and once dissolved, the Kontiki sail would drop sometimes releasing a weight to anchor the fishing line once the wind powered Kontiki was well offshore. However there was always the problem with the children eating the sweets on the way to the beach.



	During the 1980s and 1990s, kite fishing became a popular method of beach fishing, and due to the improved performance it almost took over from the sail rafts method. But kites still suffered the same problems of having to rely on offshore winds to operate, and these generally only happened midweek when you were at work.

	Motorised Kontikis have been around in numerous home-made forms since before the 1970s, all of which tried to overcome the problem of relying on the wind. Motorising the kontiki and winch created their own problems. In general, the machines were temperamental and required the knack of the builder to keep them running. From the late 1990s, a number of these home-builders started selling their units in small numbers but none of them provided the performance and reliability demanded by the fishing public. This is where Seahorse Kontikis stepped in.

	Our Story

	Seahorse Kontikis started developing and selling electric Kontikis and winches in 2001, with the desire to build and sell reliable electric Kontikis. Calling on the best commercial fishing practices, and using the best marine electronics available, Seahorse Kontikis developed the first Seahorse kontiki system with a 30lb thrust motor. With waterproof components, reliability and performance that outstripped anything else available, the Seahorse system became an instant best seller. Within six months, Seahorse had become the number one Kontiki manufacturer in New Zealand and the world.



	In 2003, Seahorse introduced the plastic roto-moulded body made from polyethylene, and a new, improved control unit. The control unit monitored the status of the batteries and had an electronic timer. This was what the New Zealand public was waiting for, and these improvements resulted in Seahorse Kontikis being used everywhere



	In 2004, the Seahorse 46 Kontiki was developed and released to the market, replacing the existing kontiki with a more powerful motor. It quickly became the kontiki of choice, and excelled in big surf conditions allowing fishers to explore new fishing grounds. The aluminium framed traceboard was also introduced enabling traces to be attached quickly and safely.

	 



	The years rolled pass with continuous improvements being made to the Seahorse products. Finally in 2011 the GPS Seahorse 46 Kontiki was released the the fishing public to much acclaim. Finally a Kontiki unit that would steer itself where you wanted it to go it. The GPS Seahorse 46 became an immediate best seller as it gave the fishers exactly what they wanted.

	2012 saw the first GPS Seahorse kontiki sold to a customer in the USA, which was quickly followed by more, as the word spread about this new and successful form of fishing. Because of this increasing demand, Seahorse USA has been created to to provide these customers with the service and support they deserve. 



	In 2012, Seahorse had sold Kontikis into over 20 coutries around the world, including France, Japan, Australia and our first sale to the USA. This was the first of many, and finally in 2015, Seahorse will have be based in Georgia, and we will be able to provide the same high standard of service to our customers in the USA. Plus it gives Tracey and myself a great reason to spend time on some ofthe best beaches in the world.





		2015 has seen a new model become avaliable. The New Seahorse S30, powered by a Lithium battery, this mighty mini with it's next generation GPS autopilot system .

		Seahorse USA

		Seahorse USA Inc. has been set up to provide our customers with the service and support they deserve, and to allow even more fishers to experience this amazing and relaxingly style of fishing. Based in Georgia, Seahorse USA is perfectly based to serve customers along the Eastern Seaboard, and the Gulf States.

ShoreThing Kontiki Dropper Rig






















Protect your kontiki from sharks, fish through drifting weed and much more. The ShoreThing is the Safest Kontiki Setting System available. Hundreds of Kontiki's have been lost due to sharks biting through the mainline. Why risk losing yours?



Price:NZ$800.00




Purchase Qty:1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374757677787980818283848586878889909192939495969798991001101201301401501601701801902002102202302402502602702802903003103203303403503603703803904004104204304404504604704804905006007008009001000
 














The reason is simple, sharks are attracted to both the baits and any fish caught on the hook section.
Having baits and fish on the same line that is used to haul the Kontiki back to shore is very risky.
You just don't know if you will get it back. Now, there is a simple answer to the shark bite-offs and lost kontiki's. It's the ShoreThing Kontiki Fishing System.
If you are considering buying kontiki, check out this system first, it is by far the safest and most efficient way of setting hooks with an absolutely minimal chance of losing an expensive kontiki.
Give us a call and we will tell you what you do and don't need for the ShoreThing Fishing System. You won't need clip on weights, a hook section in your mainline, a 150-meter leader line or a trace rack and traces. This could save you up to $400 from your kontiki package.
The ShoreThing Kontiki Fishing System is a fully automatic longline setting device that is towed behind your existing kontiki and sets the hooks far away from the mainline. When sharks bite through the hook section, you only lose a few dollars worth of hooks, instead of between 1000 to 2000 dollars worth of kontiki, hook section and leader line.

The ShoreThing is a dropper rig system that deploys a 25 hook, baited longline offshore when a timer releases the weight on the end of the hook section. The 72 ounces of weight anchors the kontiki much more securely than any other system. The weights are dispersed along the hook section and this dramatically reduces any risk of tangles in the hook section.

The ShoreThing Kontiki Dropper Rig Has These Advantages
Advantage 1. Sharks Biting Through Hook Section
If you have a ShoreThing Kontiki Fishing System the chances of losing your kontiki as a result of sharks biting through your hook section is very, very low because of the much greater distance between the hooked shark and the critical mainline. If you don't have a ShoreThing and a shark bites through your hook section then you cannot recover your kontiki from the beach with your mainline, if you can't get someone with a boat to rescue it, the kontiki is lost. According to
customer reports and our vast experience with kite longlines, (a very similar system to a conventional kontiki rig), it appears that well over half of conventional kontikis lost, are due to shark bite-offs.
Advantage 2. Snagged and Broken Hook Section
Snagged hook sections are the second most common cause of kontiki loss. If your 100kg to 150kg mainline is in good condition the snagged 65kg hook section of the ShoreThing will either break through abrasion on the snag, or the 65kg drop-line will break. You will still be able to recover the kontiki as usual. As with any kontiki you still have to keep your mainline in tip top condition. If you have a conventional kontiki and snag the hook section you are stuck until you break the mainline and lose the kontiki if you can get a boat to rescue it.
NOTE: A few other kontikis are cut off by boat propellers and vehicles driving through the mainlines on the beaches, both of these are avoidable if you take care where and when you set, and keep your gear near the waters edge, and not with mainlines spanning the entire width of the beach as some do. If just the mainline of a ShoreThing or conventional kontiki rig goes under a ledge or submerged tree the chances of losing either is still the same so we do not recommend fishing the ShoreThing in snaggy areas.
Advantage 3. Less Drag
The ShoreThingis easier to tow out than a conventional kontiki hook section and leader line despite the fact that it carries far more weight to better anchor the kontiki against the rip. In our tow trials we used a boat with a GPS to tow the gear and always towed the same stretch of water consecutively. Most 46lb thrust kontikis set between two and three knots. The conventional hook section in the test was 150 meters of 100kg line, 32 ounces of weight (4 X 8 oz) and an 115 kg 80 hook pre-stoppered hook section baited with 25 average sized baits. The ShoreThing as tested had a 25 hook longline aboard, baited with average sized baits, 72 ounces of weight on the hook section and a 30 meter drop-line. The ShoreThing had around half the drag of a conventional hook section at normal kontiki setting speeds of two to three knots.
Many beaches have steep offshore banks that are quite shallow. A conventional kontiki hook section can get bogged or really struggle to get the line over the bank as the mainline weights and following hook section bulldoze into the bank and bury deep into the sand. The drag from this can be enough to spoil the set, or run the batteries flat before the gear has reached the fishing area. If the weights are left off to get over the bank, then drift when set becomes an even greater problem with the conventional kontiki system. The ShoreThing floats everything well above the bank and the un-weighted mainline, free from heavy weights and bulky baited traces and clips, slides easily up and over the offshore banks while carrying plenty of weight aboard to anchor everything at the pre-set fishing distance.
Advantage 4. Set Further Out
The normal length of a leader line on a kontiki is 150 meters, this means when set to 1000 meters, the furthermost hook out is 850 meters offshore. On the same 1000 meter set with a ShoreThing the furthermost out hook is 990 meters offshore.
Advantage 5. Better Anchoring
The ShoreThing usually carries 72 ounces of lead (it can carry more). As the weight is on-board the ShoreThing it does not have to be dragged along the bottom on the way out. When set the 72 ounces is distributed along the length of the hook section with heavier weights at each end. This weighting pattern acts like a chain and is very efficient and tangle resistant. A thin wire grapple or large breakout sinkers on a safety trace can also be added to the very end of the hook section if greater anchoring capability is required.
Advantage 6. Beat Drifting Weed
Some areas suffer drifting weed (red weed, sack weed, sea lettuce) which can form into clumps over the baited hooks when setting a conventional kontiki. Usually, fish will seldom be caught when the weed is around the hooks or covering the bait. This weed is often in a belt near the beach. TheShoreThing Kontiki Fishing System will always set the hooks clean of weed at the desired distance offshore and often beyond the affected area. You will still catch weed on the way back in, but it will be much less than the conventional system, as you have only passed through the weed belt once on the way in. Best of all you have a much better chance of catching fish because your baited hooks were weed free while the gear was fishing.
Advantage 7. Better Catch Rates
When using ShoreThing Kontiki Fishing Systemthe baits are not dragged over the seabed for one to two kilometres before fishing commences. The baits are carried aboard the ShoreThing and are set in tiptop condition right where you have decided to set. The extra weight on the ShoreThing hook section further enhances catch rates.
Advantage 8. Stress Free Fishing
Once the gear is out you can relax. The gear is very well anchored and your kontiki is vastly safer than a conventional system, even if sharks bite through your hook section, or you snag the hook section. However you will still need to keep the reel near the waters edge and avoid areas where there are snags, boats are active or commercial fishers set nets, lines and crab pots etc.
Advantage 9. You Don't Need a Trace Rack or Hook Section in Your Mainline
Mainline maintenance is a breeze, you just need bare line wound onto a winch or beach reel. You don't need a trace rack or clip on traces either, as everything to do with fishing is always stored on the ShoreThing. So if you are thinking of buying a kontiki rig, give us a call and we will tell you what you do and don't need for the ShoreThing Fishing System.
