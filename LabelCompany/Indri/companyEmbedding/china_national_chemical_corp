If it's a product of the downstream chemical manufacturing process, then state-owned China National Chemical Corporation probably makes it. The company, among China's largest industrial firms, is known as ChemChina, and is divided itself into six units. The largest is Advanced Materials & Specialty Chemicals, followed by Chlor-alkali & Basic Chemical Products, and Agrochemicals. ChemChina also refines petroleum, manufactures rubber and silicone products, and manufactures specialty chemicals. The company operates in 140 countries worldwide. In 2017 ChemChina acquired Switzerland-based Syngenta for $43 billion.

ChemChina produces a wide array of chemicals and is also a leading manufacturer of tires, conveyor belts and chemical machinery.

He founded his first company, Bluestar, in 1984 with loan of less than $5,000 and presided over its expansion from an industrial-cleaning company to a chemicals conglomerate, acquiring more than 100 state-owned Chinese chemicals companies. It later merged with other businesses affiliated with China’s chemicals ministry and Mr. Ren was named head of the state-owned behemoth.

What has the company been buying?
Share on Twitter





Since 2006, ChemChina has spent billions of dollars on overseas acquisitions in countries including France, Italy, Germany, Israel and the U.K. Its more notable acquisitions include Italian tire maker Pirelli, which it bought for about $7.7 billion last year, and Israel’s Makhteshim Agan Group, the world’s largest maker of generic pesticides, for about $2.4 billion in 2011. Other acquisitions include France’s Adisseo Group and Rhodia, makers of animal feed and organic silicon, respectively, and KraussMaffei Group, a German company that makes equipment to process plastics and rubber.

Why does it want Syngenta?
Share on Twitter





ChemChina says it wants to grow Syngenta’s business in China and other emerging markets, but it may also have an eye on the pesticide and seed giant’s significant foothold in the U.S. Acquiring Syngenta’s intellectual property is also attractive, as the Swiss company develops genetically engineered seeds that may help further open the tightly-regulated Chinese market for biotech crops.

China National Chemical Corporation Key Developments

Nufarm Races Sumitomo For ChemChina Assets
Jul 11 17
Nufarm Limited (ASX:NUF) is believed to be closing in on a $500 million, portfolio of China National Chemical Corporation's (ChemChina) protection assets, according to sources, in a sales process where the listed Australian agrochemicals operation is going head to head with its major shareholder Sumitomo Chemical Company, Limited (TSE:4005). A dataroom is understood to have been opened by ChemChina for the sale of assets within its subsidiary ADAMA Agricultural Solutions Ltd.


Federal Trade Commission Approves Final Order with China National Chemical Corporation and Syngenta AG, Preserving Competition in U.S. Markets for Three Pesticides
Jun 16 17
Federal Trade Commission has approved a final order settling charges that the proposed merger of China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina) and Syngenta AG would harm competition in the U.S. markets for the herbicide paraquat, the insecticide abamectin, and the fungicide chlorothalonil. First announced in April 2017, the complaint alleged that without the proposed divestiture, the merger would eliminate the direct competition that exists between ChemChina generics subsidiary ADAMA and Syngenta's branded products. The merger would also increase the likelihood that U.S. customers buying paraquat, abamectin and chlorothalonil would be forced to pay higher prices or accept reduced service for these products, the complaint states.


EuroChem Group AG and China National Chemical Corporation Consider Starting Joint Production in Russia
Jun 15 17
EuroChem Group AG announced the signing of a Memorandum of Intent ("Memorandum") with China National Chemical Corporation ("ChemChina") for a potential partnership to jointly produce industrial products in Russia (the "Project"). Both companies agreed to form a working group to further evaluate the technical feasibility of the Project and will carry out due diligence. Under the Memorandum, EuroChem and ChemChina consider jointly starting production of industrial products, specifically propylene oxide (propylene glycol and polyols) and isocyanate (MDI/TDI). The former has vast application across many industries, including for the development of synthetic lubricants, surfactants, and polyurethane products, with the latter mainly used for thermal insulation in construction. This will be the first production of its kind for Russia and the CIS which currently rely on imports from Germany, the Benelux countries, the US and Japan. Future output is expected to be sold predominantly in Russia to meet growing internal demand. If it goes ahead, the Project will be implemented at EuroChem's Novomoskovskiy Azot plant in the Tula region, Russia. This will allow EuroChem to optimise current production capacity at this facility by integrating the additional downstream production process which will utilize existing by-products and infrastructure. ChemChina will deliver the necessary production technology.

China National Chemical Corporation (commonly called ChemChina) is a Chinese state-owned chemical company in the product segments of agrochemicals, rubber products, chemical materials and specialty chemicals, industrial equipment, and petrochemical processing.[2] As of 2015, it is ranked 265th among the Fortune Global 500 companies.[3]

History[edit]
Bluestar Company[edit]
ChemChina began as a small solvents factory called Bluestar Company (Chinese: 蓝星公司), founded by Ren Jianxin in 1984 with a 10,000-yuan loan.[4] Ren created the ChemChina empire by taking control of over 100 troubled state-owned chemical factories across China, with the government retaining ownership. Meanwhile, he avoided laying off excess workers by shifting them to the company's Malan Noodle (zh) restaurant chain.[5] He brought in consultants to professionalize the company's management, and it has become one of China's most dynamic state enterprises.[5]
State company[edit]
In May 2004, after the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved a merger of companies formerly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry as the China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), Ren Jianxin became its CEO; in December 2014 he became the chairman of the board of directors.[4]
Within ChemChina's agrochemicals business is a large portfolio of companies including Sanonda Holdings, Cangzhou Dahua, Shandong Dacheng, Jiangsu Anpon, Anhui Petrochemicals, and Huaihe Chemicals. It added Israel-based Makhteshim Agan (renamed to ADAMA Agricultural Solutions ) in 2011 to the division in a 2.4 billion US dollars acquisition of a 60% stake in the company, the largest manufacturer of generic pesticides.[6]
The chemical materials and speciality chemicals group made overseas acquisitions with two deals in 2006, both to acquire French companies.[7] The first one was the Adisseo Group, a global animal nutrition feed firm that specialized in producing methionine, vitamins and biological enzymes. At the time of the purchase, Adisseo had worldwide market share of 30% in methionine.[7] The other company was the organic silicon and sulphide business of Rhodia.[7] With this acquisition the company became the third largest producer in the world of organic silicon.[7]
The petrochemical processing division has been operating refineries including small ones known as teapot plants, giving it an oil processing capacity of about 25 million tonnes (25,000,000 long tons; 28,000,000 short tons) a year or about 500,000 barrels per day. After regulations liberalized the import of crude and fuel products in China, the company opened a trading office in Singapore in October 2013.[citation needed]
In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a €7.1 billion bid from ChemChina for the world’s fifth-largest tyre maker.[8][9]
Syngenta acquisition[edit]
In February 2016, ChemChina agreed a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta,[10] the largest ever foreign purchase by a Chinese firm.[11][10] The deal was awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and European government panels, citing food safety and security concerns. In June 2016, both companies refiled the transaction for CFIUS approval, forcing them to restart the application process.[12] In August 2016, the CFIUS cleared the deal, while the merger still awaited the regulatory review and concessions made towards the European Commission,[13] in particular with regard to divesting itself from agrochemical subsidiary ADAMA Agricultural Solutions (which was planned to sell to ChemChina's associated company Sanonda). The deal was completed in May 2017.[14]
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission cleared the deal in December 2016, but the buy-out was again delayed due to European antitrust investigations.[15] In April 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission both approved the merger, requiring ChemChina to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin and chlorothalonil.[16][17] The European Commission also addressed competition concerns with regard to plant growth regulators and reiterated the expected commitments for divestment from ADAMA-related products.[18] As of May 26, 2017, ChemChina's plan to purchase Syngenta for $44 billion was nearing completion,[11] with ChemChina amassing "huge bridge loans" to pay Syngenta stockholders.[11]
Sinochem merger[edit]
In May 2017, Reuters, reported that discussion had begun regarding the merging and consolidation of ChemChina and state-owned Sinochem, overtaking industry leaders such as BASF, in a deal worth around $120 billion.[19]

History[edit]
Bluestar Company[edit]
ChemChina began as a small solvents factory called Bluestar Company (Chinese: 蓝星公司), founded by Ren Jianxin in 1984 with a 10,000-yuan loan.[4] Ren created the ChemChina empire by taking control of over 100 troubled state-owned chemical factories across China, with the government retaining ownership. Meanwhile, he avoided laying off excess workers by shifting them to the company's Malan Noodle (zh) restaurant chain.[5] He brought in consultants to professionalize the company's management, and it has become one of China's most dynamic state enterprises.[5]
State company[edit]
In May 2004, after the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved a merger of companies formerly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry as the China National Chemical Corporation (ChemChina), Ren Jianxin became its CEO; in December 2014 he became the chairman of the board of directors.[4]
Within ChemChina's agrochemicals business is a large portfolio of companies including Sanonda Holdings, Cangzhou Dahua, Shandong Dacheng, Jiangsu Anpon, Anhui Petrochemicals, and Huaihe Chemicals. It added Israel-based Makhteshim Agan (renamed to ADAMA Agricultural Solutions ) in 2011 to the division in a 2.4 billion US dollars acquisition of a 60% stake in the company, the largest manufacturer of generic pesticides.[6]
The chemical materials and speciality chemicals group made overseas acquisitions with two deals in 2006, both to acquire French companies.[7] The first one was the Adisseo Group, a global animal nutrition feed firm that specialized in producing methionine, vitamins and biological enzymes. At the time of the purchase, Adisseo had worldwide market share of 30% in methionine.[7] The other company was the organic silicon and sulphide business of Rhodia.[7] With this acquisition the company became the third largest producer in the world of organic silicon.[7]
The petrochemical processing division has been operating refineries including small ones known as teapot plants, giving it an oil processing capacity of about 25 million tonnes (25,000,000 long tons; 28,000,000 short tons) a year or about 500,000 barrels per day. After regulations liberalized the import of crude and fuel products in China, the company opened a trading office in Singapore in October 2013.[citation needed]
In March 2015, it was announced that Pirelli shareholders had accepted a €7.1 billion bid from ChemChina for the world’s fifth-largest tyre maker.[8][9]
Syngenta acquisition[edit]
In February 2016, ChemChina agreed a $43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta,[10] the largest ever foreign purchase by a Chinese firm.[11][10] The deal was awaiting approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and European government panels, citing food safety and security concerns. In June 2016, both companies refiled the transaction for CFIUS approval, forcing them to restart the application process.[12] In August 2016, the CFIUS cleared the deal, while the merger still awaited the regulatory review and concessions made towards the European Commission,[13] in particular with regard to divesting itself from agrochemical subsidiary ADAMA Agricultural Solutions (which was planned to sell to ChemChina's associated company Sanonda). The deal was completed in May 2017.[14]
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission cleared the deal in December 2016, but the buy-out was again delayed due to European antitrust investigations.[15] In April 2017, the European Commissioner for Competition and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission both approved the merger, requiring ChemChina to divest from pesticide production of paraquat, abamectin and chlorothalonil.[16][17] The European Commission also addressed competition concerns with regard to plant growth regulators and reiterated the expected commitments for divestment from ADAMA-related products.[18] As of May 26, 2017, ChemChina's plan to purchase Syngenta for $44 billion was nearing completion,[11] with ChemChina amassing "huge bridge loans" to pay Syngenta stockholders.[11]
Sinochem merger[edit]
In May 2017, Reuters, reported that discussion had begun regarding the merging and consolidation of ChemChina and state-owned Sinochem, overtaking industry leaders such as BASF, in a deal worth around $120 billion.[19]

        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREGovernment-owned agrochemical firm China National Chemical on Wednesday announced an all-cash proposal to buy Swiss rival Syngenta for $43 billion In a deal expected to improve China's food production.The proposed transaction marks the largest proposed foreign takeover by a Chinese company in history, and represents the latest of several recent acquisitions by the company known as ChemChina.The deal could transform ChemChina into the world's largest supplier of crop-protection products. However, the transaction is subject to approval by Syngenta's shareholders and government regulators, including a federal agency expected to study whether the transaction would affect U.S. national security.Similarly, the proposed tie-up will likely be examined in Beijing as China copes with a slowing national economy and international outflow of capital. China's GDP hit a 25-year low in 2015.Announced as Syngenta's 2015 earnings report showed improved profitability, the deal extends a surge in international mergers and acquisitions by Chinese firms. Deals totaling nearly $68.2 billion have been announced so far this year, more than half the record $112.5 billion for all of 2015, according to data from transaction tracker Dealogic."We are concerned about the need to increase global crop yield while conserving scarce natural resources," said ChemChina Chairman Ren Jianxin as he hailed the deal in a video interview posted on the company's website. He said the planned merger would provide growth opportunity in China, "where there is rapid modernization driven by the need to increase grain productivity and increase food quality."Chris Pultz, a Kellner Merger Investors Fund portfolio manager who leads the firm's merger arbitrage investing, characterized the Syngenta deal as "a vital strategic move" that could help fill China's need to feed the country's growing population by upgrading farming techniques, crop yield and food safety.Chem China offered $465 for each Syngenta share, a 20% premium to Tuesday. The deal, endorsed by Syngenta's board, includes an additional special dividend of 5 Swiss francs (approximately $5) per share if the deal is finalized. Both companies said they expect the transaction to close by the end of the year.ChemChina is headquartered in Beijing and is not a publicly traded firm. Syngenta is based in Basel. Its Swiss-listed shares closed 2.73% higher at 403 Swiss francs Wednesday after retreating from higher gains earlier in the trading session.The deal represents the latest consolidation of the chemical and agribusiness sector following the $68.6 billion merger deal Dow Chemical and DuPont announced in December.St. Louis-based rival Monsanto wooed Syngenta with a roughly $46 billion merger deal last year, but dropped the bid when the Swiss company rejected the sweetened offer. It was unclear Wednesday whether Monsanto would propose a new offer.ChemChina's success in landing the deal marks the latest cross-border corporate foray by the company and its chairman. ChemChina last year acquired Italian tire maker Pirelli in a $7.9 billion transaction.Notable proposed acquisitions so far this year by China-based firms include Haier Group's $5.4 billion purchase of General Electric's appliance business and Dalian Wanda Group's $3.5 billion deal for Legendary Entertainment.USA TODAYChina's Wanda buys U.S. film studio Legendary for $3.5 billionRen Jianxian and John Ramsay, Syngenta's CEO, issued statements saying their deal would further expand Syngenta's presence in emerging markets, including China. They also predicted the transaction would win regulatory approvals. However, Pultz predicted "the U.S will have to weigh in as to whether this is a matter of national security."Federal regulators could seek oversight review in part because Syngenta operates two business divisions in the U.S., Seeds and Crop Protection, and also operates a regional headquarters in Greensboro, N.C.. The company reported $3.4 billion in 2015 North America sales, including the U.S., a 5% one-year decline.Led by the Department of the Treasury, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States conducts national security reviews of transactions that could result in control of a U.S. business by a foreign person or company.USA TODAYSmithfield shareholders OK $4.7B sale to China firmThe agency did not block another major food deal involving China, the $4.7 billion takeover of Virginia-based pork production giant Smithfield Foods by China's Shuanghui International meat processing company.However, Royal Philips NV in January said it had terminated a $2.8 billion sale of its lighting components and automotive lighting business to a consortium led by Chinese company GO Scale Capital because the U.S. agency did not approve regulatory clearance.

News Description









China National Chemical Corp., ChemChina, to Buy Stakes in Adama  China: Adama Agricultural Solutions
Ltd. is a major producer and distributor of crop protection products. The
company is 60% owned by China National Agrochemical Corp. which is a subsidiary
of China National Chemical Corp. (ChemChina). Adama Agricultural Solutions
Ltd.  is expected to merge with Sanonda, an
agriculture chemicals producing company which is owned by ChemChina. This
agreement of an international entity to combine with publicly traded company in
China was possible after the consent of China Securities Regulatory Commission
(CSRC). The shareholders of remaining 40% share of Adama Agricultural Solutions
Ltd., Koor Industries Ltd., has agreed an agreement with China National
Agrochemical Corp. to buy stakes in Adama for about USD230 million. The trading
of Sanonda’s shares is expected to resume back by 4th August 2016, which was
suspended from trading in August 2015. This merger activity is expected to
complete by the first half of 2017. Post this agreement, Adama will run under
its own brand name and management team. 
TechSci Research depicts that
the new entity formed by the merger of Adama & Sanonda would result in a
symbiotic association for both the companies as it would broaden the product
portfolio which would help the company in catering to the customer’s needs in
more efficient and effective manner. 
According to the recent report
published by TechSci Research “Global Water
Soluble Fertilizers Market By
Type, By Composition (Straight and Complex), By Grade (NPK, NP, PK and Others),
By Structure, By Application, By Crop, By Region, By Sales Channel, Competition
Forecast and Opportunities, 2011-2021”, the
global water soluble fertilizers market is projected
to grow at a CAGR of over 5% during 2016-2021, on account of rising population,
growing demand for food grains, and rising concerns related to depleting ground
water resources. Water soluble fertilizers are also being extensively used in
order to increase yield, as they are easy to apply and require less amount of
fertilizers and water usage. Water soluble fertilizers dissolve faster, have a
higher utilization rate and are absorbed quickly as compared to conventional
chemical fertilizers.
