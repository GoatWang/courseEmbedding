President, Acklands-Grainger Inc., Richmond Hill, Ont.

Court Carruthers is the first to admit that dabbling in welding equipment and janitorial and safety supplies isn't the most glamorous business.
The president of Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI) and newly minted senior vice-president of the Illinois-based parent company, W.W. Grainger Inc., also says most people don't know what the company is all about, even though its roots go back nearly 120 years.

But with revenues of $700-million a year, serving 65,000 customers through 155 branches across the country, five distribution centres and about 2,200 employees, Canada's largest supplier of industrial, safety and fastener products is obviously attracting the right crowd.
"We are very focused on selling to industry and government. It's not a glamorous business or industry, but we're all fine with that," says Mr. Carruthers, who held a number of senior leadership roles in the transportation and logistics industries before joining AGI in 2002.
It's as if Mr. Carruthers, Saskatoon-born and Alberta-bred, was going home when he joined Acklands-Grainger. Founded in Winnipeg in 1889, the company grew from manufacturing and supplying wooden goods to making and selling carriages, wagons and farm machinery; when the automobile came along, it added car parts and accessories to its offerings.
In 1996, it was bought by Illinois-based Grainger, a publicly traded company and the largest industrial distributor in the United States. Acklands-Grainger, through vendor partners including 3M, GE and Black and Decker, serves a variety of industries with more than 100,000 products. It also operates a private-label division, Westward Profast'ners, and NTS, a national service and repair business.
"The business is very complex from a logistics and execution standpoint," says Mr. Carruthers, a certified management accountant whose education and training have given him the tools to keep his business wits about him.
With a bachelor of commerce degree from the University of Alberta (1993) and an MBA from Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., Mr. Carruthers worked with Purolator Courier in Western Canada, progressing from sales rep to vice-president, field sales, and moving to Toronto in 1997.
In 2000, he joined Veredex Logistics as senior vice-president, business development, North America, and took on the same role, but as a vice-president, for Dynamex Inc. in 2001.
At Acklands-Grainger, he started as vice-president, national accounts and sales, and moved up. "I have worked for and with some amazing people, and this is really the most important preparation for success - finding, keeping and motivating world-class talent to achieve the full potential of a business."
The devout Edmonton Oilers hockey fan and avid golfer is preparing for a new challenge - fatherhood. His wife, Kristin, a marketing director with Purolator Courier, is expecting their first child in June.
"For me, it is very busy all the time, but only with activities that I like and people I really enjoy being around, both at work and outside."
