Convertible Bonds

Convertible bonds offer the potential for equity-like returns but with lower volatility, combined with the security and capital protection characteristics provided by a bond investment. An allocation to convertibles can enhance your portfolio’s risk/reward characteristics.
We take a fundamental, benchmark-agnostic approach to managing convertible bonds. Our active management style and rigorous investment process offer investors a lower-volatility strategy with compelling alpha generation potential.
Issuers of convertibles range from smaller growth companies to some of the largest, most recognisable companies in the world. Our portfolio comprises a wide spectrum of sectors and credits.

Emerging Markets

For investors, higher secular growth rates and spread pick-up in emerging countries and corporates are characteristics that can offer a compelling risk/return profile relative to developed markets.
BlueBay evaluates historical data, but places greater emphasis on forward-looking risk, which could be driven by socio-political developments, policy decisions, economic data surprises or regulatory changes.
We have invested in this asset class since 2002, and offer active long only, total return and hedge fund solutions across sovereign and corporate debt, in both hard and local currency.

Investment Grade

Investment grade-rated debt typically represents a large portion of the institutional investor's portfolio. This is based on the belief that exposure to higher-quality issuers will result in a relatively low default risk compared to other asset classes, while providing the potential for excess returns over cash.
BlueBay is an active manager with a broad understanding of the investment grade universe in both corporate and government debt. Research-driven, fundamental analysis shapes our ideas. This allows us to construct portfolios that aim to minimise credit risk while seeking to generate compelling returns by expressing investment ideas and themes across the risk spectrum.

Leveraged Finance

We offer a variety of strategies providing exposure to the global leveraged finance markets
Our research-driven, fundamental approach to security selection emphasises capital preservation with a focus on downside mitigation. In our view, the avoidance of corporate decline – and ultimately defaults – is essential to ensuring we achieve our goal of compelling, risk-adjusted returns throughout the credit cycle for our clients.
Since 2002, we have developed a broad spectrum of long-only and alternative investment strategies with varying liquidity profiles. Our expertise and long-standing track record across leveraged finance covers high yield bonds, syndicated loans, mezzanine finance, distressed debt and direct lending.

Multi-Asset Credit

Multi-asset credit provides the ability to capture returns in attractive conditions, while seeking to provide downside protection when markets turn. We believe this strategy represents an attractive risk/return profile.
Our expertise across the fixed income spectrum and diverse investment styles means we can harness ideas across investment grade, global high yield, loans, convertible bonds and emerging markets.
The strategy is managed by the internal Asset Allocation Committee, which comprises a team of senior investment professionals. The Committee meets monthly to make asset allocation decisions, placing a high priority on capital preservation.

History[edit]
BlueBay Asset Management was founded in 2001. The company was initially established to capitalise on strong growth trends in the European corporate and global emerging debt markets.
Today BlueBay is one of Europe’s largest specialist managers of fixed income credit and alternative strategies.
Royal Bank of Canada agreed to acquire the company in October 2010,[2] in a deal valued at £963 million ($1.54 billion),[3] completed on 17 December 2010.[4] BlueBay is currently a part of the RBC asset management division, under the RBC Global Asset Management group of companies.[5]
Operations[edit]
Based in London, with offices in the US, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Ireland and Japan, BlueBay manages over US$55.3 billion (as at 30 June 2016[6]) for institutions and high-net-worth-individuals.
BlueBay manages a combination of long-only and alternative debt strategies covering investment grade, high yield/distressed, convertibles and emerging markets. Their clients are offered a selection of risk/return profiles, from absolute return long/short funds to relative return long-only funds and segregated accounts. BlueBay also has a private debt offering.

Convertible Bonds

Convertible bonds offer the potential for equity-like returns but with lower volatility, combined with the security and capital protection characteristics provided by a bond investment. An allocation to convertibles can enhance your portfolio’s risk/reward characteristics.
We take a fundamental, benchmark-agnostic approach to managing convertible bonds. Our active management style and rigorous investment process offer investors a lower-volatility strategy with compelling alpha generation potential.
Issuers of convertibles range from smaller growth companies to some of the largest, most recognisable companies in the world. Our portfolio comprises a wide spectrum of sectors and credits.

Emerging Markets

For investors, higher secular growth rates and spread pick-up in emerging countries and corporates are characteristics that can offer a compelling risk/return profile relative to developed markets.
BlueBay evaluates historical data, but places greater emphasis on forward-looking risk, which could be driven by socio-political developments, policy decisions, economic data surprises or regulatory changes.
We have invested in this asset class since 2002, and offer active long only, total return and hedge fund solutions across sovereign and corporate debt, in both hard and local currency.

Investment Grade

Investment grade-rated debt typically represents a large portion of the institutional investor's portfolio. This is based on the belief that exposure to higher-quality issuers will result in a relatively low default risk compared to other asset classes, while providing the potential for excess returns over cash.
BlueBay is an active manager with a broad understanding of the investment grade universe in both corporate and government debt. Research-driven, fundamental analysis shapes our ideas. This allows us to construct portfolios that aim to minimise credit risk while seeking to generate compelling returns by expressing investment ideas and themes across the risk spectrum.

We offer a variety of strategies providing exposure to the global leveraged finance markets
Our research-driven, fundamental approach to security selection emphasises capital preservation with a focus on downside mitigation. In our view, the avoidance of corporate decline – and ultimately defaults – is essential to ensuring we achieve our goal of compelling, risk-adjusted returns throughout the credit cycle for our clients.
Since 2002, we have developed a broad spectrum of long-only and alternative investment strategies with varying liquidity profiles. Our expertise and long-standing track record across leveraged finance covers high yield bonds, syndicated loans, mezzanine finance, distressed debt and direct lending.

Multi-Asset Credit

Multi-asset credit provides the ability to capture returns in attractive conditions, while seeking to provide downside protection when markets turn. We believe this strategy represents an attractive risk/return profile.
Our expertise across the fixed income spectrum and diverse investment styles means we can harness ideas across investment grade, global high yield, loans, convertible bonds and emerging markets.
The strategy is managed by the internal Asset Allocation Committee, which comprises a team of senior investment professionals. The Committee meets monthly to make asset allocation decisions, placing a high priority on capital preservation.
