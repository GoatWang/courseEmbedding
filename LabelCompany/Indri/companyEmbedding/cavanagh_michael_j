Michael  Sorich
Attorney 




Biography

Michael J. Sorich is an experienced trial attorney who concentrates his
	 practice in plaintiff’s personal injury trial work and handles wrongful
	 death cases. Mr. Sorich brings a wealth of courtroom experience to Cavanagh
	 Law Group after thirteen years as Assistant State’s Attorney at
	 the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office. During his many
	 years there, Mr. Sorich tried over fifty criminal and civil matters in
	 federal and state court, particularly defending torts and civil rights
	 lawsuits on behalf of Cook County employees. These cases involved catastrophic
	 injuries, wrongful deaths, and class action matters. He also successfully
	 argued cases before the Illinois Appellate Court.
Mr. Sorich’s extensive trial experience has been vital to the success
	 of the cases he has taken on at Cavanagh Law Group. Mr. Sorich does an
	 extensive investigation in all his cases, with a particular focus on cases
	 involving personal injury. In order to gather a broad range of evidence
	 and build his cases to their highest potential, Mr. Sorich delves into
	 each part of the evidence-gathering process. This process includes meeting
	 with consultants, experts in the field, and with clients, as well as visiting
	 the scenes of incidents and taking in-person account of physical evidence.
	 Additionally, Mr. Sorich has excellent client communication skills, as
	 he has spent years representing victims of crimes and catastrophic injuries.
	 Using the investigative and communicative skills he gathered through the
	 substantial amount of time he spent with the State’s Attorney’s
	 Office, Mr. Sorich has made great strides in gathering the most sizable
	 results for his clients.

	At a young age, Mr. Sorich set himself apart from his colleagues. After
	 earning a B.A. from Illinois Wesleyan University, he graduated
	cum laude from The John Marshall Law School, where he was also a member of Law Review.
	 At the State’s Attorney’s Office, Mr. Sorich worked his way
	 up the ladder quickly, eventually becoming the youngest supervisor there.
	 Through his hard work early on in his career, he established himself as
	 a tough, fair, and extremely successful advocate for his clients.


	Outside of the courtroom, Mr. Sorich exemplifies his vast knowledge of
	 the legal field through his written and verbal accounts of law. For example,
	 Mr. Sorich has been a contributing author to the Illinois Institute for
	 Continuing Legal Education’s
	FlashPoints publication since 2008. Additionally, Mr. Sorich frequently teaches legal
	 courses to college-level students.

He is extremely involved throughout the legal community, particularly in
	 the Illinois Trial Lawyers Association and the Illinois State Bar Association.
	 Additionally, Mr. Sorich is a member of two committees within the Chicago
	 Bar Association – the Judicial Evaluation Committee and the Young
	 Lawyers Tort Litigation Committee. Each of these involvements is a testament
	 to the commitment Mr. Sorich has to the legal community throughout Illinois.
Aside from his involvement in legal societies, Mr. Sorich volunteers in
	 his community. He is a Volunteer Soccer Coach with the American Youth
	 Soccer Organization. He was on Catholic Charities’ Golf Committee
	 Board from 2011 to 2015. Mr. Sorich is also a member of the Irish Fellowship
	 Club of Chicago.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
