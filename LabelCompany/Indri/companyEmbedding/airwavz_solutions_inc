Airwavz™ Solutions Names Brad Davis as CEO




Company Poised for Growth with Telecommunications Industry Veteran at 
      its Helm








May 10, 2017 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Airwavz 
      Solutions, Inc., a leading wireless 
      infrastructure company delivering mobility solutions to building and 
      property owners and enterprise customers, today announced Brad Davis as 
      its Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors.
    

      Davis, with more than 25 years in the telecommunications and technology 
      industries, brings to Airwavz Solutions a wealth of experience scaling 
      businesses to become dominant market leaders. Most recently Davis served 
      as CEO of ProctorFree, an online identity and machine learning company.
    

      Prior to ProctorFree, Davis was CEO and President of DukeNet 
      Communications, LLC where he grew the business from 15 employees to 150, 
      and into a $100 million revenue company. After becoming the market 
      leader and being recognized as “Best in Region” telecom provider, 
      DukeNet was acquired by Time Warner Cable (now Spectrum) in December 
      2013 for $600 million.
    

      Mark Horinko, president at Airwavz Solutions, remarked: “Brad’s many 
      years of experience developing businesses in the communications industry 
      will be invaluable to Airwavz Solutions as we continue to build upon our 
      growth and success. He will provide valuable insight and market 
      direction as we execute our short- and long-term plans.”
    

      Commenting on his appointment, Davis said, "Airwavz Solutions is a 
      dynamic organization and I look forward to working closely with its 
      senior-level technologists and strategists, many of whom were my 
      colleagues at DukeNet Communications. Airwavz’s innovative approach to 
      solving building owners’ coverage and capacity issues is redefining the 
      current in-building wireless model and positioning the company for 
      long-term success.”
