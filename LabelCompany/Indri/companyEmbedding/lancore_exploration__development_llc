Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.

Engineering for inventors







 























ENGINEERING FOR BUSINESS SOLUTIONS 
		


 





Inventors

Startup companies and independent inventors rely on Creative to turn their dreams into actual working products. Using our Creative Design Process, we work with our customers to take a project from a concept, through brainstorming, prototyping, engineering, and up to the point of handing it off for production.
 
We offer a 2-hour Inventors Consultation for $585. This one-on-one meeting is tailored to suit the needs of your project. We typically provide “devil’s advocate” evaluation of the idea in terms of feasibility and cost, and often use some of the time for sketching and brainstorming. We also try to answer your questions regarding patents, business models, licensing, the product development process, manufacturing, etc.
