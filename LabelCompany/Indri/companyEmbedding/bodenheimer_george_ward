GEORGE BODENHEIMER





 



George Bodenheimer
    President,
ESPN/ABC Sports







 Bodenheimer oversees ESPN’s massive umbrella of sports 
        properties, which include (inset, top to bottom) Major
League Baseball rights and the signature show “Baseball 
Tonight;” NFL rights; ESPN the Magazine; ESPN Mobile;
the ESPN.com Web site; the American sports-news standard 
“SportsCenter;” and the X Games.


The plan dates back many months, perhaps even a year. Move the NFL from Sunday to Monday. Let hockey go if necessary. And get NASCAR. That was the new ESPN that George Bodenheimer envisioned. That was the blueprint for the next step in ESPN’s evolution.
And sure enough, that’s how things ended up.
When you control the most profitable division of the Walt Disney Co. and nearly half the sports television viewing in the United States when including the venerated ABC Sports division, nearly everything you do has an impact that can be felt throughout sports. Which is precisely why Bodenheimer has risen to the top spot in our second annual Most Influential People in Sports Business rankings.
Bodenheimer has always used that power cautiously and with great deference to the deputies at his side. Lauded for letting his people do what they do best, he is the very antithesis of a micromanager.
But when it comes to the really big decisions — such as whether to spend $1.1 billion per year on the NFL, or $270 million on NASCAR — Bodenheimer sets the table, both with his subordinates and the top brass at Disney.
All seven of Bodenheimer’s direct reports — a group that was shuffled somewhat in an October restructuring — get their share of the spotlight and are often the public faces of the company. But they all are following a strategic vision that is set, and subtly championed, by the mild-mannered Bodenheimer.
“When George sets a goal, he just steadfastly keeps marching forward,” said NASCAR vice president of broadcasting Dick Glover, who was once a top programming executive at ESPN. “That’s why he is so successful.”
There’s a certain level of irony that Bodenheimer would be the most influential person in, of all businesses, sports. Sports is a business dominated by larger-than-life characters such as Phil Knight and David Stern, people who ooze charisma and, some would say, genius.
Bodenheimer would be described as congenial, kind and, yes, smart, but you’ll probably never see him standing in a bathrobe in an ESPN ad.
One could argue that the ESPN brand and Bodenheimer are exact opposites. One is brash, flashy and a little acerbic. The other is deferential, low-key and, well, just kind of nice.
“He’s such a good listener,” said Adam Silver, president of NBA Entertainment. “He’s content to be the most interested person in the room, rather than the most interesting.”
However, when you ask “What is ESPN?,” the answers today point to many things that, quietly, are quintessential Bodenheimer: ESPN is multiplexes of cable channels. Well, that started with Bodenheimer, who is largely credited with the launch and growth of ESPN2 when he was head of affiliate sales. ESPN is multiple platforms. Well, that’s been Bodenheimer’s rallying cry since the start of the decade. ESPN is emerging technology. Well, the new digital broadcast center, ESPN HD, Mobile ESPN — groundbreaking initiatives that put ESPN firmly on the cusp of emerging media — are the sort of things that don’t happen without a president’s personal advocacy.
And ESPN is big-time sports television, with big-time price tags. Under Bodenheimer, ESPN had rights to all four of the major pro leagues for the first time. One could argue that it still has the big four television sports, with NASCAR dwarfing hockey. Add in the PGA Tour, three out of four tennis grand slam events and all but two of the major college football conferences, and ESPN has a dominance that perhaps no media outlet has in any entertainment sector.
Bodenheimer will always lead through consensus, surrounded by elite-level thinkers and deal-makers. Through that bottom-up approach, he leads not only ESPN and ABC Sports, but the sports industry at large.
