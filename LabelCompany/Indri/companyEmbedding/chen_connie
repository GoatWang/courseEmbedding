I70. Moon Palace Sumi Ink
Moon Palace Sumi
The Ink is now in a bottle with a Gold Label

While the packaging is a bit different , this is the highly sought after and highly recommended Japanese Sumi Ink. For both broad edge and pointed pen work. Dries waterproof. A great calligraphy ink.

"I like Moon Palace better, but both Moon Palace and Best Bottle are beautiful inks. The Moon Palace has a slight sheen to it, which I like. Michael suggested this ink to me so please tell him I said "thank you". I just finished a job of 200 invitations with Moon Palace and the ink is beautiful. I did not dilute the ink. 
A client just brought me invitations (slick paper) to address. This bride knew going in to this that I probably couldn't do pointed pen. However, for fun, I tried the Sumi inks and to my surprise they worked pretty darn good. I usually have to use a sharpie on slick envelopes, yikes!!!" 
--Clair F.,  Jan 2011. 

Four sizes available: 

2.0 oz $5.95  (widemouth jar)
6.0 oz (180ml)  $12.95 

15oz (450ml) $19.95 

60 oz bulk bottle (1.8L), only $75.00. 
You save $54.95. 10 six ounce bottles cost $129.50.
Great for teachers, or buy and share the cost with a friend or two or three.

N72. Gillott 303 Nib
N72. Gillott 303 Pointed Nib. 

*This nib is on backorder with the manufacturer. We will not have any in stock until late Summer 2017. We will backorder the nibs if you purchase 10 or more. If you order fewer than 10 they will be deleted from your order.* 

One of the most popular nibs for Copperplate. Good flexibility - not too stiff, not too flexible. Very thin hairlines and good swells. Works for scripts 3/16-1/16". Sharp point, but will work on slightly textured surfaces. Tends to catch on upstrokes. The nib has been retooled to improve reliability and has received excellent reviews.

Mentioned by Eleanor Winters in her Mastering Copperplate Calligraphy (B1109). Satisfactory for Spencerian Script.

N120. Leonardt Principal EF Nib
N120. Leonardt Principal EF Nib

After a year in development, you can now purchase a modern nib that is equal to the best of the vintage nibs. Brian Walker, a respected pointed pen enthusiast, has
worked with a pen manufacturer to duplicate the quality and performance of the legendary Gillott No 1 Principality. The new nib has received rave reviews for both copperplate and Spencerian. It’s flexible and responsive, gives fine hairlines, but is smooth-writing & catches the paper less.
