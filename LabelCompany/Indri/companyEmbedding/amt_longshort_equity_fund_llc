2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Lipper Leader Ratings
 


Preservation Global Long/Short Equity Fund received the following Preservation ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (11,916 funds), - ( funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds&#39; historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds.

Tax Efficiency (US) offers no benefit to investors in tax-sheltered accounts such as retirement plans.

 


Overall Lipper Leaders ratings based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for each measure over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (if applicable) and do not take into account the effects of sales charges for these categories (Consistent Return, Preservation, Total Return, Expense, and Tax Efficiency) as of 30-Apr-2017 out of 194, 11,916, 195, 88 and 195 Funds, respectively in Lipper's Alt Long/Short Equity classification.

Important Information

 

* Volatility represented by annualized standard deviation. Compared to the MSCI World Index, an unmanaged free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. The index consists of 23 developed countries, including the United States. It is not possible to invest directly in an unmanaged index.


Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  Stock values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.  International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.  The issuers of unsponsored depositary receipts are not obligated to disclose information that is, in the United States, considered material.  Investing in long/short strategies presents the opportunity for significant losses, including the loss of your total investment. Such strategies have the potential for heightened volatility and in general, are not suitable for all investors.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  The fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in short-term capital gains or losses that could increase an investors tax liability.  Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.  Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.  Morningstar Analyst Rating™is not a credit or risk rating. It is a subjective evaluation performed by Morningstar’s manager research group, which consists of various Morningstar, Inc. subsidiaries (“Manager Research Group”). In the United States, that subsidiary is Morningstar Research Services LLC, which is registered with and governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Manager Research Group evaluates funds based on five key pillars, which are process, performance, people, parent, and price. The Manager Research Group uses this five pillar evaluation to determine how they believe funds are likely to perform relative to a benchmark, or in the case of exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds, a relevant peer group, over the long term on a risk-adjusted basis. They consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research, and the weight of each pillar may vary. The Analyst Rating scale is Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. A Morningstar Analyst Rating of Gold, Silver, or Bronze reflects the Manager Research Group’s conviction in a fund’s prospects for outperformance. Analyst Ratings ultimately reflect the Manager Research Group’s overall assessment, are overseen by an Analyst Rating Committee, and are continuously monitored and reevaluated at least every 14 months. For more detailed information about Morningstar’s Analyst Rating, including its methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/. The Morningstar Analyst Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a fund, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause Analyst expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what they expected, and (iii) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the fund.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.

Long/Short Equity

What is 'Long/Short Equity'
Long/short equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure, while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions, or the other way around. The long/short equity strategy is popular with hedge funds, many of which employ a market-neutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.

BREAKING DOWN 'Long/Short Equity'
While many hedge funds also employ a long/short equity strategy with a long bias (such as 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their long/short strategy.
Long/short equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography (advanced economies, emerging markets, Europe, etc.), sector (energy, technology, etc.), investment philosophy (value or growth) and so on. An example of a long/short equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund; an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund.
A popular variation of the long/short model is that of the “pair trade," which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector. For example, an investor in the technology space may take a long position in Microsoft and offset that with a short position in Intel. If the investor buys 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 each, and Intel is trading at $22, the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing 1,500 Intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.
The ideal situation for this long/short strategy would be for Microsoft to appreciate and for Intel to decline. If Microsoft rises to $35 and Intel falls to $21, the overall profit on this strategy would be $3,500. Even if Intel advances to $23 – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at $500, although much less so.
To get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison, long/short strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs. For example, if interest rates are rising, a hedge fund may short interest-sensitive sectors such as utilities, and go long on defensive sectors such as health care.

			Congress created the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) as an alternate form of federal income taxation to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporate taxpayers pay a fair share of federal income taxes. Its reach, however, now sometimes extends beyond the wealthy.
		








 What is the AMT? 
The AMT is a tax system that works in parallel with the regular federal income tax system—while some taxpayers use the regular system, others must use the AMT system. The AMT has its own set of forms, rates, rules, and brackets, and requires taxpayers to calculate their federal income tax using this system.
The AMT was originally designed to capture a small number of wealthy taxpayers and ensure that those taxpayers were paying at least a minimum amount of tax. Unlike the regular income tax, however, the AMT is not indexed for inflation. Thus, over time, inflation makes more and more taxpayers subject to the AMT, causing it to extend to more middle-income taxpayers.
 Factors that can increase the likelihood of AMT 

How can I find out if I may be subject to the AMT?




There are no guaranteed tests to determine in advance if you are subject to the AMT. If you were subject to it last year and you have a similar income and tax situation this year, you will most likely be subject to it again.

The IRS maintains a calculator, the IRS AMT Assistant, to help determine if you may be subject to the AMT. Another method is to see what you might owe under the ordinary tax system and compare it to what you might owe under the AMT. The TaxCaster can help you estimate both amounts. If your AMT tax bill is higher, that's the tax you'll owe.


Certain deductions and types of income can influence whether or not you are subject to the AMT. Among the most common factors that can make an individual subject to the AMT are substantial deductions for:

State and local income taxes.
Personal exemptions.
Interest on second mortgages and interest on home equity loans used for purposes other than home improvement.
Miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Medical expenses.

Note that these deductions have the potential to be disallowed or treated differently under the AMT system than under the normal ordinary income tax system.
Other factors that can cause susceptibility to the AMT are:

Earning significant interest income (usually tax-exempt) from certain private activity municipal bonds.
Exercising incentive stock options that are "deep in the money" (on which gain is usually deferrable and taxed as capital gain income).

If one or more of the above factors apply to you, consider talking to your tax advisor to see if you may be able to reduce your exposure to AMT.









Effects of the AMT




Ways You Can Manage Your AMT Exposure









Effects of the AMT













If you are subject to the AMT, your tax bill could be significantly higher than it would be otherwise. Your tax bill could increase under the AMT in a number of ways, including:

You could lose deductions for state and local taxes paid.
You could lose the personal exemptions for yourself, your spouse (if you are married) and any children. This year, the personal exemption is $4,050. Thus, a married couple with three dependent children could lose $20,250 in exemptions.
If you don't itemize your deductions, you could lose the ability to claim the standard deduction. The standard deduction is $12,600 for joint filers and $6,300 for singles.
If you have qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, they are taxed at federal rates no higher than 20% for purposes of both the ordinary income tax and the AMT. However, the extra income could reduce or even eliminate the amount of income you can exempt from the AMT. The AMT exemption amounts are:

$83,800 for married couples filing jointly
$53,900 for single and head of household filers
$41,900 for married couples filing separately

In future years these amounts will be subject to adjustments due to inflation.
If you have certain private activity bonds that are not exempt from the AMT, they pay a slightly higher rate of interest to compensate for the lack of exemption. Therefore, if you are subject to the AMT, you'll have to include interest from these bonds as part of your taxable income.

If you are subject to the AMT, you will need to file Form 6251 and possibly other forms, depending on the nature of your income and deductions.













Ways You Can Manage Your AMT Exposure













If you were subject to the AMT last year or you think you could be subject to the AMT in the future, you can take steps to help minimize its impact. Start your plan now by using the TaxCaster tool; it may help you estimate your potential tax liability under both the regular federal income tax system and the federal AMT system.
Although talking to your tax advisor about your specific situation is always advisable, below are four ways you may be able to reduce or perhaps even eliminate your exposure to the AMT.
 1. Check your tax-free mutual funds and bonds 

Fidelity's AMT-free mutual funds





Money market funds



Fidelity Tax-Free Money Market
Fidelity California AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund
Fidelity Massachusetts AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund
Fidelity AMT Tax-Free Money Fund
Fidelity New Jersey AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund
Fidelity New York AMT Tax-Free Money Market Fund

Bond funds

Fidelity California Short-Intermediate Tax-Free Bond Fund
Fidelity Tax-Free Bond Fund



Interest income generated by most state and local municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax and/or AMT.1 However, if these bonds were used to pay for such "private activities" as housing projects, hospitals, or certain industrial parks, the interest is fully taxable for taxpayers subject to the AMT.
Interest dividends distributed by a municipal bond or money market mutual fund are also subject to the AMT if the fund owns certain private activity bonds. A fund's prospectus will tell you if the fund aims to generate only AMT-free interest dividends. Fidelity offers both AMT-free municipal bond and money market funds that seek to avoid investing in any private activity bonds that generate interest dividends subject to the AMT.
 2. Time deductions and tax payments 
Let's say you aren’t likely subject to the AMT this year, but you discover that you may be subject to the AMT next year. You may want to consider paying your local and state tax bills (including property tax) before the end of this year. You could also group together other expenses for next year—such as interest on a second mortgage and investment and tax preparation fees—and pay them this year. You'll gain deductions that may otherwise be lost next year, and you may be able to avoid AMT in the current year.
 3. Time your capital gains 
Under the AMT, a portion of your income may be exempt from tax. This year, the exemption amounts will be $83,800 for married joint filers and $53,900 for unmarried individuals, but the exemption is subject to phase-out based on income. While capital gains generally qualify for the same lower rates under the AMT as under the regular tax rules, a capital gain may cause you to lose part or all of your AMT exemption.
If you hold securities that are not publicly traded, you may be able to manage this situation by delaying a sale into the next year or using an installment sale2 to spread the gains and potential tax liability over a number of years.
For example, if you have appreciated private securities that would result in a $50,000 capital gain, you might consider spreading the sale out over two to three years, especially if you have other non-recurring deductions that you want to use. Before taking any action, however, be sure to take into account your long-term financial plans.
 4. Be careful with incentive stock options 
Typically, you don't have to include income related to the exercise of incentive stock options (ISOs) when calculating your normal tax liability. With the AMT, you must often include ISO income when you exercise the options, regardless of how much longer you hold the shares received. If you are likely to pay the AMT, consider selling your shares in the same year you exercise the options. That way, you'll at least have the cash to pay your AMT bill. You could also think about exercising a few options at a time over several years to spread out the income and potential tax liability.
Consult your tax professional for guidance appropriate to your specific situation on these and other strategies for managing your AMT exposure.

          1. Municipal bond funds normally seek to earn income and pay dividends that are expected to be exempt from federal income tax. If a fund investor is resident in the state of issuance of the bonds held by the fund, interest dividends may also be exempt from state and local income taxes. Such interest dividends may be subject to federal and/or state alternative minimum taxes. Investing in municipal bond funds for the purpose of generating tax-exempt income may not be appropriate for investors in all tax brackets. Interest dividends paid by Treasury bond funds are generally exempt from state income tax but are generally subject to federal income and alternative minimum taxes and may be subject to state alternative minimum taxes. Fund shareholders may also receive taxable distributions attributable to a fund's sale of municipal bonds. Fund redemptions, including exchanges, may result in a capital gain or loss for federal and/or state income tax purposes.

The Analytic Global Long/Short Equity Fund, L.P. (the “Predecessor Account”) was a limited partnership that commenced operations on January 6, 2014 and reorganized into the Fund on December 12, 2014. The Fund’s objectives, policies, guidelines and restrictions are, in all material respects, equivalent to those of the Predecessor Account. Performance shown prior to December 12, 2014 is that of the Predecessor Account and has not been adjusted to reflect the expenses of the Fund’s Class I shares, which are lower than the expenses of the Predecessor Account. If the Class I expenses were reflected, the Predecessor Account returns would be higher than those shown. However, the Predecessor Account was not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore was not subject to certain restrictions on regulated investment companies. If the Predecessor Account had been registered its performance may have been lower.

You should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus, or summary prospectus, that contains this and other information about the Funds, call 1-888-736-1227. Please read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing.

Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. The potential loss from a short sale is theoretically unlimited since the appreciation of the underlying asset also is theoretically unlimited. Foreign investment entails additional risk from adverse changes in currency exchange rates, lax regulation, and potential market instability. Frequent trading by the Fund may reduce returns and increase the number of taxable transactions. Concentration of its portfolio in relatively few issuers may make the Fund more volatile than a diversified fund.

Executive Summary

Global developed equity markets logged their eighth consecutive monthly gain in June, and ended the quarter with a return of 4.03%, as measured by the MSCI World Index. In local currency terms, international and U.S. stocks performed equally well, but in dollar terms, international stocks rocketed ahead by 6.12% (MSCI EAFE) thanks to big moves in the Euro, Swiss Franc, and the British Pound. Favorable sentiment and advancing markets were largely due to continued strength in corporate earnings, albeit with less than stellar top line growth.

		Glossary





					Objective
The Fund's investment objective is to  generate attractive total returns. The Fund seeks to outperform its benchmark, the Morningstar® Long/Short Commodity Index SM.
    





					Investment Strategy

The Fund invests directly in a diverse portfolio of exchange-traded commodity futures contracts that are among the most actively traded futures contracts in global commodity markets.  The Fund’s actively managed positions will be either long or short (or flat, in the case of futures within the energy sector).  The Fund is not leveraged, and the notional amount of its combined long, short and flat futures positions will not exceed 100% of the Fund’s net assets.
The Fund also employs a commodity option writing strategy, in which it sells exchange-traded calls or puts on commodity contracts.  The Fund sells these options on approximately 15% (and may not exceed 25%) of the notional value of each of its commodity futures contracts, seeking to enhance the Fund’s risk-adjusted return over time.






					Highlights
The Fund may be appropriate for investors seeking:

Attractive total return potential with reduced volatility relative to equity and commodity market benchmarks;
Regular monthly distributions; and
Opportunities to profit whether commodity markets move up or down.







						Fund Structure

						The Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund is an actively-managed, exchange-traded commodity pool. The Fund's shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Fund. The Fund is not a mutual fund, a closed-end fund, or any other type of "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder.

Fund shares are not guaranteed or endorsed by any bank or other insured depository institution, and are not federally insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Shares of the Fund are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


Risk Considerations
Shares of the Fund are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The Fund invests primarily in commodity futures contracts and options on commodity futures contracts, which have a high degree of price variability and are subject to rapid and substantial price changes. The Fund could incur significant losses on its commodity investments. The Fund is not a mutual fund, closed-end fund, or any other type of “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder. There can be no assurance that the Fund’s options strategy will be successful. The Fund uses options on commodity futures contracts to enhance its risk-adjusted total returns. The Fund’s use of options, however, may not provide any, or only partial, protection for modest market declines. The return performance of the Fund’s commodity futures contracts may not parallel the performance of the commodities or indices that serve as the basis for the options it buys or sells; this basis risk may reduce the Fund’s overall returns. The Fund does not presently offer any new shares for sale; existing shares trade on the NYSE MKT. For a more complete description of risks, see the Fund’s webpage at: www.nuveen.com/CommodityInvestments

				*Performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
				results and current performance may be higher or lower than performance quoted. Investment returns
				and principal value will fluctuate and shares when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than
				their original cost. 
				

 
				After Tax Held returns represent return after taxes on distributions. Assumes shares have not been sold.
				After Tax Sold returns represent the return after taxes on distributions and the sale of fund shares. Returns
				do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Market Price returns are 
                based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread on the stock exchange on which shares of the fund are listed for 
                trading as of the time that the fund’s NAV is calculated. Returns are average annualized total returns, except
				those for periods of less than one year, which are cumulative.  
			

				After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and
				do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor’s tax
				situation and may differ from those shown. The after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold
				their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.
			


			 
			Indexes do not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, and no such fees or expenses were deducted from the performance shown. Indexes are unmanaged and an investor cannot invest directly in an index.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's outstanding shares .


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
The 30-day SEC yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the most recent 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period and includes the effects of fee waivers and expense reimbursements, if applicable.


5
12-Month Distribution Rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the fund's trailing 12-month ordinary distributions paid or declared by the NAV price. Distribution rates may vary.


6
All market capitalization numbers are in USD$ Millions.


7
Inception Date is 9/8/2014









You should consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses carefully before investing. You can download a prospectus or summary prospectus, or contact First Trust Portfolios L.P. at 1-800-621-1675 to request a prospectus or summary prospectus which contains this and other information about the fund. The prospectus or summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.





        ETF Characteristics
    

		The fund lists and principally trades its shares on the NYSE Arca, Inc.	
	

		Investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions. 
		Market prices may differ to some degree from the net asset value of the shares. Investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share's net 
		asset value. Shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account. However, unlike mutual funds, shares may only be 
		redeemed directly from the fund by authorized participants, in very large creation/redemption units. If the fund's authorized participants are unable 
        to proceed with creation/redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, fund shares may trade at 
        a discount to the fund's net asset value and possibly face delisting.	
	





Risk Considerations


    The fund's shares will change in value, and you could lose money by investing in the fund. One of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund, fund shares or securities in general may fall in value. The fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio. In managing the fund's investment portfolio, the advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result. There can be no assurance that the fund's investment objective will be achieved.


    The fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies. Equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons, including changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the stock market.



    An investment in a fund containing securities of non-U.S. issuers is subject to additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political risks, withholding, the lack of adequate financial information, and exchange control restrictions impacting non-U.S. issuers. The fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market.



    Alternative investments may employ complex strategies, have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors.



    Shorting may result in greater gains or greater losses. Short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns. Because losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short, such losses are theoretically unlimited.



    The fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in-kind securities. As a result, the fund may be less tax-efficient.



    The fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds, and like other relatively new funds, large inflows and outflows may impact the fund's market exposure for limited periods of time.



    The fund may invest in the shares of other ETFs, and therefore, the fund's investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying ETFs. In general, as a shareholder in other ETFs, the fund bears its ratable share of the underlying ETF's expenses, and would be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other ETFs.



    The use of futures and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset, index or rate, which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives. These risks are heightened when the fund's portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the fund's return or as a substitute for a position or security, rather than solely to hedge (or offset) the risk of a position or security held by the fund.



    The fund is classified as "non-diversified" and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers.



    First Trust Advisors L.P. is the adviser to the fund. First Trust Advisors L.P. is an affiliate of First Trust Portfolios L.P., the fund's distributor.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing.

Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
