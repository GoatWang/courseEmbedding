NOTE A -
ORGANIZATION

BCTC IV
Assignor Corp. (the "Corporation") was organized on October 12,
1993 under the laws of the State of Delaware to act as the assignor
limited partner of, and to acquire and hold a limited partnership
interest in, Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund IV L.P. (the "Limited
Partnership"). The Corporation will assign units of beneficial
interest in its limited partnership interest to persons who
purchase Beneficial Assignee Certificates (BACs), on the basis of
one unit of beneficial interest for each BAC. The Corporation will
not have any interest in profits, losses or distributions on its
own behalf.

NOTE B -
INVESTMENT IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

On
October 12, 1993, the Corporation was admitted as the assignor
limited partner in the Limited Partnership. The Limited Partnership
was formed to invest in real estate by acquiring, holding, and
disposing of limited partnership interests in operating
partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and
own newly-constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income
apartment complexes. The Corporation has
recorded its $100 investment at cost.

NOTE C -
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May
2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding subsequent events, which
was subsequently updated in February 2010. This guidance
established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of
events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular,
this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date
during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate
events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under
which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring
after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the
disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions
that occurred after the balance sheet date. This guidance was
effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods ending after June 15, 2009, and was therefore
adopted by the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The
adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events
that the Corporation reports, either through recognition or
disclosure, in the financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB
amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement
to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated
subsequent events, alleviating conflicts with current SEC guidance.
This amendment was effective immediately and therefore the
Corporation did not include the disclosure in this Form
10-Q.

In June
2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification
(Codification). Effective July 1, 2009, the Codification is the
single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by
the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The
Codification is intended to reorganize, rather than change,
existing GAAP. Accordingly, all references to currently existing
GAAP have been removed and have been replaced with plain English
explanations of the Fund's accounting policies. The adoption of the
Codification did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial
position.

Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial





 



Condition
and Results of Operations




Business


The Corporation was formed for the sole purpose of serving as an
assignor for the Limited Partnership and will not engage in any
other business. Units of beneficial interest in the Limited
Partnership interest of the Corporation will be assigned by the
Corporation by means of BACs to investors and investors will be
entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited
partner of the Limited Partnership, including rights to a
percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and
distributions of the Limited Partnership. The Corporation is
wholly-owned by John P. Manning.

A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus,
as supplemented (the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and became effective December 16, 1993 in
connection with a public offering ("Offering") in one or more
series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 30,000,000
BACs at $10 per BAC. On April 18, 1996, an amendment to Form S-11,
which registered an additional 10,000,000 BACs for sale to the
public in one or more series, became effective. On April 2, 1998,
an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional
25,000,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series,
became effective. On August 31, 1999, an amendment to Form S-11,
which registered an additional 8,000,000 BACs for sale to the
public became effective. On July 26, 2000, an amendment to Form
S-11, which registered an additional 7,500,000 BACs for sale to the
public became effective. On July 23, 2001, an amendment to Form
S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the
public became effective. On July 24, 2002, an amendment to Form S-
11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the
public became effective. On July 2, 2003, an amendment to Form
S-11, which registered an additional 7,000,000 BACs for sale to the
public became effective. As of September 30, 2010, subscriptions
had been received and accepted by the general partner of the
Limited Partnership in Series 20, Series 21, Series 22, Series 23,
Series 24, Series 25, Series 26, Series 27, Series 28, Series 29,
Series 30, Series 31, Series 32, Series 33, Series 34, Series 35,
Series 36, Series 37, Series 38, Series 39, Series 40, Series 41,
Series 42, Series 43, Series 44, Series 45 and Series 46 for
83,651,080 BACs representing capital contributions of
$836,177,880.

The
Offering, including information regarding the issuance of BACs in
series, is described on pages 144 to 149 of the Prospectus, as
supplemented, under the caption "The Offering", which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Description of
Business

The
Corporation's sole purpose is to act as a conduit through which all
of the economic and tax benefits of an investment in the Limited
Partnership are passed along to the investor holders. The
Corporation does not charge any fees for its services and has no
income.

The Limited Partnership's principal business is to invest as a
limited partner in other limited partnerships (the "Operating
Partnerships"), each of which will own or lease and will operate an
apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and
moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the
Limited Partnership invests will own apartment complexes which are
completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation,
or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to
receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected
to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")(the
"Federal Housing Tax Credit"), and provide tax benefits over a
period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which
investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations,
from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for
the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code
(the "Rehabilitation Tax Credit"). The Federal Housing Tax Credit
and the government assistance programs are described on pages 64 to
88 of the Prospectus, as supplemented, under the captions "Tax
Credit Programs" and "Government Assistance Programs," which are
incorporated herein by reference. Section 236 (f) (ii) of the
National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the
making by HUD of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in
properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as
tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly
to the owner of their property, generally are in amounts as to
enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family
income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Limited
Partnership has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD.
HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement
assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment
complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Limited
Partnership is unable to predict whether Congress will continue
rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the
apartment complex.

As of
September 30, 2010, the Limited Partnership had invested in 18
Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 20, 10 Operating
Partnership on behalf of Series 21, 23 Operating Partnerships on
behalf of Series 22, 17 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series
23, 20 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 24, 19 Operating
Partnerships on behalf of Series 25, 43 Operating Partnerships on
behalf of Series 26, 16 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series
27, 26 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 28, 21 Operating
Partnerships on behalf of Series 29, 18 Operating Partnerships on
behalf of Series 30, 26 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series
31, 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 32, 9 Operating

	PART I




	Item 1.	Business



	Organization



	BCTC V Assignor Corp.,




	a Delaware corporation




	(the "Assignor Limited Partner") was formed for the sole purpose of serving as an assignor for Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the "Fund") and will not engage in any other business. Units of beneficial interest in the limited partnership interest of the Assignor Limited Partner will be assigned by the Assignor Limited Partner by means of beneficial assignee certificates ("BACs") to investors and investors will be entitled to all the rights and economic benefits of a limited partner of the Fund, including rights to a percentage of the income, gains, losses, deductions, credits and distributions of the Fund.




	The Assignor Limited Partner is wholly-owned by John P. Manning.






	A Registration Statement on Form S-11 and the related prospectus, as supplemented (the "Prospectus") were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective January 2, 2004 in connection with a public offering ("Offering") in one or more series of a minimum of 250,000 BACs and a maximum of 7,000,000 BACs at $10 per BAC. On August 10, 2004 an amendment to Form S-11, which registered an additional 8,500,000 BACs for sale to the public in one or more series became effective. As of December 31, 2010, subscriptions had been received and accepted by the Fund for 11,777,706 BACs representing capital contributions of $117,777,060.






	The Offering, including information regarding the issuance of BACs in series, is described on pages 161 to 167 of the Prospectus, as supplemented, under the caption "The Offering", which is incorporated herein by reference.



	Description of Business


	The Assignor Limited Partner's sole purpose is to act as a conduit through which all of the economic and tax benefits of an investment in the Fund are passed along to the investor BAC holders. The Assignor Limited Partner does not charge any fees for its services and has no income.




	The Fund's principal business is to invest as a limited partner in other limited partnerships (the "Operating Partnerships") each of which will own or lease and will operate an apartment complex exclusively or partially for low- and moderate-income tenants. Each Operating Partnership in which the Fund will invest will own apartment complexes which are completed, newly-constructed, under construction or rehabilitation, or to-be constructed or rehabilitated, and which are expected to receive government assistance. Each apartment complex is expected to qualify for the low-income housing tax credit under Section 42 of the Code (the "Federal Housing Tax Credit"), providing tax benefits over a period of ten to twelve years in the form of tax credits which investors may use to offset income, subject to strict limitations, from other sources. Some apartment complexes may also qualify for the historic rehabilitation tax credit under Section 47 of the Code (the "Rehabilitation Tax Credit"). The Federal Housing Tax Credit and the Government Assistance programs are described on pages 83 to 94 of the Prospectus, as supplemented, under the captions "Tax Credit Programs" and "Government Assistance Programs," which is incorporated herein by reference. Section 236 (f) (ii) of the National Housing Act, as amended, and Section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965, as amended, each provide for the making by The Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD") of rent supplement payments to low income tenants in properties which receive other forms of federal assistance such as tax credits. The payments for each tenant, which are made directly to the owner of their property, generally are in such amounts as to enable the tenant to pay rent equal to 30% of the adjusted family income. Some of the apartment complexes in which the Fund has invested are receiving rent supplements from HUD. HUD has been in the process of converting rent supplement assistance to assistance paid not to the owner of the apartment complex, but directly to the individuals. At this time, the Fund is unable to predict whether Congress will continue rent supplement programs payable directly to owners of the apartment complex.


	As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had invested in 15 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 47, 11 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 48, and 24 Operating Partnerships on behalf of Series 49.









	The business objectives of the Fund are to:









	(1)







	provide current tax benefits to investors in the form of Federal Housing Tax Credits and in, limited instances, a small amount of Rehabilitation Tax Credits, which an investor may apply, subject to strict limitations, against the investor's federal income tax liability from active, portfolio and passive income;









	(2)







	preserve and protect the Fund's capital and provide capital appreciation and cash distributions through increases in value of the Fund's investments and, to the extent applicable, equity buildup through periodic payments on the mortgage indebtedness with respect to the apartment complexes;









	(3)







	provide tax benefits in the form of passive losses which an investor may apply to offset his passive income (if any); and









	(4)







	provide cash distributions (except with respect to the Fund's investment in various non-profit Operating Partnerships) from capital transaction proceeds. The Operating Partnerships intend to hold the apartment complexes for appreciation in value. The Operating Partnerships may sell the apartment complexes after a period of time if financial conditions in the future make such sales desirable and if such sales are permitted by government restrictions.








	The business objectives and investment policies of the Fund are described more fully on pages 55 to 71 of the Prospectus, as supplemented, under the caption "Investment Objectives and Acquisition Policies," which is incorporated herein by reference.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	 



	 





	 





	As of the end of the period covered by this report, the

	Assignor Limited Partner

	, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner's "disclosure controls and procedures" as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based on that evaluation, the Assignor Limited Partner's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Assignor Limited Partner's disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Assignor Limited Partner required to be included in the Assignor Limited Partner's periodic SEC filings.







	 



	 







	(b)







	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting







	 



	 





	 





	Management of the Assignor Limited Partner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Assignor Limited Partner's internal control system over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Assignor Limited Partner's management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.


	Due to inherent limitations, an internal control system over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.


	The Assignor Limited Partner's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Assignor Limited Partner's internal controls and procedures over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, the Assignor Limited Partner's management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2009, the Assignor Limited Partner's internal control over financial reporting was effective.









	(c)







	Changes in Internal Controls







	 



	 











	There were no changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	 


	To the President and Chief Financial Officer

	BCTC V Assignor Corp.


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of BCTC V Assignor Corp. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. These balance sheets are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Corporation has determined that it is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the balance sheets referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BCTC V Assignor Corp. as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO BALANCE SHEETS


	December 31, 2010 and 2009


	NOTE A - ORGANIZATION



	BCTC V Assignor Corp. (the "Corporation") was organized on October 15, 2003, under the laws of the State of Delaware to act as the assignor limited partner of, and to acquire and hold a limited partnership interest in, Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. (the "Limited Partnership"). The Corporation will assign units of beneficial interest in its limited partnership interest to persons who purchase Beneficial Assignee Certificates (BACs), on the basis of one unit of beneficial interest for each BAC. The Corporation will not have any interest in profits, losses or distributions on its own behalf.



	NOTE B - INVESTMENT IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIP



	On October 15, 2003, the Corporation was admitted as the assignor limited partner in Boston Capital Tax Credit Fund V L.P. The Limited Partnership was formed to invest in real estate by acquiring, holding, and disposing of limited partnership interests in operating partnerships which will acquire, develop, rehabilitate, operate and own newly-constructed, existing or rehabilitated low-income apartment complexes. The Corporation has recorded its $100 investment at cost.



	NOTE C - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



	In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance regarding subsequent events, which was subsequently updated in February 2010. This guidance established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. In particular, this guidance sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This guidance was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods ending after June 15, 2009, and was therefore adopted by the Company for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. The adoption did not have a significant impact on the subsequent events that the Corporation reports, either through recognition or disclosure, in the financial statements. In February 2010, the FASB amended its guidance on subsequent events to remove the requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, alleviating conflicts with current SEC guidance. This amendment was effective immediately and therefore the Corporation did not include the disclosure in this Form 10-K.

	NOTE C - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - (continued)


	In June 2009, the FASB issued the Accounting Standards Codification (Codification). Effective July 1, 2009, the Codification is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by non-governmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The Codification is intended to reorganize, rather than change, existing GAAP. Accordingly, all references to currently existing GAAP have been removed and have been replaced with plain English explanations of the Fund's accounting policies. The adoption of the Codification did not have a material impact on the Fund's financial position.
