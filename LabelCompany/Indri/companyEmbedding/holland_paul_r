In Daly City it's not hard to find facilities that people can go to for medical care or optometry work. But what does make a difference is the physicians that you see. They can either be very family oriented and relaxing or very straight to the point, with what can be perceived as a dry demeanor. Here at Dr. Holland optometry practice he and his staff are friendly and very helpful with all their patients. 

Located down the hill from Seton medical hospital, Dr. Holland's office is in a large building combined with a few other medical practices. The neighborhood is calming and surrounded by apartments and nursing homes for the elderly, which means that the community that he works in is quiet and clean. Being here for years he clearly knows how to serve the community.  

One of the great things about this practice is the fact that they take many different kinds of insurance. Including those from Medi-Cal or for low income families. They also offer discounted rates for those who cant afford the full out-of-pocket price for their glasses. Knowing that glasses can be quite expensive, when adding up the different levels of customization options. This can be a real treat for those who choose this optometrist office. Your glasses are an extension of you and is something that you're going to live with for a couple of years. So it's best to go to an office that specializes in the quality of the glasses as well as personalizing the time they spend with the persons Involved.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Composite Score:





                        The Law Office of Paul R Holland has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
