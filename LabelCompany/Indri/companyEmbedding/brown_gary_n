Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.

In 2016, he published a book with the Daily Business Review (an ALM Media company) titled Florida Construction Defect Litigation.

Delay, inefficiency and acceleration claims;
Public Procurement/Bid protests; and

5 Things To Know About Coloring Gray Hair

What we call white, silver, or gray hair color is actually hair that no longer has pigment.




When covering or coloring gray hair, consider these options and advice from Angie's List members and highly rated hair stylists:



Semi-permanent hair dye options“For locks that are about 20 to 25 percent gray, use a demi- or semi-permanent hair color that's closest to your natural tone to blend away the grays with minimal damage,” recommends Bab May, owner of Bab & Company Hairdesigners of Carmel, Indiana. “Both types deposit color into your hair without ammonia; however, the demi-permanent color uses a stronger concentration of hydrogen peroxide to open up the hair cuticle and inject more color. As a result, demi-permanent color lasts almost twice as long as semi-permanent. Semi-permanent color delivers a rich, shiny color, but fades out in six to 12 shampoos.”
Nonpermanent products can be a good way to get started with dying gray hair, agrees Ceilon Aspensen, owner and manager of Salon Simpatico in Bozeman, Montana. “Semi-permanent color will not completely color gray, but can stain it enough to change your hair color or make it look like a highlight against the darker color,” she says. “After the color has disappeared at the end of six to eight weeks, the client will have a better idea of the possibilities available to them in professional hair color.”

Permanent hair dye“There are some clients whose gray is covered very well by demi-permanent color, but it gets to the point where they get more gray and it doesn’t cover,” May says. “Most permanent colors contain ammonia, which opens the hair cuticle to allow color to penetrate much deeper than without it.”
Angie’s List member Carol Libutti of Lake Worth, Florida began coloring her gray by having her stylist apply semi-permanent dye, but eventually switched. “I’ve been happier with permanent hair color because I spend a lot of time outside, and permanent color doesn't fade as much,” she says.
An online poll of Angie’s List members who color their gray hair found that 71 percent use permanent color, while 29 percent use nonpermanent.



Highlights and lowlights“If hair is long enough, you can try a 'light' highlight, a small concentration of highlights around the problem area,” May says. “Usually gray is noticed most around the area of the part. You can add a few highlights along the part to break up the gray.”
Highlights or lowlights can also keep hair from being monochromatic, causing it to appear fuller, May says. “By choosing colors that flatter your natural hair color, the end result is that your hair will appear to have more dimension. It will create the illusion of lift and movement.”
Libutti disliked all-over color when she first began to have her gray colored. “I thought I looked older,” she says. “My new stylist recommended using highlights. I was very happy with the results and got a lot of compliments.”






When it’s time to reassess your hair dye colorAngie’s List member Kira Stark of Colusa, California says the emergence of significant amounts of gray is a good time to review past coloring habits. “Be honest with yourself. Do you need to be a blonde in your mid-40s or would a more subtle color, closer to your natural color, better suit? Ask your stylist to be honest, too. ‘Is this a good color and look for me?’ ‘What would you recommend?’”
RELATED: Angie's List Guide to Salons and Barbers
Be aware of how color treatment can affect hair. "Any time you apply a chemical to the hair there will be some damage,” May says. “But if your colorist uses hair color properly, there should be minimal damage to the hair.”



How much does it cost to dye your hair?You'll spend more than money when you dye your hair. The process of having hair-color mixed, applied, heat-treated and shampooed can add an hour or more to a cut-and-style appointment. And because hair grows a half-inch a month, re-colorings or touchups are required as soon as four weeks.
“If you get permanent color, you’re going to have regrowth in four to six weeks that will distract you, and you'll want to get it touched up,” Aspensen says. “If you have semi-permanent color, your color will mostly shampoo out in about six to eight weeks and you won't have a regrowth line. Demi-permanent color will also shampoo out — mostly, but not as much as semi-permanent color — in about six to eight weeks, but you will have a faint and indistinct regrowth line.”

        Subject: Reply to Add Highlights /or Not to add Highlights 



Hello, I have  had many clients throughout the years that I have added a weaving of lowlights of their natural color into their silver, or grey colored hair.This technique is used when a client does not want to go from having their natural color ( which is grey), to completely covered with say a medium or dark brown. Or any one process color .This is shocking and not subtle at all. When you choose to use the lowlight technique, I think you will get the  most natural looking color. You do not get a strong root line as you would with other color processes. If you cover all of the grey you will have a root line of a quarter inch that needs to be covered again with in 4 weeks, some woman can get by with 6 weeks between their haircolor appointments. But with this lowlight technique a client can go at least 3 to 4 months in between color appointments. Which is another very big plus when considering this process. My name is Victoria Melton, I have a small salon called Victorias Salon South Park in Charlotte. I have been a licensed and working Cosmetologist for 32 years and I would love to speak to you further about your hair and answer any other questions or concerns you may have . My salon is listed here on Angies List and I offer a 20% off your choice of service when you come to the salon from Angies list. Or come for the Complimentary Consultation I offer . Give me a call (704)430-0715 Thank You...I look forward to meeting you

        Subject: What to do for girlfriends highlighted roots every 4 weeks. 



Hello, My name is Victoria Melton.  I have a salon called Victorias Salon South Park in Charlotte. I have been a licensed and working Cosmetologist for 32 years. I love helping people with their hair. I have been in the business for so long, I have so much information that I have learned, and picked up over the years and I love to share all of it with my clients. Many woman get caught up into this terrible revolving door that is root color. Many dont know how to get out of it either. So I am glad that you have asked. I hope I can help by shedding some light on the subject. I know even I f your girlfriend has thought to herself 'how do i get out of this'  She is wondering how in the world will she ask her stylist why she got her hooked with this haircolor? And what can she do? Seems scary to clients I think. So let me try to explain. So when a woman has her very first highlights ever put into her hair , it is the most beautiful color she has ever seen. And it is beautiful. So if the hairdresser is good she will only put the highlight into her clients hair in a subtle looking way. that is a good hairdresser. Most times i want a first time highlight to look like she has been at the beach a;l summer. When it is done in this way , you will not get a huge dark line of new hair growing in. Our hair grows one quarter inch a month. ok so then the clients is told she should come back in at 6 weeks for her haircut, and they ask do you want to touch up highlights then too? Sure why not, I must need to thinks. client.  This is where it goes wrong. A true touchup for a highlighting is only supposed to be the new quarter inch of new grown hair. AND a client in this position should not need that quarter inch colored again because remember when i said it should look natural. Well if she had gotten that blond over the summer at the beach she wouldnt need to color after 4 weeks, it would just grow in a bit more like 8 to 12 weeks before anyone would notice the darkness at the top. So when a client comes in too early it is very hard for the stylist to only put the color on that tiny section of hair that is newly grown in. That is what a highlight is . But these hairdressers of today are sloppy and badly trained because they take the color and not only color the new hair but they over lap to the existing colored hair. Now she has over processed the hair and by over lapping she has put color over the weaved out hair that wasnt colored last month that is supposed to stay without color on it .Or you would end up with all hair colored.not a highlight! You are supposed to weave like every other hair and leave her natural color as the other hair. So after this happens for about 4 or 5 times/ forget about happens for 4 or 5 years, the client is left with hair that has none of her natural color left in it, except where the new stuff grows in. BAD HIGHLIGHTING,That is why that new 1/4 inch of new hair looks so bad and so dark to girls, because all of the rest of the hair is colored now. Then they sell you on YOU NEED TO ADD LOWLIGHTS FOR 20 MORE BUCKS. Well if it was done correctly this would not be the case, I hope I explained it in a way you can understand . I think I would really like to meet your girlfriend and to see what is going on with her haircolor. I offer a Complimentary Consultation, and would love to show you all what i mean in person. you can reach m,e at (704)430-0715 You can text a day and time you guys or just her are available to come to this number and I will get right back to you. I would really like to help her with this haircolor  thank you Victoria .

I started using L'Oreal Age Perfect almost a year ago and have been VERY pleased with its color, coverage and staying power. It comes with a tube of conditioner that lasts until the next dye. It usually sells for $7.99 at Walgreens, but it's easy to find a $2-$3 printable coupon online.

Henna henna and henna is the solution for no damage buuuuttt... It's a long process to keep it on hair for 4hrs minimum and accept to get it orange the first couple of times wich will have to be each week before you get the right shade and then every two weeks to have no grays , it's amaaaazing for the hair......but loooong process so i'm sticking to permanent coloring every 3 weeks because for me it fades away very fast.... No solution....ahhhhh

        Subject: Permament color 



I started with brown with red hair lights with gray roots. The bleaching process went well and I got a platinum blond. But it slide off after just 4 washings. We went for a more permanent gray chrome color  x2 different brands. Well those slid off in less than 2 weeks leaving me blonde.  My goal is to get a  gray color so my gray blends naturally. But they all slide off after just a few washings lvg me blonde. Help please??

        Subject: To dye...or not to dye? 



I am 57 with 90% gray hair -- some salt& pepper, but mostly white.  I have dyed it for years, as I began going gray in my 20s.  My natural color is dark brown.  I alternately dye it brown, then let it grow out.  I don't look right with blonde hair...have tried that route as well.  I like my gray...but am feeling quite old now.  I honestly will look forward to this color when I'm closer to 70...but want to dye it again for now.
How dark can I go & not look "shoe-polished"?

Hello Betsy,  I am Victoria from Victorias Salon South Park in Charlotte. I dont know if you have already colored your hair with  the all over color? I wanted to answer your post because there is an amazing technique that we can do which is like a reverse highlight . Instead of using blond for a highlight we use your natural color. I weave out pieces of your hair and cover the pieces with a darker color maybe your old natural color. this way your haircolor looks like it did maybee 20 years ago. When you were just having some grey hair through the rest of your natural brown hair. I have been doing this technique for many years and i love it as well as do the many clients i use it on. I offer Complimentary Consultations to Angies list members and I would love to help you with your hair . You can text me or call me at this number and we can get a time for you to come for a consult. thank you Victoria Melton(704)430-0715

        Subject: I am 57 and mostly gray also. 



I am 57 and mostly gray also.  I let it go gray for a while but got tired of being ignored.  I now use a semi permanent color (Clairol Natural Instincts).  I looked at some old pictures of my pre gray hair and went several shades lighter. I would suggest starting lighter than you think you should - it is easy to go darker.  I like the semi permanent color because you don't get a root line when it grows out, but it does fade. However, when I decide to stop coloring I can just fade to gray (sounds like a song title!)

        Subject: Just wondering.... 



Did you find a method that works for you?  I'm in the same boat - pretty much all white now, and still coloring.  At just 52 I'm not ready to go white yet!  My natural color is medium to dark brown and I've been using Madison Reed hair color which makes it healthy and glossy.  However, my hair grows pretty fast and it's not long before I get a skunk stripe in my part.  Then I color my roots and because they're white they don't get quite as dark as the rest of my hair and I end up with bands of color.  Arrrgh!  I've gone blonde (not a good look for me) and done heavy highlighting (not so fabulous either).  Whether I color at home or get salon color, I can't slow the growth of my hair.  I really don't want to recolor every three weeks.  At this point I'm about ready to shave my head!

I lived here for 10 years, then relocated to South Florida. I am now back in this are. I am 58 with about 90% grey. I was fortunate to have a great stylist/color professional in Fl. that owned a simple salon, yet totally upscale results. I also bout Alopecia Aureota which most stylist aren't familiar with. It can also be very embarrassing. Thank you in advance.

        Subject: red haircolor 



Hello My name is Victoria from Victorias Salon South Park in Charlotte. The reason your hair is turning red is because of the volume of developer you are using. You need to lower the volume of peroxide. This is tricky because you want t also cover grey. I would like to see  you come to the salon and let the professionals help you with this . I offer Complimentary Consultations for Angies List Members  you can text me or call me at this number (704)430-0715 thank you
