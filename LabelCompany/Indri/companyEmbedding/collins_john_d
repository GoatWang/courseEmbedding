                           This book is the fourth in the series of Food Safety Assurance and Veterinary Public Health, which presents the latest findings
                              in research on the topics of food safety in the entire agrifood chain from stable to table. The themes in this volume cover
                              a range of topics, including epidemiological monitoring and surveillance in primary production and processing of foods of
                              animal origin, antimicrobial resistance and transfer in these foods, and risk modelling and management strategies. Finally,
                              recent food legislation aspects are discussed. This volume is targeted to scientists in academia and industry, graduate students
                              in veterinary and food science as well as to governmental officials in veterinary public health and food safety. The other

                           A considerable number of pre-harvest factors jeopardise the safety of foods of animal origin. These include factors related
                              to the food animal environment (industrial activity in the immediate production surroundings leading to microbiological or
                              chemical contamination), epidemiological factors resulting from intrinsic characteristics of classical and emerging microorganisms,
                              an increasing degree of chemical pollution, husbandry / harvesting practices (particularly associated with animal feed), and
                              veterinary activities introducing antibiotic resistancy of foodborne pathogens. All of these areas are addressed in this publication
                              by scientists of worldwide repute and affiliated with both Academia and Industry. The involvement of Public Health strategians
                              representing two most powerful tradeblocks (EU and USA) will be extremely important for the scientific community involved
                              in Food Safety Assurance research, as the policies currently set out will inherently have severe impact

                              For the veterinarian, monitoring and surveillance represent the best means of ensuring sustainable animal production at a
                                 time when consumer demands reflect awareness that many of the hazards associated with food animal production can be minimised
                                 or avoided through proper management at the primary production level. Preventive medicine and quality and safety assurance
                                 programmes are primarily based on knowledge of the existing strengths and weaknesses of the clients' enterprise and their
                                 ability to enact effective intervention measures. Accordingly, the food animal veterinarian relies upon effective monitoring
                                 of current performance and herd health status both for the purpose of maximising efficiency of production and providing an
                                 assurance that the primary food product meets required health standards in terms of freedom from those agents of concern that

                              Microbial agents (particularly bacteria) represent the greatest risk to public health. The traditional end-product oriented
                                 food inspection systems are inadequate for identifying and eliminating the usually symptomless animal carriers of agents causing
                                 foodborne infections and intoxications. Modern, risk-based, prevention approaches are the only effective way to reduce the

                                 This equally applies to non-conventional foods containing GMO's. In this publication these issues are addressed by invited

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Collins John D carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Collins John D



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Collins John D



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
