 Milton Friedman and His Moral Perspective

Milton Friedman and His Moral Perspectives

DeMartino argues in his book Global Economy, Global Justice that neoclassical... theory which purports to be value-free is in fact intertwined with normative judgments. Both welfarism and libertarianism, among three ethical perspectives, serve as normative foundation in neoclassical economics, which lead them to embrace free market. The difference is that libertarianism justifies the means of neoclassical economics, while welfarism justifies its end. This...

 Questions on Articles by Christopher D. Stone and Work by Milton Friedman

 What criticisms does Friedman raise against business managers who engage in "socially responsible" practices?  Explain....
Friedman criticizes business managers who engage in socially responsible behavior by using the argument that there is a different set of criteria for social responsible behavior of a person, who happens to be a corporate executive (businessman) versus that same person acting as an individual in a free-society. A business manager’s main responsibility is to maximize the profit...

 Why Has Corporate Social Responsibility Become Such a Prominent Part of the Business World Today?

Why has Corporate Social Responsibility become such a prominent part of the business world today?

It is widely believed that... Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is one of the most important tasks in the twenty century. Some people may consider that companies have always been the profit organizations, and social affairs are in charge by the government, which is a common sense that there are no directly relationships between each other. However, CSR is considered one of the key elements to sustain...

 Explain the view that profit making, via the efficient production of private goods in a market economy, remains the proper and sole criterion of business success.

production of private goods in a market economy, remains the proper and sole criterion of business success.
It seems logical to think that... businesses are set up to sell a product or service with the intention of making a profit. This has often led to the opinion that businesses are singularly driven with profit in mind. There appears to be little room for ethics in this scenario and a negative view of the world of business is often derived from this. However, as it is has been reasoned, the most ethical...
