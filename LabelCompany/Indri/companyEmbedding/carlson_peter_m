I have a 12 week old Golden husky mix so as you can imagine she is not  the smallest pup around. I got the gate to prevent her from going upstairs, I placed it over the first step so it would be tall enough for her to not jump over it. Well I have found her on several occasions up in our daughter's room in the morning and one night I decided to spy on her and see how she got upstairs. This gate has bars that are way to far apart with big gaps. For something that is supposed to keep dogs out, it does not do its job! The last bars on the outside are bent which gives it even more space for someone to get through, I saw my 12 week old 20lb puppy wiggle her way in through the huge gaps on the gate

I bought two of these gates for the two openings into my kitchen. I had help installing them because it was difficult for me to be down on my knees long enough to bend down and turn the knobs for the install. That takes dexterity and perseverance. Once installed I placed my 2-1/2 lb 10 week old Shih Tzu puppy down inside the gates. I went with confidence into my bedroom and looked down and he was with me. To make a long story short he found many ways to escape, through the side openings and also through the bars themselves. The moral of this story is these gates are not for very small puppies. Otherwise they are well made and satisfactory. (I had to put board across the inside of each gate to

This gate does what it is supposed to do. I like how much the tension rods can expand, and it comes with an extension if they can't go far enough. I and anyone in my house don't have a problem with it, but the gate opening is pretty narrow and America's expanding waistline might run into some problems (this is really the only reason I gave it 4/5 stars). I was worried the small door to let my cats through would be too small but it's big enough my dog actually fits through it! My 39lbs Pit bull puppy gets down and crawls through it, but the cats can still get by in places he can't -- those expansion rods made enough room for our one cat to get by on the side between the gate and the wall and our

It was actually pretty funny when we watched him crawl through, so I'm glad the cats are able to find ways around it without the small door open.

                                Great sturdy gate, easy to install

I bought this to go across my kitchen entryway in my apartment so my 2 dogs have a place to stay during the day.  It was super easy and quick to install, no tools required unless you want to screw the pads that come with it into the wall (I didn't because I'm renting -- gate still is solid and can't be budged).  It is very sturdy and quick/easy to open. Love Chewy for providing these products!

















                                Look at Parts Carefully

I am generally pleased by the gate and it serves its purpose in keeping my Tibbies in the kitchen when necessary.  However, I suggest inspecting carefully when unpacking the parts.  There were two flaws in the gate parts I received.  One was a very slight bend in one connector between an extension and the main gate.  I eventually made it work, but what should have been easy-peasy was difficult.  The second flaw was that one of the four openings into which you insert the adjustable spindle rods was too large.  This caused the rod to move up and down in the opening.  I had to come up with a way to fill the opening to secure the rod.  Again, what should have been easy-peasy became time-consuming

I probably should have returned the gate for a replacement but I needed the gate right away.  Now that it's in, it works fine.

These gates are easy to open and close.  Keeps my dogs out of areas they don't belong in.  I have five of these gates.  I don't use the pet door because all three of my dogs are westies and would just go right through it.  My cat can jump over the gate with no problem.

This is exactly what I needed to be able to separate my dog from my cats. Now my cats have a way to escape my 1yr old boxer when he wants to play and they don't. No where else had it and if they did it was way more expensive. I love chewy.com

I got this gate as a gift from my mom. At first it was perfect!  But then my large male pup learned he could conveniently take his teeth and pull the bottom of the door and it automatically pops the top lock wal-la....he opens the gate and ever so sweetly lets everyone out. As long as I put him on the other side of the gate where he can't pull the bottom out it will contain him and his sisters. But then we just recently rescued a 7 month old pitbull pup who can jump and scale it like a gazelle and he doesn't have to get a run at it either he squats down low like a frog and then he is gone. Needless to say I have to stack my dining room table chairs up in front of it to deter him from jumping,

Needless to say I have to stack my dining room table chairs up in front of it to deter him from jumping, but also where my large male pup bent the bottom of the door opening it with his teeth the new pup can crawl underneath the stacked chairs and push the door open with his feet and he escapes. This gate has seen better days, not for smart escape artists. I would say it would be ideal for small pets, but not my Jumper and Houdini.

                                GREAT FOR BLOCKING STAIRWAYS


                            
                                    By BRAUDIS
                                
                            on Jun 16, 2017




If you're looking for a gate to block off your stairs, this is the gate for it. It has two extensions on either side. You can use this gate for doorways as well. I wouldn't recommend this to dogs/cats that are escape artists who may possible jump over the gate or squeeze through it.

















                                Just what we needed


                            
                                    By Murphy01
                                
                            on May 17, 2017




I needed to stop the dogs and my grandson from going down the steps on our front porch so I decided to purchase this gate and I got a great deal at Chewy.  It was the perfect solution and we found it easy to order extensions to make it longer and now we don't have to worry about the dogs running off and having to chase them or the kids either so this has made our life a lot easier and shopping for pet items is enjoyable at chewy.com.

For people who work in the field, most of it is too basic, but there is still a lot of good information in it that even the most seasoned officer can learn from.  I had to have this book for a Grad class, and normally don't write reviews about school books, but this one merits a good word because it is not your typical school book that is only for students.  This book would be useful for anyone involved in decision making for jails and prisons (whether they are in the field or not) and those who want to understand more about why we do what we do.Read more0Comment|

Bondon June 27, 2009Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI would not recommend this textbook to anyone. This book provides very little information concerning corrections. Most of the chapters are filled with ideas and location on where to go look for information. This book was for a graduate level course. I really found it lacking in information and it was not very useful.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsVery useful for my study of the corrections systems and examsByWinfield Walkeron January 14, 2015Format: PaperbackVery useful for my study of the corrections systems and exams.
