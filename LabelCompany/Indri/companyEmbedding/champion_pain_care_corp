Champion Pain Care Corp Adds Management Depth With Appointments Of New CEO And COO






Business Wire




Jun 23, 2015 2:53 PM EDT













 




























































  Champion Pain Care Corporation (OTCBB:CPAI) is pleased to announce that a key component for the future development of the Company has been secured with the appointment of Garland A. Brown, Jr. as CEO and Mark H. Conner as COO. By bringing their knowledge, experience and contacts to the Company, the goal of assembling a high-caliber management team with the credentials needed to accelerate the growth of core operations is now underway.  Garland Brown is an attorney and co-founder of the Scottsdale, Arizona law firm, Weiss Brown. Mr. Brown has focused his practice on emerging technology-based companies, entrepreneurs, and established businesses on a broad range of legal and business issues including intellectual property matters and general counsel services. Mr. Brown's broad and unique experience in the technology field includes 12 years of senior-level positions with Microsoft as both a lead software development engineer and as a Director in Antitrust Law Compliance. His experience at Microsoft, combined with his achievements at Weiss Brown and the international law firm of Greenberg Traurig, has enabled him to provide strategic assistance to numerous early stage and mature technology-based businesses.  Mark H. Conner founded MARS Medical Systems, Inc. ("MARS") and led the strategic direction of the company since its founding in 1984. As Chief Architect of all MARS products, Mr. Conner is a pioneer in the practice management industry by making NetPracticePM™ the first fully browser-based practice management solution in 1999. Under the leadership of Mr. Conner, MARS, acquired by Noteworthy Medical Systems in 2008, again achieved an industry first in 2001 with the introduction of a series of powerful modules for NetPracticePM™. This suite of tools provided the first fully integrated and automated medical coding analysis, appointment reminders, eligibility verification, secure patient Web portal and mobile device charge capture system. Mr. Conner has also successfully negotiated strategic partnerships with several major healthcare industry companies.
