Why We’re Different





1Customized Solutions



2Investment Culture



3Aligned Incentives



4Fiduciary Role



5Our People









Many firms specialize in either Wealth Management or Investment Management. We combine both services to provide each client with a customized plan specifically tailored to meet their financial goals. 




Freestone was initially formed to manage the capital of its founder, who remains one of the firm’s largest clients. Because of this, our investment culture is different from firms that focus only on allocating assets to ETFs, mutual funds, stocks and bonds. We invest across a variety of both traditional and alternative asset classes, letting opportunity guide us. Our investor mindset paired with our knowledge and expertise creates unique investment strategies only available at Freestone.

View Case Study





Freestone's investment professionals are compensated, in part, based on the performance of investments they manage. This creates a powerful alignment of interest between our investment professionals and our clients. Frequently, Freestone’s partners invest alongside our clients with their personal capital.




Some Wall Street firms are not fiduciaries for their clients. Instead, those firms are simply required to recommend investments that are "suitable." This is a subtle but significant difference, and Freestone is proud to operate as a fiduciary for our clients. 




Our Client Advisor and senior investment teams average over 20 years of experience. Many of them earned advanced degrees from premier universities and hold respected industry certifications and designations. Our Client Advisor's broad industry and business experience provides the background to understand the issues our clients face.
Freestone's senior investment team members have a multi-disciplined investment background that includes investment banking, hedge funds, real estate, commodities and trading,

SEATTLE, June 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Freestone Capital Management, LLC, together with its affiliates, the largest shareholder of Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. (the "Company") (NYSE MKT: ORM) today announced that it has delivered a letter to the Chairman and Board of Directors of the Company.
The full text of the letter follows:








June 1, 2017
Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. 2221 Olympic Blvd Walnut Creek, CA 94595 Attn: William C. Owens, Chairman of the Board
Cc: Board of Directors (the "Board")
Dear Mr. Owens:
Freestone Capital Management, LLC, together with its affiliates ("Freestone"), beneficially owns approximately 7.6% of the outstanding shares of Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc. ("Owens" or the "Company"), making us the Company's largest shareholder.  As long-term investors since 2013, we have been patient and supportive shareholders of the Company, watching management's questionable decisions and listening to their promises of long-term value. Unfortunately, those promises have remained unfulfilled and frankly, we can no longer stand by in light of Management's continued destruction of shareholder value. We believe that Management should explore the immediate liquidation of the Company to close the value gap between the Company's current market price and our estimated liquidation value, thereby returning capital to the Company's long-suffering investors. 
The Destruction of Shareholder Value and the Enrichment of Management
The Company and its predecessor company Owens Mortgage Investment Fund (OMIF) has a long-term history of trailing market returns. Based on our calculations, from January 1, 2009 to May 31, 2017 an investment in OMIF/Owens has provided a total return to shareholders of approximately -15.7%, compared to the returns of the FTSE NAREIT Mortgage REIT Index of +161.3% and the Russell 2000 Index of +207.7% during this same time period.
We believe that this enormous gap is due to a flawed business model which penalizes shareholders and primarily enriches Management. Based on our analysis, we further believe that Owens pays above-market fees to its external manager, Owens Financial Group, Inc. (the "Owens Manager"), through a Management Agreement that has been in place for years. Currently, Management makes loans at a 7.5-8% interest rate, borrows capital at a 4% interest rate and pays Owens Manager a 2.75% annual management fee and a .25% servicing fee, in addition to 100% of the loan origination fees and a 100% expense reimbursement. In our view, this explains why the Company, with a tangible book value of approximately $214.9 million, incurred an aggregate operating loss from 2010 to 2016 of approximately $7.2 million. Based on these numbers, we believe the only winner here is the Owens Manager, with the shareholders stuck with an underperforming investment.
Perhaps the discrepancy between the Company's significant tangible book value and its operating loss can be found in the long-term enrichment of the Company's Management, through the Owens Manager, at the expense of the shareholders. In fact, from 2010 to 2016, Owens paid a total of $28,096,070 to the Owens Manager. During the same time-period, the Company had an operating loss of $7,178,271! The Owens Manager's compensation keeps rolling in while shareholders lose money – in our opinion shareholders are clearly losing at the expense of Management. Not surprisingly, the Owens Manager is owned by Company insiders. William C. Owens, the Executive Chairman of the Board, holds approximately 62.5% of the Owens Manager, while Bryan H. Draper, the President and CEO of the Company, and member of the Board, holds approximately 16.3% of the Owens Manager.  
The Management Agreement With the Owens Manager Creates Material Conflicts of Interest and Has an Outrageous Fee Structure
We believe that the above-market fees paid to the Owens Manager are the result of the Company's conflicts of interest with the Owens Manager. The Company itself recognizes this conflict of interest inherent in the Management Agreement, stating in the Company's 10-K that: (i) the Management Agreement was negotiated by related parties, and as such the terms of the Management Agreement were not subject to "arm's-length bargaining"; (ii) the Owens Manager "will face conflicts of interest arising from [the Company's] fee structure"; and (iii) with respect to the Company's personnel, they "will face conflicts of interest concerning the allocation of its personnel's time" due to the Management Agreement. 
Even worse, the Owens Manager does not have the industry expertise to account for its above-market fees. The Company specifically states in the same 10-K that "our Manager's lack of experience with certain real estate markets could impact its ability to make prudent investments on [the Company's] behalf." Further, the Company concludes that it may have to rely on more advisors than just the Owens Manager in circumstances where the Owens Manager cannot reliably make prudent investment decisions: "In those circumstances, OFG [the Owens Manager] intends to rely on independent real estate advisors and local legal counsel to assist them in making prudent investment decisions.  You will not have an opportunity to evaluate the qualifications of such advisors, and no assurance can be given that they will render prudent advice to OFG."
Perhaps it should not be surprising that Management entered into such a lopsided Agreement that favors an entity other than the Company, considering Management's relative lack of skin in the game. In fact, the Company's Compensation Committee, which currently consists of Messrs. James M. Kessler, Dennis G. Schmal and Gary C. Wallace, who made the decision regarding the egregious manager compensation, has a collective beneficial ownership in the Company of only 0.3% according to the Company's last proxy statement filed with the SEC.
Management Should Immediately Pursue a Complete Liquidation of the Company and Return the Proceeds to Shareholders
Unfortunately, the Company seems determined to engage in further lending. During the quarterly earnings call in May 2017, Mr. Draper discussed Management's plan to deploy more capital into loans, despite describing the environment for lending as "challenging". Not surprisingly, making more loans would increase loan balances which would result in millions of dollars in new fees for the Owens Manager and its insider owners, Messrs. Owens and Draper, at the expense of the Company's shareholders. We view the approval of such action as a breach of the Board's fiduciary duty to the Company's shareholders. 
This is a continuation of behavior that has occurred at the Company since at least 2009, and is the reason why the owners of the Owens Manager have received over $28 million in fees from 2010 to 2016, despite the Company's operating loss of approximately $7.2 million over the same time period. After more than eight years of poor returns, instead of continuing to bet on unprofitable and risky loans, the Company should recognize reality and return its underperforming capital to its long-suffering shareholders. The Company should liquidate and thereby close the value gap between the Company's current market price of $16.38 and the estimated $23.50 liquidation value. Quite simply, it is time for the Board to do their job and maximize shareholder value!
Sincerely,
Gary I. Furukawa Founder and Senior Partner Freestone Capital Management

My experience to date has had its own high and lows, but I can honestly say no firm has believed in and respected me more for my talents and contributions to the company. I have had the opportunity to grow my client base with support from my team and the mentorship from more senior advisors/partners. Freestone has a sense of entrepreneurship that allows you to excel if you know where you want to go. I have also been very pleased with the benefits they provide and the support they give to new parents while on maternity leave (and the months back when you’re adjusting to your new normal).ConsFreestone can be a hard place to work if you do not have a good idea of the direction you want to go in your career. We have employees who are very content with their current role and we have employees who look to advance to the next level by advocating for themselves to get there. I would say it would be difficult if you fall somewhere in between. The other thing (and this might be a “me issue”), but I always have a hard time finding information. For example, I never know when we have holidays off work. There’s nothing worse than planning client meetings and then realize the entire office is closed for the day…Advice to Management- Keep your employees happy by continuing to provide great benefits and a fun work atmosphere- Build out a team and structure that encourages others to advance and succeed- Continue to nurture your firm’s entrepreneurial spirit- Challenge your employees to find ways to better our client’s experience with FreestoneShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Freestone Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Freestone Capital Management 2017-01-26 08:48 PST Jun 29, 2016"Recently transitioned client advisor"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Client Advisor in Seattle, WACurrent Employee - Client Advisor in Seattle, WARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Freestone Capital Management (More than a year)ProsI spent 21+ years building a client advisory practice at a national financial services firm and recently joined Freestone after 5+ years of due diligence and firm evaluation on numerous Wealth Advisory firms.1) When the founder(Gary Furukawa) says "put the client first" and "do what is right", it is not just something for the company brochure. This mindset and mentality is constantly engrained into everyone from new staff members to the Partners of the firm.2) Clients truly appreciate the fact that this is a privately owned firm and the owners are not led by some NY based company that is driven to grow firm profits.3) Because Freestone does not look to grow headcount massively and drastically, you end up with a collection of really quality, and truly happy, personnel.4) Bureaucracy is rather common in the wealth advisory world. Not so here. You will often hear the question "how do we get it done for the client?".5) If I had it to do over again, I would have made this move 10 years ago.Cons1) Someone looking to have a place to sell packaged product to the client need not apply2) If you are looking for a firm where you will be able to slide by unnoticed, and do just enough to get the job done, this is NOT your place.3) As in any business, there are issues to overcome and "fires to put out", but everyone here needs to be ready to roll up their sleeves and pitch in to get it solved. This may not be you.Advice to Management1) Continue to grow slowly and add to the firm only people who will put the client first...it is very refreshing in this business.2) This company has a great deal of fun together...make sure that continuesShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Freestone Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Freestone Capital Management 2016-06-29 14:36 PDT Join the Freestone Capital Management team See Our Latest Jobs May 9, 2016"A boutique investment Firm who puts the clients and employees first."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Client Manager in Seattle, WACurrent Employee - Client Manager in Seattle, WARecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at Freestone Capital Management full-timeProsThe best group of talented individuals who work together as a team to ensure our clients receive the ultimate investment and planning advice. I feel empowered as an employee to create my own inspired processes that then likely become implemented across the Firm as management values each of our opinions and suggestions. The Sr. Financial Advisers enjoy mentoring the Jr. Financial Advisers. Opportunities to advance your career in the pathway you choose (there are many of them). A management team who helps you realize your best potential and will mentor/help you get there.Other added bonuses...free lunch delivered to our kitchen everyday, casual Friday's, unmatched views of our wonderful city, a convenient Starbucks in our building (with friendly staff!), office WiFi, great health and benefits package, and a genuine understanding of the need for employee flexibility when the unexpected happen. We have fun here!!ConsThe Columbia Tower parking garage is out of tenant parking spaces, but there are plenty of alternative methods of parking and commuting to and from the office! The elevators to the 74th floor take a total of 4 minutes and my ears pop every time, but the view is unmatched and your ears quickly adjust.Advice to ManagementContinuing to listen, create, and build the culture that we have. Without the current management team, we wouldn't have the thriving atmosphere of hard-working, motivated, and fun people that we do!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Freestone Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Freestone Capital Management 2016-05-09 14:19 PDT Oct 21, 2015 Helpful (2)"Positive Trajectory - Meaningful Path"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Client Manager in Seattle, WACurrent Employee - Client Manager in Seattle, WARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Freestone Capital Management full-time (More than a year)ProsFreestone is a company where, if you are willing to work hard and have a positive attitude, you can truly make a difference in the day-to-day and long term company success. Based on my personal experience, upper management is interested in setting a path (based on your personal goals and what you have shown them) and making meaningful steps to achieving that path. I feel valued here. At Freestone, if you are a problem solver, innovative, determined and can work well in a team environment, you will find you are absolutely not a cog in the larger machine (like so many larger companies - I worked at a 1500 person firm before arriving here). The employee benefits are top of the line. The people generally enjoy being around each other and can go out together and have fun at the end of the workday. The people I have worked with embrace the "Client First" attitude and always consider that first in decision making. Fun and loose environment focused on making the company better, which inspires me on a day-to-day basis. The office is bright with natural light and has a great view. Upper management is investing in younger people to take over the company in the future.ConsTo do what is necessary for the company to succeed, you must be willing to work - and sometimes work long hours to make this happen. If you are looking for a 35-40 hour work week, this is not the place for you - however I see this as a symptom of the industry and American work/life balance in general, not specifically Freestone. I see it as a learning experience and variety of workflow (keeping it interesting), but some people view the fact that employees "wear multiple hats" or are responsible for many tasks as a negative (see comments about being a cog above - I think it is important to do many things and learn the company from inside).Advice to ManagementContinue on this trajectory. It seems we have had one turbulent event after another, paired with much turnover, but I feel good about the team we have in place and hope we can keep rolling forward. Let's continue to make this a top flight professional environment we can be proud of. Seems culture is rebuilding itself with some old and some new, let's embrace that.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Freestone Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Freestone Capital Management 2015-10-21 16:41 PDT Sep 22, 2015 Helpful (1)"Small firm flexibility with big firm capabilities"StarStarStarStarStarCurrent Employee - Director in Seattle, WACurrent Employee - Director in Seattle, WAI have been working at Freestone Capital Management part-time (More than a year)ProsI am grateful and proud to work at Freestone, and feel defensive about some of the reviews. I was drawn initially to the firm because they are delivering investment solutions clients can't get access to elsewhere. The advisors really care about their clients and the founder prides himself on being ethical in a way most people in this industry is not. Aligning myself to that in this industry is extremely important to me.Personally, I recently had a health issue that left me struggling for over six months. They were gracious and provided me a lot of compassionate flexibility. The teams pulled together to cover for me and as I returned, offered me a flexible work schedule while I get back on my feet. They also met with me to determine "the highest and best use of my time", giving consideration to my career goals in a way most big firms cannot. I am a working mother with a need for flexibility during this life stage. It's something they recognize, appreciate, and have been willing to work around.ConsOver the last few years, there has been a tremendous amount of turnover. Some of it was hard to get through, and has left morale fragile. Aside from heartbreaking departures, the firm has simultaneously moved, changed IT systems, and reorganized everything. The culture has shifted tremendously in the last two years, which has its pros and cons.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Freestone Capital Management Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Freestone Capital Management 2015-09-22 15:18 PDT Aug 7, 2015 Helpful (1)"Growing company!"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Washington in Seattle, WACurrent Employee - Washington in Seattle, WARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsA+ management team, path development, growth oriented, free lunch, excellent benefit package, generous 401K match, young employees, clients come first.Freestone is an exciting place to work.

5Our People









Many firms specialize in either Wealth Management or Investment Management. We combine both services to provide each client with a customized plan specifically tailored to meet their financial goals. 




Freestone was initially formed to manage the capital of its founder, who remains one of the firm’s largest clients. Because of this, our investment culture is different from firms that focus only on allocating assets to ETFs, mutual funds, stocks and bonds. We invest across a variety of both traditional and alternative asset classes, letting opportunity guide us. Our investor mindset paired with our knowledge and expertise creates unique investment strategies only available at Freestone.

View Case Study





Freestone's investment professionals are compensated, in part, based on the performance of investments they manage. This creates a powerful alignment of interest between our investment professionals and our clients. Frequently, Freestone’s partners invest alongside our clients with their personal capital.




Some Wall Street firms are not fiduciaries for their clients. Instead, those firms are simply required to recommend investments that are "suitable." This is a subtle but significant difference, and Freestone is proud to operate as a fiduciary for our clients. 




Our Client Advisor and senior investment teams average over 20 years of experience. Many of them earned advanced degrees from premier universities and hold respected industry certifications and designations. Our Client Advisor's broad industry and business experience provides the background to understand the issues our clients face.
Freestone's senior investment team members have a multi-disciplined investment background that includes investment banking, hedge funds, real estate, commodities and trading,
