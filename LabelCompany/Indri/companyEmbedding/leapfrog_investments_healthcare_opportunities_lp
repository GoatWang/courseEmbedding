Enabling leaps of growth, profitability and impact




LeapFrog brings distinctive operational experience and advisory support to partner companies.
 
                    

        Share this page:    























LeapFrog invests capital, people and knowledge in purpose-driven businesses, helping them to grow, to be profitable and to have real social impact.
This is how we achieve top-tier returns for our investors. And how we enable striving emerging consumers to propel themselves into prosperity and security. This is a synergy, not a trade-off.
We aim to open the gates of the capital markets for high growth businesses – bringing large-scale capital to drive rapid impact on billions of lives. We are interested in both scale and diversification. We like building big businesses that succeed and endure.
We think of ourselves always as co-owners – alongside our investors, co-investors, management and local communities. We work hard to have a deep relationship with all these partners.
We bring distinctive operational experience and advisory support to partner companies to make a game changing difference in their financial and social performance. Our team has a substantial proportion of operators and experts.
Ultimately, we hope that the philosophy and strategy of profit with purpose will be adopted by a diverse and large number of institutions. And that we will be replicated by a hundred LeapFrogs.

Building the team
 Founding story: Five guys in a Volvo
LeapFrog founders Andy Kuper and Jim Roth tell the story of how they founded LeapFrog and built the team with strong operational skills and experience.



LeapFrog “has sought to change the way we invest as individuals, institutions and societies.”
Economist Ideas Summit

 
 
“LeapFrog’s team is widely recognised as having opened up a new frontier … for alternative investing”
President Bill Clinton

GROWTH
$10M – $50M
Typical capital investment






How we invest and build




LeapFrog invests in high-growth, purpose-driven businesses in some of the world’s fastest growing markets
 
                    

        Share this page:    























LeapFrog makes private equity investments in high-growth, purpose-driven financial services businesses in some of the world’s fastest growing markets. We typically invest between $10m and $50m in capital, and we actively invest our knowledge and experience. This enables LeapFrog companies to achieve new levels of growth, profitability and impact. We look for investee companies that are strongly aligned with our values, and whose potential scale, client focus and governance mean they will grow and endure.
A LeapFrog investment is a commitment to partnership. We stand side-by-side with the leadership of the businesses we back. Our deal teams include former CEOs and senior executives from emerging markets, so they understand the promise and the pitfalls of growing a business.

Value creation
Working alongside our deal teams, LeapFrog’s dedicated value creation specialists bring deep operational and management experience that enable our companies to achieve their ambitious visions. The toolkit they share is extensive, and includes:

Strategy and governance
Together with management, we create robust business strategies, governance structures, strategic planning, and financial and social performance management.
Product, pricing and revenue
We help design affordable, relevant and quality products, always built with the emerging consumer at the centre.
Sales and distribution
We bring to bear deep technical expertise in sales and distribution, integrating new technologies with traditional approaches.
Core operations
LeapFrog helps to structure the efficiency and effectiveness of core operations and processes.
Human resources and talent management
We help to recruit, retain and develop world-class senior talent, drawing on our global networks.
Technology and data
We create technology and data strategies and capabilities that lead to higher performance in core operations and an even better customer experience.
Measurement
We introduce LeapFrog’s insightful measurement framework, FIIRM, which integrates financial, impact, innovation and risk management metrics and helps management to drive with a dashboard.

Once we have helped set a partner company on a transformative path of growth LeapFrog aims to exit the investment via IPO, trade sale, a sale back to a partner, or a management buyout. Our responsible exit approach aims to leave an enduring profit with purpose legacy.


“LeapFrog’s innovative approach to democratising insurance — by investing in financial services companies serving Africa and Asia — [is reaching] millions from low-income and socially excluded backgrounds.”
Richard Branson
Screw Business as Usual

Consumer insights




At the heart of LeapFrog’s focus on the emerging consumer opportunity is a deep understanding of the needs and preferences of these consumers in multiple markets. This is underpinned by research.
 
                    

        Share this page:    























“Emerging consumers work hard to achieve their dreams, and they are sophisticated at managing risk,” says Raghu Kolli, LeapFrog’s Head of Consumer Insights and Innovation.
“They’re highly motivated to leapfrog into the organised economy, but they need access to the right springboards and safety nets – tools like insurance, education, healthcare.”
Across Africa and Asia, some two billion emerging consumers are seeking access to vital tools that help build secure and sustainable livelihoods.
LeapFrog works closely with its partner companies to deepen their understanding of consumer needs. Through human-centered design processes, LeapFrog helps them deliver relevant, affordable and quality products.
Head of Impact Sam Duncan explains that LeapFrog sees low-income people as active agents of their futures. “This enables our portfolio companies to improve products, design relevant features, reach more people, and enhance customer value,” she says.

OPIC commits up to $200m to LeapFrog Investments




“A transformative moment for impact investing”

10 December 2015 – London and Washington DC 
LeapFrog Investments is set to receive up to $200m from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the OPIC Board of Directors announced today. This is the largest commitment in history to any impact fund manager. It also brings commitments to LeapFrog to over 1 billion USD, heralding the arrival of the first billion-dollar group dedicated to equity impact investing. 
LeapFrog plans to invest the capital in financial services and healthcare companies, in both Africa and emerging Asia. By focusing on these underserved markets, LeapFrog portfolio companies recorded a 60% average revenue growth last year, and now serve 51.8 million people.
Elizabeth Littlefield, President and CEO of OPIC, said “LeapFrog’s innovative approach paired with sound commercial performance has helped spark high-impact business activity in emerging markets. Today millions more people across the developing world have access to financial tools, and tens of thousands have jobs because of fast-growing companies supported by LeapFrog. I look forward to the results of OPIC’s support to this exciting fund manager.”
Leading US investors in LeapFrog’s funds to date include AIG, J.P. Morgan, MetLife, Prudential Financial, RGA, and TIAA-CREF. Global investors in LeapFrog include Alliance Trust, AXA, HESTA, Partner Re, Swiss Re, XL Catlin and Zurich. 
Many sophisticated investors are joining the move towards what LeapFrog terms “profit with purpose” investment strategies. U.S. pension plans and endowments in particular saw a recent shift in U.S. policy to enable them to consider a wider range of investment opportunities, combining financial reward and impact. 
“This commitment marks a transformative moment for impact investing,” said Dr. Andrew Kuper, Founder and CEO of LeapFrog. “OPIC’s vision and capital are a magnet for other leading institutions, revealing how to invest in companies that reach billions of underserved consumers. The greatest financial and social opportunity of our era is to serve these real needs, tapping vast new markets, and achieving profit with purpose.” 
The World Bank estimates that over 4 billion people worldwide are earning under $10 per day Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This population is rising toward the middle class, but lacks access to essential financial tools and healthcare services. 
Recognizing the power of the private sector to serve these needs, development finance institutions including the EIB, IFC, FMO, KfW/ DEG and Proparco were all early investors in LeapFrog. 
OPIC’s historic commitment to LeapFrog marks a new level of recognition for the private sector as a source of social change. Since launching with President Clinton in 2009, LeapFrog has emphasized the need for scale and strong returns in impact investing. 


“LeapFrog’s innovative approach paired with sound commercial performance has helped spark high-impact business activity in emerging markets… I look forward to the results of OPIC’s support to this exciting fund manager.”
Elizabeth Littlefield, President and CEO of OPIC

LeapFrog Investments Hops into Africa Healthcare
The latest venture of the pioneering impact-investing firm: healthcare delivery in East Africa.

Thomas Verghese, an associate director at LeapFrog and leader on their investments team, spoke at a Harvard Business School healthcare conference about rising consumer demand in emerging markets. Photo courtesy of Harvard Business School
Since launching ten years ago with an endorsement from former President Bill Clinton, LeapFrog Investments has shown how a profit-with-a-purpose fund can be sustained by providing financial services to consumers in Africa and Asia who make as little as US$2 a day. Now the billion-dollar-plus private equity company, which focuses on high-growth, purpose-driven businesses in fast-growing markets, has taken a stake in its first healthcare business by investing US$22 million for a majority stake in a Kenyan pharmacy chain.
The move into healthcare is yet another example of development “leapfrogging” — that is, bypassing traditional technologies or systems in favor of new ones that may accelerate progress. It’s also a logical step for LeapFrog, says Thomas Verghese, an associate director at LeapFrog and leader of their investment team. “Half of our existing portfolio companies in the financial services space have some sort of health product or managed care offering,” he notes.
As a result, LeapFrog created a healthcare investment fund and assembled a team of nine people, including physicians, to explore healthcare investment opportunities. A deal with Goodlife Pharmacy was cemented in November 2016, and represents the largest direct investment in the East Africa retail pharmacy sector to date.
LeapFrog’s interest in Goodlife is based on the key role pharmacies play in providing consumer healthcare services across Kenya and East Africa. Goodlife currently sells drugs and wellness products to more than 700,000 customers from 25 different locations across East Africa, and plans to expand its footprint to more than 100 stores over the next five years, according to Verghese. 
The Goodlife deal dovetails with LeapFrog’s mission of investments in companies that provide financial products, such as insurance, savings, pensions or credit, to the two to three billion consumers who are moving into the middle class in the developing world. The Goodlife deal also represents a potentially lucrative area: Kenya’s pharmacy sector is worth US$725 million and set to rise to US$1.3 billion by 2020, estimates LeapFrog. 
Drug prices are currently at an all-time low in Kenya, but access to medication can still be an issue. One problem is counterfeit drugs. Another is that hospital pharmacies are often overwhelmed with long lines or running out of medications. To get around these problems, many consumers self-diagnose and then go to a pharmacy as a first point of care. At Goodlife, trained pharmacists help consumers avoid misdiagnosis by providing basic medical advice and performing simple diagnostics such as blood pressure checks. Goodlife Pharmacy is also moving into telemedicine, allowing rural and peri-urban consumers access to medical care on-site virtually, avoiding a long trip to the hospital.
LeapFrog’s healthcare team also focus on opportunities in single-specialty services, like ophthalmology and cardiology, noting regional challenges in subsectors such as standalone primary care clinics. “Investors have traditionally struggled with primary care,” explained Verghese, pointing to challenges within the subsector, such as relatively low unit economics, referral dynamics, and difficulties in achieving the patient volumes necessary to sustain operations.
Another area of future focus for LeapFrog in Africa healthcare will be managing chronic disease, says Verghese, who spoke at a Harvard Business School conference on healthcare in February 2017. “The continent has seen the rise of non-communicable diseases, so we’re no longer looking just at the Africa of Malaria, HIV and tuberculosis,” he says. “This shift will drive the need for comprehensive, longer-term care with many touch points for consumers to access care conveniently and affordably.”
LeapFrog was launched in 2008 with a first fund valued at US$130 million. Its primary focus has been on customers typically earning under US$10 a day; LeapFrog estimates that worldwide, the annual collective spending power of such customers will rise from around US$2 trillion in 2012 to US$5 trillion by 2022. “There’s a large basket of essential services that emerging consumers still don’t have access to, whether that’s financial services, healthcare, power, or clean running water,” Verghese says. “The future is to one day provide the emerging consumer with a full basket of these essential services.”
Healthcare is an important next step in that direction for emerging market consumers. “Rising incomes, heightened consumer awareness, and expanding insurance penetration are increasing the demand for quality care,” Verghese says, specifically noting the large upswing in demand for more specialist care, as compared to traditional generalist providers. But healthcare delivery companies that wish to serve low- and middle-income segments must find ways to cut prices while maintaining quality of care and positive patient outcomes if they hope to stay profitable. Verghese points to innovative delivery models as the solution. “One example we’ve seen,” he says, “is an Indian cardiology hospital that offers traditional bypass surgeries for US$2,000, versus the US$100,000 ballpark charged in the U.S., but with lower mortality and infection rates.”
Apparently, development leapfrogging has its advantages.

LeapFrog Investments names Olale, Fernandes to lead healthcare expansion


February 18, 2016
By Stephanie Rogan
 Follow @stephanierogan





LeapFrog Investments, a “profit-with-purpose” emerging markets private equity firm, named two partners to spearhead the firm’s expansion into healthcare investments. Dr. Felix Olale, MD, PhD, who joins LeapFrog as a partner, will lead African healthcare investments. Dr. Olale was previously the chairman of the Excelsior Group, a US and Kenyan-based advisor and developer of healthcare systems. Asian healthcare investments will be led by LeapFrog partner and co-head of Asia, Michael Fernandes. Prior to joining LeapFrog, Michael managed Khazanah Nasional Berhad’s healthcare portfolio
PRESS RELEASE
London & Johannesburg, 18 February 2016 – LeapFrog Investments today announced the leaders of a global team to spearhead the firm’s expansion into healthcare investments. LeapFrog’s companies so far serve 52 million people across 21 markets with financial services, and the firm intends to achieve similar large-scale results in healthcare. This announcement follows OPIC’s recent announcement of a commitment to LeapFrog of up to $200m for investments in healthcare and financial services.
African healthcare investments will be led by Dr. Felix Olale, MD, PhD, who joins LeapFrog as a Partner. Dr. Olale is an entrepreneur, innovator and physician-scientist with wide experience building businesses and investing in healthcare across Africa. He has led and advised on over $100 million of healthcare investments across Africa. Before joining LeapFrog, Dr. Olale was previously the Chairman of the Excelsior Group, a US and Kenyan-based advisor and developer of healthcare systems. He also co-founded Wellness Group, a specialty consultation and medical diagnostics company. His experience with private equity and healthcare spans across Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. 





Asian healthcare investments will be led by LeapFrog Partner and Co-Head of Asia, Michael Fernandes. Prior to joining LeapFrog, Michael managed Khazanah Nasional Berhad’s healthcare portfolio, consolidated under IHH Healthcare and listed in Singapore for a $7 billion valuation. He also led the $250 million global custom manufacturing business for the Piramal Healthcare Group, focusing on global acquisitions, business development, supply chain management and talent. He too has served on diverse boards including for the likes of IDFC and Apollo Hospitals.
Dr. Andrew Kuper, Founder and CEO of LeapFrog, said “These two healthcare leaders have a distinctive combination of experience as investors, operators, advisors and medical innovators. They have successfully executed at the highest level and across several continents. LeapFrog aims to generate the same extraordinary results in Healthcare as we have in Financial Services. These formidable leaders have what it takes to achieve those high ambitions, shaping industries and changing lives.”
Four expert roles on the global Healthcare team were also announced.
Matthew Myers, Director at LeapFrog and a qualified actuary, will play a core role, leading thinking on health insurance into healthcare. Previously, at Health Monitor Company, South Africa’s largest independent actuarial healthcare consultancy, Matthew advised private health insurance schemes and employers on pricing and product development and the management of healthcare funding. 





Tom Verghese, an Associate Director, will play a pivotal role in Africa investments. He previously focused on healthcare transactions for CDC and for Excelsior Group, where he was part of transactions teams, and advised leading private equity firms focused on Africa.
Kavitha Subramanian, also an Associate Director, will be central to Asian investments. Previously at Actis, she focused on healthcare transactions in South Asia, including significant investments in Symbiotec Pharmalab and Asiri Hospitals. Prior to this, she focused on healthcare at McKinsey & Company.
LeapFrog also recently hired Roshni Bandesha, charging her with measurement, reporting, and insights into Healthcare globally. She was previously a Senior Research Analyst at McKinsey & Co in New Delhi, where she covered healthcare across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and co-wrote a field-defining global health advocacy report.
Healthcare in emerging markets remains both a pressing social need, and a major market opportunity. Figures from the World Health Organization show the difference in the Healthy Life Expectancy (HLE) in emerging countries compared to economically more developed ones: Luxembourg has a 72 years HLE; India 58 years; Ghana 54 years; Kenya 53 years; South Africa 52 years; and Nigeria just 47 years.
The World Bank estimates that over 4 billion people worldwide are earning under $10 per day Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). This population is rising toward the middle class, but lacks access to essential services like healthcare. LeapFrog is uniquely positioned to serve this demand, with deep team specialisation in both healthcare provision and financial services, a track record of success in delivering relevant and affordable products to emerging consumers, and a wealth of data and insights on the emerging consumer market. 





About Dr Felix Olale, MD, PhD
Dr. Felix Olale is an entrepreneur, innovator, physician-scientist and advisor, renowned for his work building businesses and investing in healthcare in emerging markets. Felix has led and advised on transactions of more than $100 million in financing across Africa.
Prior to Leapfrog, Dr. Olale was Executive Chairman of the Excelsior Group, a US and Kenyan-based advisor in emerging markets. While at Excelsior he co-founded Wellness Group, a specialty consultation and medical diagnostics company. Dr. Olale was also a founding member of the Healthcare Advisory Board for Safaricom, the leading Kenyan telecommunications and mobile money operator.
Dr. Olale began his career as a physician-scientist at Skirball Institute of Bio-molecular Medicine in New York, where he cloned two genes involved in organ patterning and regeneration. He also worked as a venture capital analyst at New York University’s Office of Industrial Liaison and Applied Research Fund. Later, he was an Associate Partner and a leader in the Pharmaceutical, Medical Products and Global Health practices at McKinsey & Company in New York.
Dr. Olale holds a Bachelor of Arts, in Molecular Biology, with honors, from the University of Pennsylvania where he was a University Scholar. He received his Medical Degree and Doctorate from NYU School of Medicine. He holds a number of board appointments, including chairing the Governance Committee of PATH, the leading global health innovator, and chairing the Advisory Board of the Institute for Healthcare Management at Strathmore Business School in Nairobi. 





About Michael Fernandes
With 20 years of experience in operations, consulting and investing, Michael co-leads LeapFrog’s work in South and Southeast Asia. Michael has led several of LeapFrog’s landmark investments, including IFMR Capital in India and Reliance in Indonesia.
The former Country Head for India for Khazanah Nasional, Michael led the global healthcare team, also focusing on financial services and infrastructure. Michael was responsible for over $700 million of investments in India, including Yes Bank, L&T Finance and Uniquest; and served on the boards of IDFC and Apollo Hospitals. He managed the Khazanah healthcare portfolio, ranging from hospitals to health insurance providers, that was consolidated under IHH Healthcare and listed in Singapore for a $7 billion valuation.
Previously, Michael led the $250 million global custom manufacturing business for the Piramal Healthcare Group, focusing on global acquisitions, business development, supply chain management and talent.

LeapFrog Investments is a private investment firm that invests in high-growth financial services and healthcare companies in emerging markets. The firm's investments have an annual growth rate of more than 40% and its companies reach approximately 93.4 million consumers,[4] primarily in Africa and Asia.[5]
LeapFrog has attracted over $1 billion from global investors since inception, including funds from investors such as Prudential Financial,[2] Swiss Re,[6] JP Morgan, TIAA-CREF[7] and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's Omidyar Network.[8][9][10]
LeapFrog was founded in January 2007 by Andrew Kuper and officially launched in 2008 by former US President Bill Clinton who endorsed the firm for opening new frontiers for alternative investments.[11][12]
According to The Economist, LeapFrog is a well-established impact investing firm.[13] The firm has invested in companies such as BIMA, a fintech business that provides services including mobile insurance to 20 million low income customers in Asia, Africa and Latin America,[4][14] India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers, a leading Indian insurance broker and part of Mahindra Group, and Kenyan retail pharmacy chain Goodlife.[11]
LeapFrog owns significant stakes in companies in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia and India.[15] It raised its first fund of $135 million in 2009 to invest in insurance and related financial services companies.[16] In September 2013, LeapFrog Investments launched its second fund, raising $204 million USD initially, and in 2014 it announced the fund was oversubscribed at $400 million USD.[5] OPIC, the U.S. government’s development finance institution, committed to invest up to $200 million USD in December 2015, the largest investment commitment historically by OPIC to any impact fund manager.[17] In January 2016, Prudential Financial invested $350 million USD with the firm.[8]
LeapFrog has offices in Mauritius, Singapore, South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom.[8]

LeapFrog Investments is a private investment firm that invests in high-growth financial services and healthcare companies in emerging markets. The firm's investments have an annual growth rate of more than 40% and its companies reach approximately 93.4 million consumers,[4] primarily in Africa and Asia.[5]
LeapFrog has attracted over $1 billion from global investors since inception, including funds from investors such as Prudential Financial,[2] Swiss Re,[6] JP Morgan, TIAA-CREF[7] and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar's Omidyar Network.[8][9][10]
LeapFrog was founded in January 2007 by Andrew Kuper and officially launched in 2008 by former US President Bill Clinton who endorsed the firm for opening new frontiers for alternative investments.[11][12]
According to The Economist, LeapFrog is a well-established impact investing firm.[13] The firm has invested in companies such as BIMA, a fintech business that provides services including mobile insurance to 20 million low income customers in Asia, Africa and Latin America,[4][14] India's Mahindra Insurance Brokers, a leading Indian insurance broker and part of Mahindra Group, and Kenyan retail pharmacy chain Goodlife.[11]
LeapFrog owns significant stakes in companies in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia and India.[15] It raised its first fund of $135 million in 2009 to invest in insurance and related financial services companies.[16] In September 2013, LeapFrog Investments launched its second fund, raising $204 million USD initially, and in 2014 it announced the fund was oversubscribed at $400 million USD.[5] OPIC, the U.S. government’s development finance institution, committed to invest up to $200 million USD in December 2015, the largest investment commitment historically by OPIC to any impact fund manager.[17] In January 2016, Prudential Financial invested $350 million USD with the firm.[8]
LeapFrog has offices in Mauritius, Singapore, South Africa, Australia and the United Kingdom.[8]
