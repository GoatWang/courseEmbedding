Inflation is back

Posted on February 15, 2017  by  Brinker Capital 

Reply 


Ryan Dressel, Investment Analyst
For the better part of the past five years, inflation growth rates in developed economies have barely budged, hovering below 1.5%. Coming out of the global financial crisis, global gross domestic product (GDP) growth was stuck below its long term average of 3% from 2011 to 2015. This extended period of low growth kept inflationary factors at depressed levels. In particular, tightened credit markets and low confidence in the broad economy had the most adverse effects on inflation. These factors limited both businesses and consumers from spending more, driving prices higher. Furthermore, the end of a decade-long commodity cycle kept input costs at extremely low levels.
Source: The World Bank
Recently however, economic signs of life indicate that inflation is on the verge of returning to normal levels. The price of oil has rebounded off of its lowest point since 2008. The housing market is healthy. Purchases of consumer durable goods such as automobiles surged 11% over the past year. And, according to FactSet Research Systems, wages have begun to rise as the labor force has regained traction after massive displacements caused by the global financial crisis. These economic data points have led the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) to rise 2.1% in the 12 months through December 2016, the largest increase since June 2014. Additionally, inflation accelerated for the fifth consecutive month.
Source: FactSet Research Systems
Additional factors have also raised inflation expectations in 2017 and beyond. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has long-held a position of allowing inflation to run past its 2% target in order to reverse the negative effects of the great recession. Proposed policies of President Donald J. Trump are expected to further drive inflation rates higher. President Trump is expected to push for up to $1 trillion from Congress to upgrade infrastructure, introduce major tax cuts, de-regulate industry, and implement a number of protectionist trade policies in the coming year. These factors are all expected to drive inflation higher.
Outside the U.S., other signs are surfacing as well. The Eurozone recorded a 1.8% rise in consumer prices (YoY) in January, despite a turbulent Brexit vote and plummeting currencies. Factory prices in China are rising and wages in Japan have risen to their highest levels since 2010.
Why should investors care about inflation?

Rising inflation positively impacts borrowers of existing debt (if real interest rates are negative), producers that experience prices rising faster than costs, and workers with strong wage bargaining power.
Adversely, inflation negatively impacts workers with low wage bargaining power (including fixed incomes), lenders, businesses with high wage pressures, and investors whose returns cannot outpace inflation over the long term.

How can investors prepare?
Investors should remain invested in a diversified portfolio over a reasonably long period of time in order to protect and grow purchasing power to sustain their standard of living in the future. Brinker Capital is committed to helping investors create the purchasing power needed to pay for personal, financial or lifestyle goals.
For 30 years, Brinker Capital has provided investment solutions based on ideas generated from listening to the needs of advisors and investors. From being a pioneer of multi-asset class investments to using behavioral finance to manage the emotions of investing, our disciplined approach is the key to helping clients achieve better outcomes.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Addressing Diversity through Gateway to Leadership

Posted on December 21, 2015  by  Brinker Capital 

Reply 


John Coyne, Vice Chairman
“The investment advice profession has a long way to go in reflecting the diversity of America,” so says Elizabeth MacBride in her recent InvestmentNews feature, “A Diversity Problem”—and she’s not wrong. The financial services industry, as a whole, has too often trailed other professions in terms of diversity among the workforce; but, that’s not to say nothing is being done to address it.
At the Money Management Institute (MMI), the national association for the investment advisory solutions industry, we have cultivated a program that purposefully addresses this issue head-on.

The Gateway to Leadership program was established in 2007 and is designed to introduce qualified minority students to the investment advisory solutions business. Through the program, we place candidates from historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in paid summer internships with leading financial services firms and fellow MMI members.
Brinker Capital has been entrenched from the beginning of Gateway to Leadership as our founder Chuck Widger was one of the original architects of the program. I, too, am fortunate to serve as the chairman of this program and have been able to see many participating students come through the doors at Brinker Capital over the last nine years.
While the placement of 160 students across 31 HBCUs into 34 host firms is small in context to the larger issue, we are proud of the program’s growth, success and the enthusiasm to which it has been received by its participants.
The views expressed are those of Brinker Capital and are not intended as investment advice or recommendation. For informational purposes only. Holdings are subject to change. Brinker Capital, Inc., a Registered Investment Advisor.

Noreen Beaman, Chief Executive Officer, Brinker Capital

It is with great pleasure that I am able to announce that our Crystal Strategies Suite of absolute return portfolios has been awarded the Money Management Institute’s Advisory Solutions Product of the Year!
The Money Management Institute (MMI) is the national organization for the advisory solutions industry.  They represent portfolio manager firms and sponsors of investment consulting programs. MMI serves as the leading forum for the industry’s leaders to address common concerns, discuss industry issues, and ultimately, work together to better serve investors.
At Brinker Capital, our goal is to provide financial advisors with innovative products and solutions so that they can best serve their clients. With this award, I am proud to see that we are getting it right.

Brinker Capital Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Brinker Capital Announces the Launch of the Destinations Funds
Apr 10 17
Brinker Capital announced the launch of the Destinations Funds (the Funds), a series of 10 multi-manager mutual funds advised by Brinker Capital. The Funds now serve as the building blocks of the Destinations fee-based mutual fund advisory portfolios, which launched in 1995 and currently have $9.3 billion in assets under management (as of March 31, 2017). With the Funds being part of the Destinations advisory portfolios, Brinker Capital is able to provide a cost-effective solution to investors and a level fee structure that aligns with the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule. With this change, Brinker Capital reduced existing qualified investors' overall costs by an average of 21%, and lowered the account minimum of the Destinations portfolios to $10,000, making an institutional multi-asset class investment experience more widely available to individual investors. The 10 institutional class Funds which make up the Destinations multi-asset class portfolios are as follows: Destinations Large Cap Equity Fund, Destinations Small-Mid Cap Equity Fund, Destinations Equity Income Fund, Destinations International Equity Fund, Destinations Core Fixed Income Fund, Destinations Low Duration Fixed Income Fund, Destinations Global Fixed Income Opportunities Fund, Destinations Municipal Fixed Income Fund, Destinations Real Assets Fund, and Destinations Multi Strategy Alternatives Fund. The Funds are available on the Fidelity and Pershing institutional no transaction fee mutual fund platforms.


Brinker Capital, Inc. Announces Executive Appointments
Apr 5 17
Brinker Capital, Inc. announced the expansion of its investment team with three key appointments: Tim Holland, CFA as Senior Vice President, Global Investment Strategist and Vice Chair of the Asset Allocation Committee; Amy Magnotta, CFA as Senior Vice President, Head of Discretionary Portfolios and Chair of the Asset Allocation Committee; and Jeff Raupp, CFA as Director of Investments and Chair of the Investment Group Executive Committee. Holland will work closely with senior members of the investment team to develop Brinker Capital's top-down macroeconomic and capital market outlook. Additionally, he will develop Brinker Capital's messaging as it relates to the firm's investment views and the positioning of its portfolios. Holland brings more than 15 years of investment experience to Brinker Capital. Prior to joining the firm, Holland worked as a Portfolio Manager at TAMRO Capital Partners in Alexandria, Va., where he was responsible for directing overall portfolio construction based on fundamental company and industry analysis and understanding the potential impact of economic, industry, and political trends on portfolio holdings. Magnotta is responsible for all fully discretionary multi-asset class portfolios, and works with the Asset Allocation Committee members to develop policy on asset allocation structure and positioning. Raupp leads the investment team and has overall responsibility for investment policy. Holland, Hart, and Magnotta each report directly to Raupp.


Brinker Capital Partners with Adhesion to Deliver Multi-Asset Class Investment Solutions to RIAs on Adhesion’s Unified Managed Account Platform
Oct 20 16
Brinker Capital announced that it has partnered with Adhesion Wealth Advisor Solutions to make Destinations and Destinations ETFh products available to the RIAs on its platform. Through the partnership, all Adhesion’s RIA clients that custody at Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Pershing, and TD Ameritrade will have access to Brinker Capital’s multi-asset class investment products that seek to provide consistent, risk-adjusted returns and downside protection. Destinations is a mutual fund solution that features seven risk-based portfolios, available as qualified or taxable models. Expanding beyond Destinations’ exclusive use of mutual funds, Destinations ETFh introduces ETF’s to provide exposures in more efficient asset classes, more direct or concentrated exposures, and niche strategies not available in a mutual fund format. Destinations ETFh uses actively managed funds where viable ETF options are not available, for less efficient asset classes, and any other areas consistently successful active managers can provide a significant advantage.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.
