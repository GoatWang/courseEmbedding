It was perhaps only a matter of time before Avista Corp. agreed to sell to a neighbor from the north.Large Canadian power companies have been snapping up smaller American ones for several years, paying tens of billions of dollars to expand their geographic footprint in a country that offers lighter regulations and higher returns on investment.
Toronto-based Hydro One’s $5.3 billion pending purchase of Avista, announced Wednesday, follows major acquisitions by Canadian companies Enbridge Inc., TransCanada Corp., Fortis Inc., and Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.Each of those deals catapulted the buyer into the leading ranks of North American utilities. If the Avista purchase passes regulatory muster — a process that may take up to a year — Hydro One’s assets will total $25.4 billion.
With the industry consolidating, a Bloomberg report about a year ago placed Avista on a list of a dozen U.S. utilities that would be likely acquisition targets. In terms of size, Avista is ranked 46th of 50 publicly traded utilities in the U.S., said Scott Morris, the company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer.Like other Canadian buyers seeking stable investments, Hydro One was willing to pay a premium for Avista.

RRSP Investors: Significant Upside Remains With Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.

Chris MacDonald | July 17, 2017 | More on:  AQN AQN








 




Over the past month, shares of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. (TSX:AQN)(NYSE:AQN) have declined substantially. Investors are now attempting to understand which direction shares of the Canadian utilities company will move in the near term.

While the most recent decline, a drop of approximately 6% from the company’s peak, represents a buying opportunity for some, many long-term investors looking for the best possible entry point in Algonquin have understandably waited on the sidelines to see if the sell-off has ended or if the slide has just begun.

Here’s why I believe the most recent sell-off represents an excellent buying opportunity for RRSP investors to…

Over the past month, shares of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.  (TSX:AQN)(NYSE:AQN) have declined substantially. Investors are now attempting to understand which direction shares of the Canadian utilities company will move in the near term.
While the most recent decline, a drop of approximately 6% from the company’s peak, represents a buying opportunity for some, many long-term investors looking for the best possible entry point in Algonquin have understandably waited on the sidelines to see if the sell-off has ended or if the slide has just begun.
Here’s why I believe the most recent sell-off represents an excellent buying opportunity for RRSP investors to load up on shares of a utilities company which should expect continued outperformance in the long run, despite the most recent move by the Bank of Canada to hike interest rates.
Last week, Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz followed through with a highly anticipated interest rate hike — the first hike in seven years, following two rate cuts in the past two years resulting from lower commodity prices, which negatively impacted the Canadian economy.
The Bank of Canada determined that an interest rate hike would be in the best interest of Canadians, suggesting that while the Canadian economy has not yet shown full employment or hit its inflation target, leaving rates too low for too long may have negatively impacted the Bank’s monetary policy ability moving forward and resulted in certain sectors of the economy overheating.
Rising interest rates are typically considered a very bad thing for certain industries, such as utilities or REITs, due to the fact that these high-yielding securities tend to move downward alongside bonds in period of rising rates.
With that in mind, investors will need to consider how likely additional rate increases are moving forward, as further increases would certainly negatively impact companies like Algonquin moving forward.
One more rate hike would get the Bank of Canada back to the 1% key lending rate — something which many analysts think is likely; however, the timeline of such a hike remains very uncertain.
Poloz has made comments in recent days following the most recent rate hike that the Bank of Canada must remain cautious to certain developments over the coming quarters in weighing additional rate hikes.
New developments with NAFTA negotiations as well as how commodity prices fare over the medium term will be key deciding factors in how the Bank of Canada decides to move.
Bottom line
Algonquin has performed well in a low interest rate environment, and I expect that interest rates will stay within the 0.75-1% range for the foreseeable future. Investors with a medium- to long-term view will be well served by loading up on Algonquin — one of the premier defensive securities available on the TSX today.
Stay Foolish, my friends.

Breakthrough IPO Receives Rare Endorsement

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Completes Acquisition of The Empire District Electric Company

OAKVILLE,ON, Jan. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. ("APUC") (TSX: AQN, NYSE:    AQN) announced today that a subsidiary of Liberty Utilities Co. ("Liberty Utilities"), APUC's wholly-owned regulated utility business, successfully completed its acquisition of The Empire District Electric Company ("Empire") for an aggregate purchase price of approximately Cdn$3.2 billion (the "Transaction"). Empire is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Utilities and will cease to be a publicly-held corporation.








With the closing of the Transaction, APUC has materially expanded its utility operations in the United States. APUC, through its 2,200 employees, now serves over 782,000 electric, gas, and water customers within its regulated utility business, and APUC's portfolio of power generating facilities now contains both regulated and non-regulated power facilities with a total capacity of over 2,500 MW.
"Empire is highly complementary to the scope of our current operations, brings valuable scale to our existing utility business, and adds further support to our annual dividend growth target of 10% through significant accretion to per share cash flows and earnings," said Ian Robertson, Chief Executive Officer of APUC. "The APUC and Empire teams have worked diligently to successfully bring our companies together, and we are excited about the many opportunities that our newly expanded platform brings to our growth prospects in North America." 
As previously announced, Empire's shareholders will receive US$34.00 per common share which, including the assumption of approximately US$0.8 billion of debt at closing, represents an aggregate purchase price of approximately US$2.3 billion (Cdn$3.2 billion). 
As a result of the closing, Empire's common stock is being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Empire shareholders will be provided with instructions on how to receive the merger consideration for their shares by Wells Fargo, in its capacity as paying agent for the transaction.
APUC will issue shortly a final instalment notice (the "Final Instalment Notice") notifying holders of its 5% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures ("Debentures") represented by instalment receipts of the date for payment of the final instalment (the "Final Instalment Date"), which shall not be less than 15 days nor more than 90 days following the date of such notice in accordance with the terms of the instalment receipts. Additional details will be set out in the Final Instalment Notice regarding, among other things, the right of holders of Debentures who have paid the final instalment to receive a make-whole payment and to convert their Debentures into APUC common shares.
About Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp.

Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements included in this news release contain information that is forward-looking within the meaning of certain securities laws, including information and statements regarding expected benefits from the Transaction and the issuance of the final instalment notice. These statements are based on factors or assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including assumptions based on historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments. Since forward-looking statements relate to future events and conditions, by their very nature they require making assumptions and involve inherent risks and uncertainties. APUC cautions that although it is believed that the assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances, these risks and uncertainties give rise to the possibility that actual results may differ materially from the expectations set out in the forward-looking statements. Material risk factors include those set out in the management's discussion and analysis section of APUC's most recent annual report, quarterly report, and APUC's Annual Information Form. Given these risks, undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of their dates. Other than as specifically required by law, APUC undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

Public listing[edit]
Algonquin Power Income Fund was established in September 1997 and first listed its trust units on the Toronto Stock Exchange on December 23, 1997.[1] Having raised nearly $75m, Algonquin used $27.5m to purchase 14 hydroelectric generation facilities located in Ontario, Québec, New York and New Hampshire.
Incorporation[edit]
In response to the Government of Canada's decision to end the preferential tax treatment of income trusts, Algonquin Power Income Fund was converted to a corporation in October 2009.[2] Unit-holders exchanged their trust units on a one-for-one basis for shares in the new corporate entity, Algonquin Power & Utilities.
