Cerner Care FAQs






                            What is Cerner Care?
                        




                                As the number of ways to manage health continues to grow, Cerner is taking the first of several steps to create a structure that will simplify how you interact with our web-based applications. Cerner Care is a single sign on platform for most Cerner online applications and support websites for healthcare providers, healthcare IT professionals and partners. After setting up a Cerner Care account, you’ll be able to sign in once to access multiple web-based applications. You can log in using a single email address instead of having to manage multiple usernames and passwords for multiple applications.
                            







                            Where do I create a Cerner Care account?
                        




                                You can go to a number of different websites to begin your Cerner Care account creation such as the examples below.  When creating your Cerner Care account, it is highly recommended to only use your organization’s email domain for creation.

                            I am having trouble logging into my Cerner Care account. What should I do?
                        




                                There is a Forgot Password option on the log in screen.  If you go through that process and are unable to successfully answer both of your security questions, you need to call Cerner Client Care at 1-866-221-8877, Option 6.  The team is available Monday-Friday from 7am-7pm CST to assist.

                            I still see a message on the left prompting me to create my new Cerner Care account. Do I need to create a new Cerner Care account each time I log in?
                        




                                No. Once you’ve created a Cerner Care account, simply use your email address and password to log in. You’ll continue to see the account creation reminder for a brief period of time, but you don’t need to create a new account each time.

Benefits of our Electronic Health Record (EHR)






                            About our EHR
                        




                                Cerner’s EHR supports an enterprise-wide view of clinical information to coordinate patient care and document the point at which it was delivered in both acute inpatient and outpatient settings. It helps providers have access to the right information at the right time and within the clinical workflows to make the best possible decisions. Our powerful decision support uses predictive algorithms to fire rules and alerts that inform physicians about patient safety.
                            







                            Our clinical documentation tools

                            The power of integration
                        




                                With new value-based payment models and to ensure success in today’s health care environment, your revenue cycle solutions must tightly integrate into the clinical process.

Methodist Health System
IT analysts throughout Methodist Health System say their recent seamless software conversion was a direct result of using Cerner’s Upgrade Center.

The 471-bed hospital system completed its latest conversion in June 2015, and by utilizing Upgrade Center resources, the Omaha-based organization successfully made the transition faster and with fewer errors.

“Before switching to the Upgrade Center, the IT analysts were responsible for testing pretty much everything,” said Systems Analyst Paula Grupe. “It was difficult because we didn’t know all of the workflows.”

Methodist Health System’s 137-person IT staff was forced to put their day-to-day projects on a two-month hold and spend most of their time testing.

“We were learning and trying to figure out the appropriate phases and trying to escalate those issues ourselves,” said Director of Systems Development Susan Clauser.

Using the Upgrade Center allowed Methodist Health System to shift a large portion of the solution testing and coding to Cerner associates.  These trained analysts brought solution-specific knowledge to the table and made for a higher quality conversion.

At the CHIME Fall 2016 CIO Forum this week; two national health care organizations are honoring University of Missouri Health Care in Columbia, Mo., for its exceptional work in health care informatics.
Tom Selva, MD, MU Health Care's chief medical information officer, and Bryan Bliven, chief information officer, accepted the Transformational Leadership Award on Wednesday, Nov. 2 in Phoenix.
"In our system, we don't do information technology projects," Dr. Selva said. "We do projects for our patients and our clinicians that are enabled by IT. That's an important distinction, and one that ensures we're meeting the needs of our consumers."
The College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and the American Hospital Association (AHA) sponsor the award, which honors organizations for developing and deploying transformational information technology that improves and streamlines care.

A Small Raft in Big Water Guide: Using Top-Down Leadership and Model Experience to Optimize in a Quarter of the Time

Vail Valley Medical Center has been a Cerner client for more than a decade.  And during that time, it heavily customized its Cerner solutions.  All that customization made installing and launching some projects double the standard Cerner timeline.

So when leaders at the Colorado-based regional healthcare facility wanted to implement a new physician documentation solution, they learned it could be a year-long project. Then, they discovered the Model Experience. 

"Cerner told us, with our level of customization, it would take about 12 months," said Ryan Thousand. "We did it in three."

And, the Manager of Clinical Applications added, "it was twice as easy as expected."

Thousand, an outdoor enthusiast noted, "we faced this river – and we had to navigate it fast."

North York General Hospital
At Toronto-based North York General Hospital (NYGH), one simple phrase resonates across the organization's 5,000+ staff, physicians and volunteers: Our patients come first in everything we do. With that mentality, the three-facility academic medical center embarked on a multi-year clinical transformation, including a complete redesign of its medication administration process.
In 2010, NYGH implemented a closed-loop medication administration (CLMA) process, which allows clinicians to use Cerner's fully integrated electronic health record (EHR) to ensure the right dose of the right medication is given to the right patient at the right time. By leveraging information technology solutions, like Cerner's PowerChart, WorkFlowMonitor, PharmNet and CareMobile, at every step in the process, CLMA eliminates manual entry and fires an alert if a medication does not match the active orders in the EHR. From 2010-2015, NYGH detected and avoided more than 11,000 potential medication errors using CLMA.
"The Canadian Adverse Events study identified that 23.6 percent of adverse events in hospitals are related to medications, and that many of these events are preventable." said Chief Medical Information Officer, Dr. Jeremy Theal. "CLMA is a prime example of how health information technology can reduce the risk of medication errors and make it easier for clinicians to deliver high quality care."

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

					Event Description
					



					
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									We have a cerner emr system that is connected to a philips patient monitoring system to chart vital signs (vs) semi-automatically.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									The system requires the nurse to request the vs be downloaded, verify the vs and have them post to the patients chart.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Several times the staff reports that vital signs have been downloaded, viewed, approved and have subsequently disappeared from the system.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									Cerner apparently was aware of the problem and installed a "patch" to fix it.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									The frequency of the problem had significantly decreased but the problem continues to present.
									
							
						
							
								
								
									
										
									
									This is a complex problem and troubleshooting requires collaboration between in-house biomed, the hospital's corporate  it emr team, and the cerner troubleshooting team.

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

A Letter to Our Shareholders, Clients and Associates in 2017
I like to say that the intersection of health care and information technology (IT) is a great place to wake up every morning. Our environment has always been influenced by the trends, changes and pressures of both environments. Considered separately, they are two of the largest, fastest moving, most complex currents in the economy. The interplay between them creates unique challenges and opportunities. 2016 saw health care trying to assert itself—temporarily at least—as the stronger stream.

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

A Letter to Our Shareholders, Clients and Associates in 2017
I like to say that the intersection of health care and information technology (IT) is a great place to wake up every morning. Our environment has always been influenced by the trends, changes and pressures of both environments. Considered separately, they are two of the largest, fastest moving, most complex currents in the economy. The interplay between them creates unique challenges and opportunities. 2016 saw health care trying to assert itself—temporarily at least—as the stronger stream.

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

History[edit]
Cerner was founded in 1979 by Neal Patterson, Paul Gorup, and Cliff Illig, who were colleagues at Arthur Andersen. Its original name was PGI & Associates but was renamed Cerner in 1984 when it rolled out its first system, PathNet.[6] It went public in 1986.[7] Cerner's client base grew steadily in the late 1980s, reaching 70 sites in 1987, 120 sites in 1988, 170 sites in 1989, and reaching 250 sites in 1990. Installations were primarily of PathNet systems.[8]
During this time, Cerner was developing components of a Health Network Architecture (HNA), an integrated IT system designed to automate health care processes. Clients could purchase individual components or the whole system at one time. By 1994, more than 30 clients had purchased the full HNA system, while 100 clients had purchased multiple components of the system.[8]
In 1997, the company introduced Cerner Millennium, an upgrade to its HNA system which incorporated all of the company’s software offerings into one unified architecture. The introduction of Millennium contributed to significant growth for the company, with revenue increasing to $1.1 billion in 2005[9] from $245.1 million in 1997.[10]
Cerner acquired IMC Health Care, Inc. in early 2010 to continue expanding its wellness services to outside commercial employers, pharmacies and wellness programs.[11]
In July 2010, president Trace Devanny left the company[12] and Patterson became the company’s president, in addition to his roles as chairman and chief executive officer.[13] In September 2013, Zane Burke was named president, assuming the title from Patterson.[14]
On August 5, 2014, Cerner announced its intent to purchase Siemens Health Services, the health information technology business of Germany’s Siemens AG, for $1.3 billion.[15] The acquisition was completed on February 2, 2015.[16]
On July 29, 2015, Leidos Partnership for Defense Health, which includes Cerner, Accenture, and Leidos, was awarded a 10-year, $4.3 billion contract to overhaul and manage the electronic health records for the Department of Defense.[17]
CEO and co-founder Neal Patterson died July 9, 2017.[2]
Controversy[edit]
In 2001, a memo authored by CEO Patterson and sent to about 400 managers was leaked online. The memo, written in harsh language, was meant to motivate the managers to get more productivity out of employees and promised layoffs, a hiring freeze, closing of an "Associate Center", and the implementation of a punch-card system if Patterson did not see evidence of changes. Patterson's metric was the fullness of the company's Kansas City office lot at the hours of 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. The memo was widely seen as inflammatory and poor management, and Cerner's stock price fell 22% over three days.[18]
In 2002, the installation of a computerized health system by Cerner in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a "disaster", according to Phillip Longman, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation. Longman wrote, "According to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal Pediatrics, mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled, from 2.8 percent before the installation to almost 6.6 percent afterward."[19] Defenders of Cerner in the study charged that the Pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the CPOE system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process, did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth, and did not have order sets pre-programmed on day one. They noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems.[20]
In 2005, Cerner and other companies paid for a report by the RAND Corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records, including savings of $81 billion a year or more, which RAND now says is overstated. This report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors. Cerner's revenue tripled from $1 billion in 2005 to a projected $3 billion in 2013. The study was criticized by the Congressional Budget Office for overstating potential savings. A 2013 reassessment of the 2005 report by the RAND Corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient care.[21]
In 2010 Girard Medical Center, Crawford County, Kansas, hired Cerner to install an electronic records system. But after receiving $1.3 million, Cerner employees failed to get the system running in time to qualify for federal incentive payments, and in September 2011 notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project, according to a lawsuit Girard filed against Cerner. Cerner and executives at Girard agreed that Girard did not have adequate staff to manage the acquisition and implementation of the system.[22] As of June 2014 the case was still in arbitration.[21][23]
In 2012 Trinity Health, a small hospital in North Dakota, sued Cerner, claiming that Cerner's patient accounting solution didn't work correctly; the parties settled for $106M in 2014.[24]
In 2014, Cerner was embroiled in litigation with the Girard case still unsettled, a grand jury in California having found that Cerner knew that Ventura County healthcare executives were unprepared to work with Cerner in a $32 million installation, and with a $31 million Cerner implementation at the Athens Regional Health System in Georgia having turned into a disaster, leading to the forced departures of the CEO and the CIO of the health system.[23]
In 2016 the Nanaimo hospital ER began using the system. Physicians have called it a "huge failure" with it increasing some types of errors and slowing down the emergency department.[25]
Locations[edit]
Cerner's world headquarters campus is at 2800 Rockcreek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri.[26] It acquired additional space in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005[27] and in 2006 it acquired another location in Kansas City.[28] In 2013, Cerner announced plans to redevelop 236-acres in south Kansas City, Missouri into an office park. The site was previously occupied by Bannister Mall, which was demolished in 2009.[29] Cerner broke ground on the new campus on November 11, 2014. The $4.45 billion project intends to employ 16,000 new Cerner workers within the decade.[30]
Cerner has offices in about 25 countries worldwide.[31]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
