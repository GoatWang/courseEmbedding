Warranty
 
Clean Solar believes that long term relationships are the cornerstone of our business and we work hard to exceed our customer’s expectations. We go to great lengths to prevent problems from occurring with your solar power system.

The Longest Full Solar Warranty in the Industry

Clean Solar guarantees all workmanship and installation for 15 years – 5 years more than most other companies in the industry.
The 15 year full warranty includes parts and labor associated with replacing or repairing your system as well as all penetrations that we make to your roof. The 15 year term begins on the date of installation listed on the signed contract.
This 15 year warranty includes the entire portion of your roof that we cover with solar panels. Clean Solar installs extra flashings and the recommended urethane caulking to guarantee a clean and leak free installation.  Our competitors offer a limited one year warranty on your roof.
Leased solar systems are for the term of the lease agreement.

Solar Panel 25 Year Warranty
Clean Solar only uses the highest quality solar panels from the world’s leading solar panel manufacturers. Most of our photovoltaic panel manufacturers offer warranties of a very similar nature, guaranteeing energy production from their panels for 25 years . This is standard in the solar industry. If your solar panels malfunction or degrade past the normal variance, Clean Solar will replace the panel(s) for you.

	        	        Canadian Solars PV panel modules have very strong attractiveness in terms of their cheap price. This allows us to sell products to small enterprises.

	        						XSOL Co., Ltd.
	        					




	        	        We use these panels in our installations because they are really good products. Their efficiency is one of the best in the market and they have lower temperature coefficient than average, which is important in the hot conditions of Australia.

Company history[edit]
Founded in 2001 in Canada by Dr. Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) operates as a global energy provider with business subsidiaries in over 24 countries on 6 continents.[1] Besides serving as a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provider of solar energy solutions, Canadian Solar has a geographically diversified pipeline of utility-scale power projects. With the company’s recent acquisition of Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar’s total project pipeline is now 20.4 GW, including an increase in the late-stage project pipeline to 2.4 GW. Including two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canadian Solar employs nearly 9,000 workers worldwide. This translates to more than 16 GW of panel shipments, or approximately 70 million PV modules, in the past 15 years.[2] Together with Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar is ushering the way into a new era of clean, competitive, mainstream power.
Manufacturing[edit]
Canadian Solar production facilities in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil are structured for the manufacturing of ingots, wafers, solar cells, solar PV modules, solar power systems and specialized solar products.
In 2008, Canadian Solar was one of the first module manufacturers to have an onsite ISO/IEC 17025-compliant testing laboratory. The Canadian Solar Photovoltaic Testing Lab was established to ensure compliance with international safety and reliability testing standards for solar panels.[3]
The bulk of Canadian Solar's manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and China.[4] The Ontario plant has a production capacity of over 500 MW per year.[5] Canadian Solar passed the OHSAS 18001 international standards for occupational health and safety after auditing by TÜV Rheinland in 2012.[6]

Canadian Solar products adhere to international quality standards, including IEC 61215, IEC 61730, UL 1703, KEMCO, CE, JET CQC and MCS.[27]
Canadian Solar modules have achieved the maximum ratings in tests for ammonia (NH3) resistance of solar modules and have also passed IEC 61701 salt mist resistance testing[28] and are highly PID resistant.[citation needed]
Canadian Solar modules rank highly under PVUSA test conditions (PTC).[29]
Canadian Solar modules passed blowing sand test according to IEC 60068-2-68 to determine the effects of dust and sand on electrotechnical products.
Warranty and insurance[edit]
Canadian Solar was one of the first companies[30] in the industry to offer enhanced product and performance warranty backed by an immediately available and non-cancellable insurance policy.
In 2011, Canadian Solar introduced a linear performance guarantee for PV module power output over a 25-year period. Under this policy, Canadian Solar expanded its product warranty covering workmanship and material defects up to 10 years.[31]

Company history[edit]
Founded in 2001 in Canada by Dr. Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) operates as a global energy provider with business subsidiaries in over 24 countries on 6 continents.[1] Besides serving as a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provider of solar energy solutions, Canadian Solar has a geographically diversified pipeline of utility-scale power projects. With the company’s recent acquisition of Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar’s total project pipeline is now 20.4 GW, including an increase in the late-stage project pipeline to 2.4 GW. Including two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canadian Solar employs nearly 9,000 workers worldwide. This translates to more than 16 GW of panel shipments, or approximately 70 million PV modules, in the past 15 years.[2] Together with Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar is ushering the way into a new era of clean, competitive, mainstream power.
Manufacturing[edit]
Canadian Solar production facilities in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil are structured for the manufacturing of ingots, wafers, solar cells, solar PV modules, solar power systems and specialized solar products.
In 2008, Canadian Solar was one of the first module manufacturers to have an onsite ISO/IEC 17025-compliant testing laboratory. The Canadian Solar Photovoltaic Testing Lab was established to ensure compliance with international safety and reliability testing standards for solar panels.[3]
The bulk of Canadian Solar's manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and China.[4] The Ontario plant has a production capacity of over 500 MW per year.[5] Canadian Solar passed the OHSAS 18001 international standards for occupational health and safety after auditing by TÜV Rheinland in 2012.[6]

Products & projects[edit]
Canadian Solar offers solar modules, solar power systems, off-grid solar home application systems and specialized solar products.
Canadian Solar's global PV project business unit has been in operation for over six years and develops PV projects worldwide, specializing in project development, system design, engineering and financing. In addition, Canadian Solar can handle the deployment of photovoltaic projects systems, ranging from commercial systems of a few hundred kilowatts to utility-scale projects measured in mega-watts.
Acquisitions[edit]
Recurrent Energy: Canadian Solar (Nasdaq: CSIQ) completed the acquisition of solar developer Recurrent Energy from Sharp Corp for approximately $265 million in 2015.[26]
Technology[edit]
Canadian Solar's standard modules are powered by 156 x 156 mm (6 inch) high efficiency mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline solar cells. Their new Dymond double-glass modules have better reliability and are PID-free; their five bus bar cells deliver higher module wattages and higher reliability.
Performance and reliability[edit]
Canadian Solar products adhere to international quality standards, including IEC 61215, IEC 61730, UL 1703, KEMCO, CE, JET CQC and MCS.[27]
Canadian Solar modules have achieved the maximum ratings in tests for ammonia (NH3) resistance of solar modules and have also passed IEC 61701 salt mist resistance testing[28] and are highly PID resistant.[citation needed]
Canadian Solar modules rank highly under PVUSA test conditions (PTC).[29]
Canadian Solar modules passed blowing sand test according to IEC 60068-2-68 to determine the effects of dust and sand on electrotechnical products.
Warranty and insurance[edit]
Canadian Solar was one of the first companies[30] in the industry to offer enhanced product and performance warranty backed by an immediately available and non-cancellable insurance policy.
In 2011, Canadian Solar introduced a linear performance guarantee for PV module power output over a 25-year period. Under this policy, Canadian Solar expanded its product warranty covering workmanship and material defects up to 10 years.[31]

Company history[edit]
Founded in 2001 in Canada by Dr. Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) operates as a global energy provider with business subsidiaries in over 24 countries on 6 continents.[1] Besides serving as a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provider of solar energy solutions, Canadian Solar has a geographically diversified pipeline of utility-scale power projects. With the company’s recent acquisition of Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar’s total project pipeline is now 20.4 GW, including an increase in the late-stage project pipeline to 2.4 GW. Including two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canadian Solar employs nearly 9,000 workers worldwide. This translates to more than 16 GW of panel shipments, or approximately 70 million PV modules, in the past 15 years.[2] Together with Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar is ushering the way into a new era of clean, competitive, mainstream power.

Products & projects[edit]
Canadian Solar offers solar modules, solar power systems, off-grid solar home application systems and specialized solar products.
Canadian Solar's global PV project business unit has been in operation for over six years and develops PV projects worldwide, specializing in project development, system design, engineering and financing. In addition, Canadian Solar can handle the deployment of photovoltaic projects systems, ranging from commercial systems of a few hundred kilowatts to utility-scale projects measured in mega-watts.
Acquisitions[edit]
Recurrent Energy: Canadian Solar (Nasdaq: CSIQ) completed the acquisition of solar developer Recurrent Energy from Sharp Corp for approximately $265 million in 2015.[26]
Technology[edit]
Canadian Solar's standard modules are powered by 156 x 156 mm (6 inch) high efficiency mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline solar cells. Their new Dymond double-glass modules have better reliability and are PID-free; their five bus bar cells deliver higher module wattages and higher reliability.
Performance and reliability[edit]
Canadian Solar products adhere to international quality standards, including IEC 61215, IEC 61730, UL 1703, KEMCO, CE, JET CQC and MCS.[27]
Canadian Solar modules have achieved the maximum ratings in tests for ammonia (NH3) resistance of solar modules and have also passed IEC 61701 salt mist resistance testing[28] and are highly PID resistant.[citation needed]
Canadian Solar modules rank highly under PVUSA test conditions (PTC).[29]
Canadian Solar modules passed blowing sand test according to IEC 60068-2-68 to determine the effects of dust and sand on electrotechnical products.
Warranty and insurance[edit]
Canadian Solar was one of the first companies[30] in the industry to offer enhanced product and performance warranty backed by an immediately available and non-cancellable insurance policy.
In 2011, Canadian Solar introduced a linear performance guarantee for PV module power output over a 25-year period. Under this policy, Canadian Solar expanded its product warranty covering workmanship and material defects up to 10 years.[31]

S&P 500, Nasdaq extend the July rally, retest of record highs within view
U.S. stocks are mixed early Thursday, treading water as Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen concludes two days of scheduled remarks before Congress, and as second-quarter earnings season kicks in. Against this backdrop, each major U.S. benchmark has registered a month-to-date peak, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has notched a record close, though by a narrow three-point margin.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Warranty
 
Clean Solar believes that long term relationships are the cornerstone of our business and we work hard to exceed our customer’s expectations. We go to great lengths to prevent problems from occurring with your solar power system.

The Longest Full Solar Warranty in the Industry

Clean Solar guarantees all workmanship and installation for 15 years – 5 years more than most other companies in the industry.
The 15 year full warranty includes parts and labor associated with replacing or repairing your system as well as all penetrations that we make to your roof. The 15 year term begins on the date of installation listed on the signed contract.
This 15 year warranty includes the entire portion of your roof that we cover with solar panels. Clean Solar installs extra flashings and the recommended urethane caulking to guarantee a clean and leak free installation.  Our competitors offer a limited one year warranty on your roof.
Leased solar systems are for the term of the lease agreement.

Solar Panel 25 Year Warranty
Clean Solar only uses the highest quality solar panels from the world’s leading solar panel manufacturers. Most of our photovoltaic panel manufacturers offer warranties of a very similar nature, guaranteeing energy production from their panels for 25 years . This is standard in the solar industry. If your solar panels malfunction or degrade past the normal variance, Clean Solar will replace the panel(s) for you.

Company history[edit]
Founded in 2001 in Canada by Dr. Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) operates as a global energy provider with business subsidiaries in over 24 countries on 6 continents.[1] Besides serving as a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provider of solar energy solutions, Canadian Solar has a geographically diversified pipeline of utility-scale power projects. With the company’s recent acquisition of Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar’s total project pipeline is now 20.4 GW, including an increase in the late-stage project pipeline to 2.4 GW. Including two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canadian Solar employs nearly 9,000 workers worldwide. This translates to more than 16 GW of panel shipments, or approximately 70 million PV modules, in the past 15 years.[2] Together with Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar is ushering the way into a new era of clean, competitive, mainstream power.
Manufacturing[edit]
Canadian Solar production facilities in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil are structured for the manufacturing of ingots, wafers, solar cells, solar PV modules, solar power systems and specialized solar products.
In 2008, Canadian Solar was one of the first module manufacturers to have an onsite ISO/IEC 17025-compliant testing laboratory. The Canadian Solar Photovoltaic Testing Lab was established to ensure compliance with international safety and reliability testing standards for solar panels.[3]
The bulk of Canadian Solar's manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and China.[4] The Ontario plant has a production capacity of over 500 MW per year.[5] Canadian Solar passed the OHSAS 18001 international standards for occupational health and safety after auditing by TÜV Rheinland in 2012.[6]
Environmental and quality management certifications[edit]

Technology[edit]
Canadian Solar's standard modules are powered by 156 x 156 mm (6 inch) high efficiency mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline solar cells. Their new Dymond double-glass modules have better reliability and are PID-free; their five bus bar cells deliver higher module wattages and higher reliability.
Performance and reliability[edit]
Canadian Solar products adhere to international quality standards, including IEC 61215, IEC 61730, UL 1703, KEMCO, CE, JET CQC and MCS.[27]
Canadian Solar modules have achieved the maximum ratings in tests for ammonia (NH3) resistance of solar modules and have also passed IEC 61701 salt mist resistance testing[28] and are highly PID resistant.[citation needed]
Canadian Solar modules rank highly under PVUSA test conditions (PTC).[29]
Canadian Solar modules passed blowing sand test according to IEC 60068-2-68 to determine the effects of dust and sand on electrotechnical products.
Warranty and insurance[edit]
Canadian Solar was one of the first companies[30] in the industry to offer enhanced product and performance warranty backed by an immediately available and non-cancellable insurance policy.
In 2011, Canadian Solar introduced a linear performance guarantee for PV module power output over a 25-year period. Under this policy, Canadian Solar expanded its product warranty covering workmanship and material defects up to 10 years.[31]

Products & projects[edit]
Canadian Solar offers solar modules, solar power systems, off-grid solar home application systems and specialized solar products.
Canadian Solar's global PV project business unit has been in operation for over six years and develops PV projects worldwide, specializing in project development, system design, engineering and financing. In addition, Canadian Solar can handle the deployment of photovoltaic projects systems, ranging from commercial systems of a few hundred kilowatts to utility-scale projects measured in mega-watts.
Acquisitions[edit]
Recurrent Energy: Canadian Solar (Nasdaq: CSIQ) completed the acquisition of solar developer Recurrent Energy from Sharp Corp for approximately $265 million in 2015.[26]
Technology[edit]
Canadian Solar's standard modules are powered by 156 x 156 mm (6 inch) high efficiency mono-crystalline or poly-crystalline solar cells. Their new Dymond double-glass modules have better reliability and are PID-free; their five bus bar cells deliver higher module wattages and higher reliability.
Performance and reliability[edit]
Canadian Solar products adhere to international quality standards, including IEC 61215, IEC 61730, UL 1703, KEMCO, CE, JET CQC and MCS.[27]
Canadian Solar modules have achieved the maximum ratings in tests for ammonia (NH3) resistance of solar modules and have also passed IEC 61701 salt mist resistance testing[28] and are highly PID resistant.[citation needed]
Canadian Solar modules rank highly under PVUSA test conditions (PTC).[29]
Canadian Solar modules passed blowing sand test according to IEC 60068-2-68 to determine the effects of dust and sand on electrotechnical products.
Warranty and insurance[edit]
Canadian Solar was one of the first companies[30] in the industry to offer enhanced product and performance warranty backed by an immediately available and non-cancellable insurance policy.
In 2011, Canadian Solar introduced a linear performance guarantee for PV module power output over a 25-year period. Under this policy, Canadian Solar expanded its product warranty covering workmanship and material defects up to 10 years.[31]

Company history[edit]
Founded in 2001 in Canada by Dr. Shawn Qu, Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) operates as a global energy provider with business subsidiaries in over 24 countries on 6 continents.[1] Besides serving as a manufacturer of solar PV modules and provider of solar energy solutions, Canadian Solar has a geographically diversified pipeline of utility-scale power projects. With the company’s recent acquisition of Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar’s total project pipeline is now 20.4 GW, including an increase in the late-stage project pipeline to 2.4 GW. Including two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities in Ontario, Canadian Solar employs nearly 9,000 workers worldwide. This translates to more than 16 GW of panel shipments, or approximately 70 million PV modules, in the past 15 years.[2] Together with Recurrent Energy, Canadian Solar is ushering the way into a new era of clean, competitive, mainstream power.
Manufacturing[edit]
Canadian Solar production facilities in Canada, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil are structured for the manufacturing of ingots, wafers, solar cells, solar PV modules, solar power systems and specialized solar products.
In 2008, Canadian Solar was one of the first module manufacturers to have an onsite ISO/IEC 17025-compliant testing laboratory. The Canadian Solar Photovoltaic Testing Lab was established to ensure compliance with international safety and reliability testing standards for solar panels.[3]
The bulk of Canadian Solar's manufacturing facilities are located in Canada and China.[4] The Ontario plant has a production capacity of over 500 MW per year.[5] Canadian Solar passed the OHSAS 18001 international standards for occupational health and safety after auditing by TÜV Rheinland in 2012.[6]
