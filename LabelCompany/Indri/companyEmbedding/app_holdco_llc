About Holdco, LLC

   Time Warner Cable (TWC) helped put cable on the map as one of the early US providers. The company is part of Charter Communications, the #2 US cable company after Comcast. TWC has operations in more than two dozen states across the country. It serves more than 16 million mostly residential customers (about 700,000 business customers) with video, high-speed data (primarily through ISP brand Road Runner), and voice offerings, as well as security and home management. In addition to video, voice, and data, other business services include networking and transport, outsourced IT, and cloud computing. TWC was acquired by Charter in mid-2016 and will be rebranded Spectrum.
  
Change in Company Type

   The acquisition of TWC as well as Bright House Networks makes Charter Communications one of the largest cable companiesin the US. Cable companies have faced threats from streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.com. The streaming services reach many subscribers over the networks of the cable providers. TWC brings not only a sizable number of business and residential subscribers to the new company, but access to content as well.
  
Operations

   TWC also operates local news broadcasting stations in New York (including New York City), North Carolina, and Texas, regional sports networks, as well as a news, sports, and entertainment online portal.
  

   The company generates about 80% of revenue from its residential services; business services and advertising account for about 15% and 5%, respectively.
  
Geographic Reach

   Its core service areas are in New York, the Midwest, Texas, the Carolinas, and southern California, but it has operations in nearly 30 states.
  
Sales and Marketing

   TWC markets its products and services via a host of direct channels (online, telemarketing, e-mail marketing, door-to-door sales), as well as through third-party partners and retailers. In 2015 TWC served approximately 10.8 million residential video subscribers, 12.7 million residential high-speed data subscribers, 6.3 million residential voice subscribers and 1.2 million Intelligent Home customers. The company has ramped up its advertising budget, spending about $720 million on advertising n 2015, compared to $684 million in 2014 and $676 million in 2013.
  
Financial Performance

   The company has seen strong revenue growth over the last decade. Sales in 2015 rose 4% to $23.7 billion on higher business service revenue from growth in high-speed data, voice subscribers and higher wholesale transport revenue. Residential services revenue rose on an increase in high-speed data subscribers and higher average revenue per subscriber.
  

   Despite the growth in revenue, TWC's's net income dropped 9% to $1.8 billion due to higher programming and content and sales and marketing expenses.
  

   In 2015 cash flow from operations rose about $190 million from 2014 to $6.5 billion.
  
Strategy

   Growth in TWC's residential operations has slowed in recent years as it operates in mature, competitive markets. The company seeks to extend its services to mobile devices and to non-TV devices to help it retain and gain customers. In a deal with Microsoft, TWC will make its TV app available for the Xbox One video game and entertainment system. Consumers with an Xbox Live account will have access to free and subscription On Demand titles. TWC teamed up with Boingo to provide Passpoint roaming access to their subscribers. Qualified TWC Internet customers and Boingo subscribers can connect to secure WiFi networks at thousands of locations, including 25 high traffic airports in the U.S.
  

   Expanding options for its customers us important as alternatives to cable and satellite TV profilerate. While TWC carries competitors such as Netflix and Hulu via its ISP, such services could eat into TWC's more profitable cable business. Another potential problem for TWC is the Federal Communications Commission's vote to regulate the Internet like a utility. That could prevent TWC and its competitors (or eventual partner, Comcast) from finding sources of revenue in different tiers of service.
  

   The company is focused on improving the quality and reliability of its residential products and offering distinguished customer service. TWC expects to see continued strong growth in its business services segment; it predicts revenue of more than $5 billion from those offerings by 2018.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   Acquisitions have played their part in TWC's strategy. In 2014, the company closed its acquisition of DukeNet Communications. The $600 million purchase bolstered TWC's business services wholesale transport offerings by adding some 8,700 route miles in the southeastern US to the company's fiber optic network.

Shuts v Covenant Holdco LLC

Case No. A132805 (CA Dist. 1 Ct. App., Aug. 15, 2012)


I. 

INTRODUCTION 

Appellants Cameron Shuts and Gary Sterling represent a putative class of former and current residents of 16 separately licensed skilled nursing facilities that are in the business of providing long-term, 24-hour care for the elderly and disabled (hereafter plaintiffs). Respondents are interrelated business entities that own and operate the skilled nursing facilities (hereafter collectively referred to as Covenant). Plaintiffs sued Covenant alleging, among other things, that it consistently and intentionally failed to provide adequate nursing staff for its elderly and disabled residents, and that Covenant misrepresented its staffing levels to residents and to the consuming public. Plaintiffs alleged three causes of action in their first amended complaint (FAC): (1) violation of a skilled nursing resident‟s right to reside in an adequately staffed facility (Health & Saf. Code § 1430, subd. (b)); (2) violation of California‟s unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. & Prof. Code, § 17200 et seq.); and (3) violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code, § 1750 et seq.).   

Plaintiffs alleged that the inadequacy of the staffing levels at Covenant‟s facilities was demonstrated by its noncompliance with the statutory mandate that a skilled nursing facility maintain a minimum numeric ratio of 3.2 nursing hours per patient per day (NHPPD). (See § 1276.5, subd. (a).) Covenant filed a demurrer, urging the court to dismiss this dispute because a skilled nursing facility‟s obligation to provide its residents care at a level of 3.2 NHPPD is not enforceable by a private right of action. It argued that because section 1276.5 is a regulatory statute, it can only be enforced by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). In addition, Covenant warned that litigating the case would necessarily involve the court in a “regulatory 'thicket‟'of nursing home staffing regulation[s]” that is best left to administrative expertise. Covenant urged the court to dismiss based on the abstention doctrine. The trial court agreed with both arguments, and dismissed plaintiffs‟ lawsuit without leave to amend.   

In the published portion of this opinion we first conclude that while section 1276.5, subdivision (a), may not create a private right of action, section 1430, subdivision (b) does, thereby allowing plaintiffs to sue under this latter statute for a violation of section 1276.5, subdivision (a). As to the court‟s invocation of the abstention doctrine, at this stage of the proceedings, it is not clear that adjudicating plaintiffs‟ claims “would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency, or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency. [Citations.]” (Alvarado v. Selma Convalescent Hospital (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1298 (Alvarado).) Even if otherwise appropriate, the FAC contained nonequitable claims for relief, including damages, that are not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of equitable abstention. Therefore, we reverse the demurrer as to plaintiffs‟ first cause of action seeking relief under section 1430, subdivision (b). In the nonpublished portion of this opinion we likewise reverse the trial court‟s dismissal of the UCL and CLRA causes of action.
