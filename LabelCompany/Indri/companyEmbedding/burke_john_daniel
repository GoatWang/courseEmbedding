Publisher's Description▼▲
What is spiritual direction and my spiritual direction? What are my "blind spots" and how can I uncover them? What keeps me from all the spiritual riches Christ has for me? How can I better understand where I am in my spiritual progress?  Daniel Burke's Navigating the Interior Life will give you the tools you need to understand how and why we grow and die in the spiritual life and what we can do about it.

Daniel C. Burke

Daniel C. Burke earned his bachelor’s degree in 1990 from the State University of New York at Albany (B.A., English/History), and earned his J.D. in 1993 from St. John’s University School of Law, where he was a member of St. John’s Journal of Legal Commentary.
Mr. Burke was recognized as a leader in the areas of class actions and mass torts by Super Lawyers magazine for the fifth straight year from 2013-2017.  In addition, he was named as one of the National Trial Lawyers Top 100 for 2014, and one of the Nation’s Top One Percent by the National Association of Distinguished Counsel in 2015.
Mr. Burke’s practice is focused on mass tort pharmaceutical, medical device and consumer products litigation. He has actively litigated high-profile cases on behalf of thousands of injured plaintiffs in cases involving prescription drugs including Yaz/Yasmin and Plavix, medical devices such as the Biomet M2a Magnum hip prosthesis and Zimmer Nexgen knee prosthesis, as well as consumer products including Fixodent and Poligrip denture adhesives and ReNu with MoistureLoc contact lens solution. He has supervised the day-to-day management of complex, multi-party mass tort litigation in state and federal courts and multi-district litigation throughout the United States.
In recognition of his extensive experience in these areas by his peers and the Courts, he has been invited to serve in a number of leadership positions in many successful mass tort litigation cases including the Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in In re: Biomet M2a Magnum Hip Implant Products Liability Litigation (MDL 2391), Liaison Counsel in the New York Coordinated Plavix-Related Proceedings (Index No. 560001/12), Plaintiffs’ Steering Committee in In re: Zimmer Nexgen Knee Implant Products Liability Litigation (MDL 2272), Discovery and Law & Briefing Sub-Committees for In re: Denture Cream Products Liability Litigation (MDL. 2051); and the Science and Discovery Sub-Committees for In re: Yasmin & Yaz (Drospirenone) Marketing, Sales Practices & Products Liability Litigation (MDL 2100).
Currently, Mr. Burke is representing plaintiffs in a wide array of drug litigations including those involving PPIs (Nexium, Prilosec, Prevacid), Zofran, Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics, Testosterone Replacement Therapy, Incretins (Onglyza/Kombiglyze), Mirena IUD, Actos, Fosamax, Xarelto, Taxotere and Risperdal.  Additionally, he is litigating matters involving medical devices including Bair Hugger Forced Air Warming Blankets, IVC Filters, Defective Hip, Knee, Shoulder & Elbow Implants, Transvaginal and Hernia Mesh and Power Morcellators.  He is also investigating consumer product claims related to various cancers caused by Cell Phone Radiation and the use of Talc, as well as injury claims on behalf of infants who used Teething Tablets.
Mr. Burke is admitted to the Bar of the State of New York. He is also admitted to practice before the United States District Courts for the Southern, Eastern and Northern Districts of New York, and he is frequently admitted pro hac vice to represent clients in various state and federal courts throughout the United States.

Trek Bicycle president slams Trump on corporate taxes, failed leadership, and 'America First theory'

John
  Burke, the president of Trek Bicycle Corp.

  The president of North America's largest bicycle manufacturer has
  slammed President Donald Trump over his 
  corporate-tax reform, failed leadership, and misguided
  "America First theory."


  John Burke, the head of Waterloo, Wisconsin-based Trek Bicycle Corp., lambasted Trump
  during an interview with Business Insider on Thursday, saying he
  missed a huge opportunity to simplify a complicated tax system
  and has failed to lead the country.


  "We're 100 days in and he finally comes out with a tax plan — and
  it was 250 words? And there was no bad news," Burke said. "Here's
  this huge opportunity to simplify everything and to have massive
  change, and you get 250 words."


  While Trump's tax plan contains broad outlines rather than firm
  legislative text, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National
  Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said the plan would include
  "the biggest tax cut" in US history, echoing statements made by
  Trump.


  Trek, a family-owned company, was cofounded by Richard Burke,
  John's father, in a Waterloo barn in 1976. Today it is a global
  bike business worth over $1 billion, and it employs 2,000 people
  worldwide. It makes a variety of bikes, including kids' bikes,
  mountain bikes, and high-end road bikes. It also owns the
  Trek-Segafredo team that competes in
  the Tour de
  France.


  Burke, who says he is neither a Republican nor a Democrat but an
  independent, is the author of "12 Simple Solutions to
  Save America," published in 2016, which "challenges Americans
  to resist the status quo and change what elected officials are
  unwilling or unable to change."

  Wisconsin.

  McMahon/Business Insider





  "Look, I don't need a tax break — Trek doesn't need a tax break,"
  Burke told Business Insider. "We're going to succeed and fail in
  the market based on how good our products are and how good our
  services are. As a member of the community, we have a moral duty
  to be a good corporate citizen, and one way you're a good
  corporate citizen is you pay your taxes."


  Burke added that, from a competitive standpoint, American
  corporate taxes should come down — but so should all the
  deductions. And while he did praise Trump for reducing the number
  of tax brackets, he criticized him for not getting rid of
  corporate deductions altogether.


  "You have General Electric, a great American company, which made
  a profit of $12 billion. They filed a 57,000-page tax return and
  paid zero in taxes.


  "So if you want to reduce corporate taxes, that's fine, reduce
  them," Burke went on, "but Trump wants to reduce them from 35% to
  15%, and I think that's too big a decline. But then he doesn't
  want to get rid of any of the deductions?


  "Why do oil companies get deductions and bicycle companies don't?
  Why do certain industries get deductions and shoemakers don't?
  The brewer doesn't get a deduction. It doesn't make sense. You're
  leaving in place this super-complicated tax system.


  "So it's treats for everybody. For corporate America, you get a
  lower rate, and you get to keep your deductions. And for all the
  individual taxpayers, you get a lower rate.


  "We're 19 trillion frickin dollars in debt and everybody got a
  treat. And I just go, 'You're kidding me.' You call that
  leadership? I don't."


  On misguided 'America First theory'


  Burke also criticized Trump on his leadership of the country.


  "When you're the president of the United States and you come out
  with this 'American First' theory, what are you saying to the
  rest of the world?


  "I've been so fortunate here in growing the business. When I
  started here, we were doing $16 million and now we do over a
  billion dollars, and I've worked with an incredible team to do
  that. We took the business from just being in the US to right now
  — 60% of our business is around the world.

  "And one of the reasons why American is as strong as it is, is
  there are a lot of great American companies who have access to
  markets all around the world — General Electric, Coca-Cola,
  Apple, Trek, Harley-Davidson.


  "The whole 'American First' thing ... I just don't find that
  conducive to America's future or anyone else in the world."


  Lack of leadership


  "The best definition I ever heard of leadership is, leadership is
  the ability to make the dream a reality at the grassroots level,"
  Burke added. "But leadership is also, 'Here's the vision, and I'm
  going to convince people where we need to go.' And what we've
  come to in American politics is saying, 'Well, I need to get
  elected, so I'm going to tell all these people whatever they want
  to hear.'


  "You know, if you're the richest person on the playground and
  you're the biggest person on the playground ... you know, we
  usually lead like, 'Talk softly and carry a big stick,' and when
  we're walking around with a blow horn, that's not the way we
  roll.


  "We're a leader in the world, but to maintain that status over
  the long haul, you actually need a leader who can look at the
  people and say, 'You know, we've got problems here' — and whether
  your talking about tax codes, gun control, nuclear proliferation,
  big issues — 'Here are the problems, and here are the solutions,
  and this is why we need to do it.'


  "And more than just a sound bite, we've got to educate people and
  say, 'This is why we need to move here.' And I think we lack that
  right now, and I think we've lacked it for a while."




President
  Trump.
Thomson
  Reuters




  Trump once sponsored the biggest bike race in America —
  the Tour de
  Trump — which ran for two years, 1989-1990, before being
  taken over by DuPont.


  Trump's proposal did not include a large number of key details,
  including the income levels associated with a new three-bracket
  tax system, the tax rate for a one-time repatriation of corporate
  profits held overseas, and others.


  Here are the key points of the Trump plan:



Corporate tax rate of 15%: Such a rate would
    deliver on Trump's campaign promise. 
    The current federal statutory rate is 35%.
  

Allows pass-through rate for business owners:
    Instead of self-owned businesses being taxed at the personal
    income rate, business owners would have incomes from operations
    taxed at the 15% rate. So if you own your own business, income
    from that business would be taxed at the corporate rate.
    According to The New York Times, that could apply to the Trump
    Organization.
  

No border-adjustment tax:
    The tax on imports was favored by House GOP leaders such as
    Speaker Paul Ryan and Kevin Brady, the chair of the Ways and
    Means Committee. Mnuchin said the White House talked to Ryan
    and Brady but thought the tax did not "work in its current
    form."
  

A slight adjustment to individual tax rates:
    White House officials said there would be three tax brackets
    with rates of 35%, 25%, and 10%, down from the current seven
    brackets. Cohn told reporters that he did not have the exact
    incomes associated with the brackets.
  

Doubling of the standard individual tax
    deduction: This would allow individual filers to
    deduct their first $12,700 in income from their taxes and
    $25,400 for joint filers, as opposed to the current $6,350 for
    individuals and $12,700 for joint filers.
  

A one-time repatriation tax: This would allow
    companies to bring back money from overseas to the US with a
    slightly lower, one-time tax. The White House did not clarify
    the rate at which this money would be taxed. President George
    W. Bush enacted a repatriation tax at a 5.25% rate in 2004, but
    studies show the money brought back 
    mostly went to stock buybacks and dividends rather than
    hiring workers.
  

Elimination of the estate tax: This would
    eliminate a tax on assets being transferred through a will.
  

Elimination of itemized tax deductions other than
    charitable donations and mortgage payments: Mnuchin
    said this provision would close "loopholes" and offset the
    decrease in base tax rate for high income Americans.
  

Repeal a 3.8% tax on net investment income:
    The tax was levied on "individuals, estates and trusts" with
    higher than a certain threshold in investment income. For
    instance, 
    the threshold for an individual was $200,000 in investment
    income last year.
  

Repeal the alternative minimum tax: This tax
    requires some people who have large numbers of deductions to
    calculate their income tax under the normal tax rate and the
    alternative and pay the higher amount. According to the Tax
    Policy Center, the tax was originally designed to eliminate
    large deductions by wealthier people, but now applies to about
    5 million people.
  

No infrastructure spending:
    Reports on Tuesday said Trump was considering including
    infrastructure spending in the plan to try to win over
    Democrats. Mnuchin denied the report in the speech, saying the
    proposal would be "just a tax plan."
