Strategy

Special Situations Strategy
Structured Credit Strategy



Special Situations
				Candlewood 's special situations platform consists of opportunistic credit strategies focused on event-driven / distressed investing.  The investment objective is to provide total return, predominantly through capital appreciation, by investing primarily in the debt of companies or pools of assets that are expected to restructure, enter bankruptcy or liquidate. As a point of entry, the strategies will usually invest in debt instruments trading at a substantial discount to par value. The team expects to hold a portion of these investments through the bankruptcy or restructuring process and may receive part, if not all, of an investment's recovery in the form of post-reorganized equity. The team may also invest in the debt of companies or structured products where the underlying collateral is currently in runoff or liquidation. During periods of low defaults and restructuring activity, a larger portion of the strategies' assets may be invested in other value based investments, liquidating investments or performing credit than during periods of high corporate defaults. In addition to performing and nonperforming debt, the strategies may invest in equities, options and credit derivatives.


Structured Credit
					Candlewood's structured credit platform is focused on stressed and distressed structured credit.  The strategies take a multi-sector approach to the structured credit universe.  The team looks for strong risk-adjusted returns across RMBS, CMBS, and other ABS sectors such as small business loans, aircraft operating leases, student loans and ABS CDOs.  This diversification also helps to mitigate any adverse risk profile that can result from over-concentration within a single asset class.  The strategy takes an active approach to trading, helping monitor liquidity and depth across the sectors in which the strategy invests.  The team focuses on cash flow modeling, asset valuation, relative value, and collateral performance and is able to leverage off Candlewood's broad credit platform.
