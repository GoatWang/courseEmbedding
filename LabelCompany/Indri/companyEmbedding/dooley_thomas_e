Dr. America: The Lives of Thomas A. Dooley














  












 


Dr. America: The Lives of Thomas A.
  Dooley, 1927-1961, by James T. Fisher, University of Massachusetts Press,
  1997, 304 pages, reviewed by James Sullivan,  Culture Wars, February 1998
  ractically
  everybody in my generation has a Tom Dooley anecdote. My brother-in-law, for
  example, told me that his decision to become a physician "was greatly
  influenced" by the Jungle Doctor. "Whatever happened to him,"
  he added, alluding to that brief period (1955-1960) when Dooley became a
  legend in a corner of the world known as Southeast Asia, and then seemed to
  disappear.
  On June 5, 1960, Dr. Tom Dooley received an
  honorary doctorate from the University of Notre Dame, upstaging such
  eminences on the podium as Giovanni Cardinal Montini, Archbishop of Milan
  (three years away from becoming Pope Paul VI), and President Dwight D.
  Eisenhower. "Where's Tom Dooley," said Eisenhower to Theodore
  Hesburgh, President of Notre Dame, "I want to talk to him." They
  did talk. All through lunch Dooley told Eisenhower about his MEDICO operation
  in Laos. Six months later, on January 18, 1961, he would die in a hospital
  bed in New York City, the victim of cancer. Kneeling alone by his bedside,
  praying the rosary, was Teresa Gallagher, a girl from Queens, unmarried, a
  secretary at Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dooley's confidant and volunteer
  secretary.
  My own remembrance of Dooley was bound up
  with Junior year of high school, 1964. I had just transferred to the Catholic
  school in the city from the public school in the suburbs. Sister Mary
  Magdalene, my homeroom teacher, a tall woman, lean and taught with high cheek
  bones and a reddened face that flashed out from her starched mantle, adored
  Tom Dooley. He was, she told those of us in Room 317, the Catholic model whom
  we should emulate. In my mind, now, it's hard to separate Dooley from Sister
  Mary Magdalene. Her presentation of him to the class always had an underlying
  aspect of nervous anxiety. This agitated enthusiasm made Dooley difficult to
  approach, giving him a higher than thou quality. As I grew older and lived
  through the upheavals of post conciliar Catholicism, I looked back on those
  days in Room 317 and wondered if the frenetic action-apostolate that Sister
  Mary Magdalene espoused, didn't also contain a certain disease, a
  presentiment of trouble underneath.
  Dr. America has helped to shed light on the
  cause of my vague feelings of disturbance in Room 317. It has also revealed a
  great deal about Tom Dooley that very few of us could know in 1964, things
  that would have rung with a hard dissonance when compared to the hagiographic
  portrait that was then drawn of the Doctor in Catholic circles. This book
  also confirms his many admirable qualities, ones that Sister Mary Magdalene
  was not slow to point out to her charges in Room 317.
  Tom Dooley was, in the words of James T.
  Fisher "a complex individual who persisted in the effort to reconcile
  wildly conflicting impulses, for the sake of his audience as well as for
  himself." He had a devotional side, including frequent Mass attendance,
  recitation of the rosary, and a devotion to the Little Flower. On the other
  hand , he was an active homosexual, who, according to classmate Michael
  Harrington never attempted to hide his same-sex orientation. Even after
  cancer surgery in 1960, Dooley resorted to the 2nd floor of Bangkok's Erawan
  Hotel, a "central preserve of his gay life in Southeast Asia." While
  his memory is enshrined at Notre Dame with a plaque of one of his letters to
  Father Hesburgh at the Grotto, he left the University without receiving a
  degree, and was restive of school authority while there. A charismatic
  speaker, who could bring any audience to tears with his uncanny ability to
  portray the suffering Vietnamese and Laotian people, he traveled first-class
  and ran up a lavish tab at the Waldorf when he was in town.
  While Dooley attained to an iconic status
  not only among American Catholics, but the wider society as well, he was also
  an instrument in the hands of the (so called) Vietnam Lobby, a group of
  public relations executives, former socialists turned anti- communist,
  shadowy military figures and CIA operatives. These folks, none of whom were
  Catholic, ardently desired a Catholic figure who might be a bridge from
  American non-sectarian anti-communism to the fiercely Catholic leader in
  South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem. Indeed, if this book has a sub-plot, it centers
  on the creation of Dr. Tom Dooley by a coalition of secular humanitarians and
  Madison Avenue types ("Ivy Leaguers", to borrow a pejorative from
  Senator McCarthy), for the purpose of exporting a vision of a pluralistic
  democracy (unfreighted with any religious baggage) to a corner of the world
  known as Indochina. And if this sub-plot has an underlying theme, it is that
  these same anti- communist liberals were also an anti-Catholic elite who
  found themselves in the queer position of defending an intransigently
  Catholic president in South Vietnam. While most of the radical liberals of
  the 60's (the New Left) thought the Vietnam War was a product of the
  machinations of the State Department and Cardinal Spellman, Fisher shows how
  Dooley's handlers-recondite names like, Leo Cherne, Joseph Buttinger, Harold
  Oram, and Angier Biddle Duke-were themselves on the anti-Catholic side of the
  ethno- religious wars of the late '50s.
  Dooley
  almost lost a medical career entirely. Graduating near the bottom of his
  class at St. Louis University Medical School he was forced to repeat his
  senior year. Even worse, he was deemed too immature to begin a residency and
  was required to extend his internship an additional six months. Impulsive and
  rebellious, habitually late or absent from class, Tom was far likelier to be
  found at the Bridlespur Hunt Club than in the amphitheater of the medical
  school; horses, not cadavers were what people remember about him during these
  years. Still, through some powerful pleading from two St. Louis physicians,
  Tom obtained an appointment in April, 1953 to the Navy Medical College as a
  lieutenant. He was about to walk on to the world stage.
  Dooley's assignment on the USS Montague
  brought him to Vietnam in the late summer of 1954. The French had been
  defeated by the communist Viet Minh at the battle of Dien Bien Phu earlier in
  the Spring. The protocols at Geneva in July of 1954 allowed the transfer of
  inhabitants of North and South Vietnam who desired to relocate to one sector
  or the other. This window would remain open until May of 1955. Thus commenced
  the flight of refugees from North Vietnam to South Vietnam known as Operation
  Passage to Freedom. Arriving on the USS Montague, Lieutenant Dooley was
  assigned to act as an interpreter between the French, on whose vessels the
  Catholic and anti-communist refugees from the North were being delivered, and
  the Americans who were providing the LSM's, landing craft which would ferry
  the refugees to safe harbor in the South. Although the United States refused
  to sign the Geneva accords of 1954, there was a strong desire on the part of
  Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to cooperate in the refugee effort and
  demonstrate to the world the resolve of America to stop the spread of
  communism in Southeast Asia.
  Although Dooley was strongly anti-communist,
  with a view that linked the political liberation of Catholics in North
  Vietnam with a Catholic philosophy which saw the destructive implications of
  dialectical materialism, he also realized the opportunities for
  self-promotion which the refugee operation would afford him. To Fisher, the
  Dooley of Operation Passage to Freedom was a person determined to recoup his
  reputation after the medical school debacle. No sooner is he involved in
  boarding the refugees onto the LSM's than he found time to send letters to
  the St. Louis Globe-Democrat recounting as newsworthy the refugee operation.
  In letters home to his mother he also confides that he is an operative of the
  US Navy, sent to help set up an epidemiological laboratory for the study of
  various indigenous parasites and bacteria.
  Yet Dooley's own efforts to enhance his
  image were outdone by others who found him terribly useful to their purposes.
  There was Lt. Col. Edward Lansdale, an iconoclast and a loner, who was given
  a wide berth by C.I.A. regulars, yet was specifically requested by Allen
  Dulles, CIA Director, to be the man on the ground who could help Diem. A
  former ad executive from San Francisco, Lansdale was in South Vietnam
  awaiting Diem's arrival. Yet he needed a way of making the authoritarian Diem
  palatable to a stateside audience that had grown weary of the protracted
  involvement of America in the Korean conflict. In Dr. Tom Dooley, Lansdale
  found the kind of young go-getter, who could be a conduit between the
  Catholic refugees in the North and the wise-cracking American journalists
  both in Vietnam and back home who could see a human interest story when it
  came their way.
  There also was the International Rescue
  Committee (IRC) and the American Friends of Vietnam (AFV), two organizations
  described by James Fisher as made up of "leftist entrepreneurs bent on
  expanding their markets abroad in the immediate post-McCarthy era."
  Imbued with a "messianic liberalism," the two groups had
  interlocking memberships, and were made up in many instances of former
  socialists who had shed their anti-fascist orientation and now turned
  anti-communist. Harold Oram, for example, was head of the American Friends of
  Vietnam, an organization that boasted John F. Kennedy and Mike Mansfield, two
  notable Catholic democrats. Yet Oram did publicity work for Planned
  Parenthood and hired Peter White, grandson of the renowned New York
  architect, Stanford White, to work on the Diem account. Peter White and his
  wife, both Catholics, had a large family and were part of the Catholic
  intellectual revival of the post war years. Their friends included the
  writers Sally and Robert Fitzgerald, and Edward Rice, founding editor of
  Jubilee, a Catholic monthly of high church graphics and literary and
  theological brightness.
  White also tried to deliver the liberals of
  Commonweal to Diem's cause, but many of them were in full-flight from the
  specter of Joe McCarthy and his perceived American Catholic power base.
  Writing in Commonweal in 1954, James O'Gara warned that "the hard core
  of Catholic support for McCarthy...has the same emotional roots as support
  for Father Coughlin in the thirties." Catholic liberals of the period
  were also alarmed about outbreaks of anti- Semitism coming from the Right.
  But Fisher concludes "that the McCarthyites reserved their greatest
  scorn not for Jews but the Anglo elites...the East Coast aristocrats who
  populated the IRC." According to Fisher, "the culture wars of the
  period were fought primarily between Catholics and a rather loosely defined
  coalition of liberal Protestants, Jews, and assorted secularists who saw the
  growing Catholic population as a threat to their cherished notions about a
  wall separating church and state ... since the Church appeared monolithic in
  its authority, Catholicism was generally equated with what would only later
  be tagged the 'religious right'."
  In Dooley, Leo Cherne, director of the IRC
  and Harold Oram saw a Catholic superstar who appeared to combine on the one
  hand, a devotional Catholicism which linked him to traditional sources of Catholic
  piety yet also reflected a "newer" Catholic internationalist
  spirit. While anti-communist, Dooley would have the theological tint of a
  low-key ecumenist who could speak across the cultural divide.
  The refugee operation in Vietnam was
  recounted in Dooley's first book, Deliver Us From Evil. In Fisher's view, the
  book was nothing less than a propaganda piece "pure and simple."
  Although there is evidence to show that the editors at Reader's Digest
  Condensed Books sought to shape the book and Operation Passage to Freedom as
  the story of "one lone American doctor," it is not clear who may
  have been directing the book deal initially. Lansdale had gotten the National
  Order of Vietnam for Dooley, presented to him by Diem in May of 1956, and
  Lansdale's friend, William Lederer, co-author ofThe Ugly American, received a
  note from DeWitt Wallace thanking him for steering Dooley to the Digest. Even
  at the time of the book's publication, however, FBI files disclose that
  individuals who had worked with Dooley complained that he had minimized the
  help that the French had given in the operation, and that the book was a
  product of self-aggrandizement.
  Dooley's Navy career came to an end on March
  28, 1956. Under investigation for homosexual activity by the Office of Naval
  Intelligence (ONI), he was forced to resign. Reports of his homosexuality had
  been circulating since the summer of 1954; it was rumored that he had seduced
  the son of an admiral during a stay at Yokosuka, Japan, just before shipping
  out to Vietnam. The ONI probe began in January, 1956. By March of that year,
  they had compiled a convincing dossier on Dooley, including sex acts with
  informants, and were about to proceed against him when he abruptly resigned.
  Admirers of Dooley have suggested that he may have had "tendencies"
  yet sought to live chastely. Even Randy Shilts, who outed Dooley in a book in
  1989 on homosexuals in the military, believed that Dooley led a deliberately
  closeted life because he adhered strictly to the teachings of the Church. Yet
  both of these views are wrong. Fisher states: "he (Dooley) was in fact
  an extraordinarily active gay man who was considered one of the great sex
  symbols of his era — a figure well-known in sophisticated gay circles as
  far-flung as Hollywood, Washington, D.C., and the capitals of Southeast
  Asia."
  Working in Bethesda, Maryland as a hospital
  intern in 1952, Dooley was picked up by a German airline steward who took him
  to the home of one of the leading Washington homosexuals. Dooley quickly
  became a favorite of the group which included theater people and musicians.
  Rock Hudson's future manager was among them. Dooley was described within gay
  circles as "mesmerizing" and "one of the most charming people
  you would ever want to meet." The topic of Dooley's homosexuality remained
  hidden from public scrutiny; this was the mid 1950s after all. Yet, Fisher
  quotes one unnamed source as saying that Dooley told him that the Catholic
  Church's teaching on homosexuality "was simply wrong." Another
  source revealed that Dooley regarded his homosexuality "as a gift,"
  that homosexual relations were, for him, a way to elevate the gray existence
  of those not so blessed with charm and good looks. Toward the end of his
  life, Dooley's appeals for support in his clinics in Laos contained what Fisher
  calls a "homoeroticized mysticism." And the Doctor's recruitment of
  young men, especially at Notre Dame, make us wonder about the roots of what
  will later be termed "the homosexual network" in the Catholic
  Church in America.
  


The topic of Dooley's homosexuality remained hidden from
    public scrutiny; this was the mid 1950s after all. Yet, Fisher quotes one
    unnamed source as saying that Dooley told him that the Catholic Church's
    teaching on homosexuality "was simply wrong." 



  As Dooley's naval career was
  self-destructing, his new role of Jungle Doctor was about to take off. The
  presses were rolling out the pages of Deliver Us From Evil just as the ONI
  was tightening its investigation. Within three weeks after his resignation from
  the Navy, Dooley announced to a reporter who had questioned him about his
  Navy status, "next September under the auspices of the International
  Rescue Committee I'm returning for six months to Laos....Walt Disney has
  given me a little movie projector....we're going to take lots of white sailor
  hats, baseballs, ball-point pens... and Sears Roebuck catalogs to show these
  people a little bit of what America is like."
  Leo Cherne admired Dooley. Unlike William J.
  Casey, Cherne's Irish Catholic protege, Dooley had a cosmopolitan flair.
  Cherne and Dooley had classical music in common. Dooley could entertain on
  the piano-a poor man's George Shearing-and weave popular melodies and
  classical motifs together. His suits were European cut. Cherne told Casey
  biographer, Joseph E. Persico, that his understudy was "to the right of
  Attila the Hun...one hundred per cent for Franco and one hundred per cent
  against the Loyalists. To understand this you had to understand his
  Catholicism." In Dooley, Cherne found no vestiges of the ethno-religious
  conflicts of the 1930s that sometimes marked relations between the Irish and
  the Jews in New York. Dooley was a new kind of Catholic, and not unlike
  Cherne, looking to "win acclaim with cultural and political
  elites." Both men felt themselves to be deserving of "insider"
  status. Cherne would accomplish this as a seasoned pro within the sector of
  humanitarian aid projects, while Dooley would do this by his "pretty
  brilliance" as Catholic folk hero.
  Dooley's homosexuality was known to the IRC.
  Angier Biddle Duke had been informed by Admiral Burke about the ONI
  investigation but was assured that "it won't be a problem for you."
  Based on Dooley's habits, one wonders why the Admiral had such confidence;
  nevertheless, other things worried Duke, in particular Dooley's spending
  habits and carelessness with receipts. When Duke attempted to caution Tom
  about the need to curtail excessive spending, which would threaten the
  tax-exempt status of the IRC, Dooley retorted with "chickenshit."
  Yet among Catholics, who had been inspired
  by Deliver Us From Evil, Dooley's charismatic power was intense. Sixth
  graders at Our Lady of Victory Academy in Tarrytown, New York wrote to Dooley
  to tell him that they were going "to adopt" a child from Southeast
  Asia and name him "Thomas Anthony." A third grader penned, simply:
  "You are just like Jesus." Placing his life within a gospel
  context, a nun from Tulsa, Oklahoma said that, "You can be certain that
  when you reach the end of the road you will hear the words of welcome from
  Our Divine Savior Himself, 'Come you blessed one and possess the kingdom of
  heaven...'" Sister M. Madeleva Wolff of Saint Mary's at Notre Dame wrote
  to Teresa Gallagher to say that Dooley had spent his finest hours by bearing
  the suffering "in his members" (referring to the cancer, which
  finally killed him).
  From 1956 through 1959, the IRC funded
  MEDICO, Dooley's clinic operations in Laos. MEDICO was never simply Dooley's
  private apostolate. Through its board and its connections with Washington foreign
  aid sources and later with the CIA, it was bigger than Dooley. Yet it also
  relied on Dooley's star-power. During sorties back to the States he undertook
  fabulously successful fundraising events. In Boston, Billy Sullivan, new
  owner of the fledgling Patriots football club, presented Dooley with a
  sterling silver tray. "Let's fill it," he challenged the audience,
  and people rushed up to litter the tray with bills of large denominations. On
  November 16, 1959, Dooley gave a memorable address at Hollywood High School,
  sponsored by Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles. The audience was
  overwhelmingly Catholic, including the actresses, Jeannette MacDonald and
  Eleanor Powell, both known for their commitment to Catholic causes. "We
  are not interested in conversions," said Dooley, casting an eye toward
  the president of IHM. "I have no desire, dear Sister, to make any of my
  happy little Buddhist monks into mackerel-snapping Irish Catholics." The
  audience roared in shock and delight, evidently aware, as Fisher correctly
  observes, that they were also praying at the end of Mass for the conversion
  of Russia and "the pagans" in communist dominated countries in
  Asia.
  Dooley's ability to combine cold war piety,
  yet also catch the wave of what would become post-conciliar religious
  indifferentism was a high-wire act in 1959. At the outset of the address at
  Hollywood High School, he had begun with imprecations to "the glory of
  God and St. Therese," yet, as Fisher suggests, his audience was also
  ready for "another message," one that would be fixed on his
  star-power, while putting in low-key any missiological responsibilities to
  the non-Christian world. Here, Dooley presages a theme which would recur
  throughout the '60s and '70s in Catholic circles; the triumph of an active life,
  unhinged from doctrinal and spiritual fonts. Surely, Dooley could not be
  labelled an "activist apostate," as many of his co-religionists
  would be in the late '60s; his faith, although warring was not yet his
  persona as a celebrity quite possibly served to fill a vacuum where the
  security of belief ought to have been.
  In 1959, Dooley underwent surgery for
  malignant melanoma. A mole had been removed from his chest in 1957, but by
  1959 the cancer had metastasized. By this time the IRC had decided to part company
  with MEDICO, a decision motivated as much by internal problems within its
  membership, as by Dooley's unpredictability. Yet Tom's faithful, led by
  Teresa Gallagher (now being paid by Met Life to be Dooley's secretary) and
  Paul Hellmuth, a Catholic and Boston lawyer from the prestigious firm of Hale
  and Doer, sought to help him to continue the work, relying on providence and
  the charisma of the now-ailing doctor. Dooley died on January 18, 1961 at
  Memorial Hospital in New York. Cardinal Spellman had visited him the day
  before, leaving with tears in his eyes. Kennedy would shortly sound the call
  for The Peace Corps and invoke Dooley's memory.
  In 1970, a priest began a movement to press
  for his canonization. It never achieved lift off. No doubt it would have
  given work to any number of Devils Advocates. Of course, the stalled
  canonization movement was in many respects a tribute to the Church, that in
  the matter of saint-making things proceed quietly, not by the engine of
  Madison Avenue. Not that this dead end would, itself, deny the good that Dr.
  Tom Dooley did. He was genuinely loved by the Laotian people, who dubbed him
  Thanh Mo America, Dr. America. And this love was definitely returned by
  Dooley. For all his vainglory, and self-centeredness, he did set personal
  high standards for MEDICO physicians, and sought to make of his Operation
  Laos, a people to people project. He serves, in a strange way, as a morality
  tale about the Catholic self-promoter. Having given a thousand performances
  before audiences all over the world, he died having failed to achieve any
  lasting, personal intimacy with others. His iconic role was a substitute for
  the homelier task of real friendship. Today, we see many lesser Catholic
  self-promoters, who can only dream about the corridors of power that Dooley
  travelled. Presidents, future popes, and premiers wanted to talk to Tom
  Dooley. Yet if the Jungle Doctor is today reduced to the marginalia of
  history (not to slight this excellent biography), where will those lesser
  promoters be remembered?
  The book sheds much light on the interstices
  between the humanitarian lobbyists and their organizations and the State
  Department and foreign service professionals that Dooley reserved his special
  ire. Fisher provides some needed revisionist history on the origins of U.S.
  involvement in South Vietnam and the sponsorship of Ngo Dinh Diem. Taking
  issue with the New Left variant, that the war was the product of the
  machinations of Cardinal Spellman and the U.S. foreign policy elites, Fisher
  reveals the web of old left anti-communists, themselves anti- Catholic in
  many respects, who attempted to build an ecumenical coalition to support the
  Catholic president of what they hoped would become a secular, pluralist,
  democracy in Southeast Asia. The question in all of this remains: were
  Catholics duped by the anti- communist agenda of people like Leo Cherne and
  Angier Biddle Duke? Was Vietnam a staging ground, not for a Christian
  confrontation with Communism but for the implementation of a pluralist
  democracy by foreign aid elites with impeccable liberal and socialist
  pedigrees?
  In Fisher's telling it, what might be called
  the "Catholic interest" was bent to serve the coalition of New
  Leader-type liberals. Dooley's non-denominational appeal was central in advancing
  this agenda, since the kind of power base that Leo Cherne wanted to establish
  would hardly have occurred if a markedly Catholic presence obtained.

Requiem for a Whale Rider by E. Michael Jones.
SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau died after the 12,000 pound bull killer whale
grabbed her from a feeding platform and dragged her underwater. Saying
"she died doing what she loved," her sister assured a reporter that
"Dawn wouldn't want anything done to the whale now blamed in her
death." The reason women risk their
lives by riding whales goes deeper. Riding whales in Florida, like riding bulls
in Minoan Crete, is a religious ritual. As the image of Europa on the Bull
shows, riding an animal is a vaguely sexual act that bespeaks approval, but
also union, which confers on the rider the innocence of the ridden animal.
Finding only momentary relief from guilt, those burdened with an uneasy
conscience force themselves on the animals whose innocence and approval they
crave until an unpredictable mechanism goes off in the animal and the animal
kills the human who sought its approval. e-book. $2.99. Read
