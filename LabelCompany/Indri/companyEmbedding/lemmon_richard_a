The Murder of Mary Phagan
Movie Lover: Cassandra Cobb from
South Carolina -- May, 26, 2011
This movie was shown on TV back a few years ago and it stuck in my mind after seeing it. Based on the actual rape/murder case of 13 year old Mary Phagan, this was very well acted out. Peter Gallagher's performance as Leo M. Frank was accurate. The frustration of an innocent man being punished for a crime he never commited and those who tried to prove it is just as intense as it was back then. While the innocent man was lynched, the man who did it got away with his crime. This movie is well worth watching. I also suggest the book "And The Dead Shall Rise - The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank" by Steve Oney.
