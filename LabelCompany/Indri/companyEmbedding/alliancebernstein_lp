History[edit]
Origins[edit]
AB traces its origins back to the founding of Sanford C. Bernstein in 1967 as an investment-management firm for private clients. Sanford C. Bernstein & Company was originally co-founded by Zalman Bernstein, Paul P. Bernstein, Shepard D. Osherow, Roger Hertog and Lewis Sanders.[3]

2000–2015[edit]
In October 2000, Alliance Capital acquired Sanford C. Bernstein.[4] Alliance Capital's growth equity and corporate fixed-income investing, and its family of retail mutual funds, accompanied Bernstein's value equity and tax-exempt fixed-income management, and its private-client business.
It had about US$800 billion assets under management as of the end of 2007.[5]

The retail part of AB provides financial professionals and individual investors with the investment solutions, research, insights and tools that cover mutual funds, Managed Accounts, College Saving, Retirement Saving, and Insurance Services.[8]
Sell-side Research[edit]
Sell-side research and brokerage services are provided by wholly owned subsidiary Sanford C. Bernstein. It is also well known as Bernstein Research.[9]
Private Wealth Management[edit]
Bernstein Wealth Management, part of AB, provides investment and wealth-planning services for high-net-worth clients in the Americas[10]
529 Savings Plan[edit]
Rhode Island’s 529 savings plan, CollegeBoundfund®, was managed by AB and featured AB mutual funds until 2016.[11] It is now administered by Ascensus College Savings.[12]
