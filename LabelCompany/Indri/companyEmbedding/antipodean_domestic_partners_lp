The fund is predominantly a long/short fund that invests in global equities, but it may invest in other assets as well. At any time, the assets may include long or short positions in U.S. or foreign publicly-traded or privately-issued common stocks, preferred stocks, stock warrants and rights, corporate debt (including bank debt), bonds, notes or other debentures, convertible securities, options (purchased and sold), futures contracts, commodities, forward contracts, swaps and other derivative instruments, partnership interests and other securities or financial instruments including those of investment companies.In managing the fund, Antipodean seeks to provide investors with long-term compounded returns which outperform those of the broad market averages, while seeking to reduce the risk of exposure to the overall stock market and general macroeconomic factors through the use of an alpha focused long/short investment strategy. They also strive to minimize risk by monitoring both individual security risk and aggregations of risk (primarily by industry and geography) throughout the fund’s portfolio. Antipodean manages the volatility of returns through portfolio diversification, position sizing and their long/short investment strategy.
