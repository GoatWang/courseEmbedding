Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. Announces ICC-ES Approval for House Wrap Product | Business Wire


























































Alpha Pro Tech, Ltd. Announces ICC-ES Approval for House Wrap Product






March 19, 2008 04:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



VALDOSTA, Ga.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alpha Pro Tech (AMEX: APT), a leading manufacturer of products 
      designed to protect people, products and environments, including 
      disposable protective apparel and building products, today announced its 
      house wrap product for the construction industry has received the highly 
      coveted International Code Council-Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) approval. 
      The ICC-ES governs the International Building Code (IBC) which oversees 
      most building departments around the country. This approval 
      significantly expands the opportunity for Alpha Pro Tech’s 
      REX Wrap™ and REX Wrap Plus™ 
      house wrap products as many construction supply companies, as well as 
      builders and architects, require this certification to sell the product. 
      The size of the U.S. house wrap market is estimated at approximately 
      $1.0 billion.
    


      ICC-ES is the United States’ leader in 
      evaluating building products for compliance with code. A nonprofit, 
      public-benefit corporation, ICC-ES performs technical evaluations of 
      building products, components, methods, and materials. The evaluation 
      process culminates with the issuance of reports on code compliance, 
      which are made available free of charge to code officials, contractors, 
      specifiers, architects, engineers, and others with an interest in the 
      building industry and construction. ICC-ES evaluation reports provide 
      evidence that products and systems meet code requirements. The 
      International Code Council, a membership association dedicated to 
      building safety and fire prevention, develops the codes used to 
      construct residential and commercial buildings, including homes and 
      schools. Most U.S. cities, counties and states that adopt codes choose 
      the International Codes developed by the International Code Council 
      (ICC).
    

“We are pleased to have again received this 
      highly sought after ICC-ES approval for one of our products, this time 
      for our REX Wrap™ and REX Wrap Plus™ 
      house wrap product,” commented Danny 
      Montgomery, Senior VP Manufacturing of Alpha Pro Tech. “This 
      approval is the final milestone required to clear the product for 
      distribution throughout the construction industry. The approval, which 
      requires rigorous testing and inspection, also serves as a meaningful 
      validation of our product, demonstrating its technical capabilities and 
      ensuring construction companies that our housewrap will meet the latest 
      appropriate technical specifications. This also gives us full 
      accreditation with the architectural community as a leader in new and 
      innovative weatherization products that meet the newest code 
      requirements in the building industry. We are excited to have received 
      this approval, and look forward to reaching a larger and more receptive 
      audience. This approval, along with our ICC-ES approved REX Synfelt™ 
      synthetic roof underlayment product, paves the way for showing Alpha Pro 
      Tech’s full thrust into the weatherization 
      product packages that we currently offer.”
