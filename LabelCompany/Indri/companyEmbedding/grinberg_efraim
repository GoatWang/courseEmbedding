Movado is an American watchmaker best known for its Museum Watch. Designed in 1947 by Bauhaus-influenced artist Nathan George Horwitt, the watch dial has a very simple design dial defined by a solitary dot at 12, symbolizing the sun at high noon. It was first made by Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc., and later produced by Movado.[1] Horwitt's dial was selected for the permanent design collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1960, the first watch dial awarded this distinction.[2] The single dot dial now appears in many of Movado's timepieces.

History[edit]
Movado was founded as LAI Ditescheim & Freres SA in 1881 in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, by Léopold Achille Isidore Ditesheim. In 1983, the company was purchased by Gedalio Grinberg, a Cuban-born Jew, who fled Fidel Castro's Marxist Revolution in 1960 with his family.
His son, Efraim Grinberg, is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Movado Group, Inc. The North American President of Movado is Alan Chinich. In 2006, Movado celebrated its 125th year of watchmaking.
On February 23, 1999, Movado Group, Inc. completed the sale of Piaget business to VLG North America, Inc., for approximately $30 million.[3]

The company markets the Museum Watch, designed by the American designer Nathan George Horwitt in 1947. It was first manufactured by Vacheron & Constantin-Le Coultre Watches, Inc., Switzerland. Movado started producing an unauthorized version starting in 1948, copying Horwitt's design. It was added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in 1960. Movado finally settled with Horwitt in 1975 with a payment of $29,000 ($128,000 in 2015 dollars). Following Horwitt's death, Movado started heavy promotion of Horwitt and the design of the Museum Watch.[1][4][5] Photographer Edward Steichen called Horwitt's design "the only truly original and beautiful one for such an object".
Some Movado watch models have Esperanto names such as Bela ("beautiful"), Belamodo ("beautiful fashion"), Fiero ("pride"), Brila ("brilliant"), Linio ("line"), and Verto.[6] The company's name means "movement" in that language.
In November 2015, Movado announced the release of the Movado Motion collection of fine Swiss made watches, powered by the Manufacture Modules Technologies (MMT) MotionX technology platform. The collection includes the women’s Bellina and the men’s Museum Sport models.[7]

Movado's Efraim Grinberg - Watch Journal





























































 







Skip to content





Watch Journal 


All That's Good in Time.











Movado’s Efraim Grinberg


Efraim Grinberg, chairman and CEO of the Movado Group
Efraim Grinberg developed a love of watches naturally—he inherited it from his father, Gedalio “Gerry” Grinberg. The elder Grinberg founded the North American Watch Corporation, the US distributor for Piaget, which was the precursor to today’s Movado Group.
“I grew up in watches, thanks to my father,” Grinberg says. “I knew you could do a lot of things to make a living, but there were very few jobs where I could make products that I loved and have an emotional connection to the consumer.
“Watches are one of the great accessories that both men and women can wear,” he continues. “I am often asked if cell phones and smart phones will replace watches, and my answer is that there always have been more convenient and less expensive ways to tell time, yet people gravitate towards fine watches and it will continue to be this way. There are trends that come and go, but fine watches are here to stay.”
Grinberg looks forward to going to work each day, anxious to continue to work on the Movado Group brands (Movado, Ebel, Concord and ESQ Movado) and its licensed brands (Scuderia Ferrari, Hugo Boss, Juicy Couture, Tommy Hilfiger and Coach). “I love that I get to work with great brands, not just our brands but also our licensed brands, which are tremendous, iconic brands around the world,” Grinberg says. “There is a lot of love for these brands and we are fortunate that we can make their watches. I get inspired by all this and the creative people I get to work with.”
The creation of new products is one of the things Grinberg enjoys the most. “One of my favorite projects is the new Movado Edge collection, because we got to work with one of the world’s greatest industrial designers, Yves Béhar,” Grinberg details. “Béhar took the original Museum watch and figured out how to evolve it using the original as inspiration. I saw Béhar on a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival talking about design in the 21st century. I knew he grew up in Lausanne, Switzerland, so I introduced myself after the panel, and asked him if he ever thought about designing a watch. He said ‘yes’ with such enthusiasm, we started working on the project right away.”
Grinberg is bullish on the future of the watch industry, while acknowledging the challenges facing global brands. “There are always regions and countries that are growing and others that aren’t,” he says. “You can really see the instability in parts of the world – some areas have been very volatile. What we try to do is offer the consumer a tremendous amount of innovation.
“It’s important to me that people know that we have a long-term vision and we are very consumer focused,” he adds. “We listen to our consumers and we try to deliver products that they will love and have an emotional connection with. At a time when you are seeing a lot of utility in the watch category, it’s important for fine watches to have an emotional connection.”

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
