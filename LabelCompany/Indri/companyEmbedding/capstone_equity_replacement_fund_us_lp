Global private equity fundraising





Overview
Proven Success
Global Reach
Expertise
Commitment
Independence


With offices in North America, Europe and Asia, Capstone Partners is a leading placement agent providing global fundraising and advisory services to private equity, credit, real assets and infrastructure firms around the world.
Capstone’s network of relationships reaches out to active investors worldwide, enabling our fund manager clients to raise more quality capital, at a faster pace while minimizing the impact on their own professional staff.
The prior experience of our senior management team as seasoned marketers for and investors in private equity funds allows Capstone to anticipate issues that are important to prospective investors. We will look to identify and draw upon the specific strengths of each client to differentiate and best position them for a successful fundraising outcome.
The powerful combination of proven success, global reach, expertise, commitment and independence provide our clients a decisive advantage when competing for limited institutional investor allocations.




Established in 2001, Capstone Partners has built a successful track record in raising capital for both established and emerging fund managers.
We have built a history of success alongside private equity and real estate firms operating across all types of strategies and geographies. Capstone has a demonstrated success in international placement of venture capital, growth equity, mezzanine, buyout, turnaround, distressed, opportunistic, real estate and secondary strategies.
A further measure of Capstone’s success is the number of repeat mandates awarded to us by clients, with each successive mandate serving as an opportunity to leverage the wealth of knowledge and investor relationships formed in prior efforts. This combination of continuity, trust and an intimate understanding of our clients can lead to highly targeted, more efficient fundraisings, demonstrating the value of long-term relationships.
Our ability to close on commitments in all market cycles requires a highly disciplined approach and total commitment to the success of our clients in each placement mandate.




Capstone’s extensive network of relationships extends to active private equity and real estate investors in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. These relationships cross all types of large institutional investors including public and private pension funds, insurance companies, funds of funds, banks, consultants, foundations, endowments, family offices, asset managers, and corporate balance sheet investors.
Capstone provides clients with valuable insight into investor objectives and future anticipated trends in investment strategy and asset allocation. Capstone is constantly in the market, reaching out to both established and new prospective investors in private equity and real estate. Our systematic coverage provides us with a global perspective driven by local investor knowledge.
Capstone provides clients with access to qualified investors worldwide, without placing a significant drain on internal resources and without unnecessary distraction from their core business of managing portfolio investments.




Each Capstone client benefits from a deep institutional expertise across all areas of fund formation, management and fundraising. Contributing to that institutional expertise are several senior team members that have worked as principal investors, investing in 100+ funds, 20+ secondary transactions and 40+ direct investments.
We draw upon this invaluable experience to make a critical evaluation of each client, allowing them to differentiate themselves from their peers and present information in a way which will satisfy the demands of sophisticated institutional investors.
Capstone has developed and refined a well structured staged process to fundraising, enabling our fund manager clients to optimize fundraising effectiveness, timing and efficiency.
Capstone’s knowledge of the investor universe allows us to target those investors most qualified for the specific objectives of each of our clients. Each mandate is different, with its own unique characteristics and objectives. At Capstone, we recognize this and seek to tailor to each mandate a highly qualified group of prospective investors who can become long-term investing partners in support of each of our clients.
Capstone has developed state-of-the-art systems and reporting to ensure optimal impact and proper coordination throughout the fundraising process. Our clients are able to track the execution of the fundraising process as it unfolds and play a pro-active role in its successful conclusion.




Capstone is fully committed to the success of our clients. Our reputation, track record and source of income are dependent on this success. We have no other business activities nor are we funded by an institutional balance sheet. This creates a powerful bond and sharing of values with our clients, motivating all parties to make that extra effort to complete a successful fundraise.
Given this level of commitment and dedication to the success of our clients, Capstone takes on only a limited number of placement mandates every year. Great care is taken to avoid overlapping or conflicting mandates, and we only take on a new client relationship if we are confident of success.
“Success breeds success” and, at Capstone, our aim is to develop long-term client relationships over multiple fundraises. Not all investors will commit to the first fundraise but by working proactively with our clients over the long-term, we will establish a clear and consistent message which should lead to future successes through an increasingly efficient and timely process.
Through the careful and patient selection of placement mandates, Capstone has built a reputation within the investor community of providing a diversified and well- balanced offering of high quality private equity and real estate funds. Investors therefore listen to us and are attentive to our client offerings.




Capstone Partners is owned entirely by members of the team. Fundraising is our only business and we are entirely dedicated to the successful completion of a limited number of placement mandates. Our business model only works with successful outcomes for our clients.
Each mandate represents both a significant allocation of Capstone resources and a substantial economic event, ensuring our full commitment and a total alignment of interests with our clients. We aim to raise capital from qualified investors, working with integrity and free from conflicts of interest typically driven by “synergies” with other business activities.

KKR Closes US$13.9b Americas Private Equity Fund

March 6, 2017



 


KKR announced the final closing of KKR Americas XII Fund, a US$13.9b private equity fund focused on opportunistic investments in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
(Press Release) KKR, a leading global investment firm, today announced the final closing of KKR Americas XII Fund (“the Fund”), a US$13.9b fund focused on opportunistic investments in private equity-related transactions primarily in the United States, Canada and Mexico. KKR will be investing nearly US$1.4b in capital alongside investors through the Firm’s balance sheet and employee commitments.
“Throughout this period, we have invested through economic challenges and volatility but have remained focused on delivering top quartile performance. That continues to be our focus as we work hard to support our investors’ goals and the needs of their beneficiaries.”
“As we mark this important milestone in our Americas private equity business and close our 12th flagship private equity fund, we are grateful to our investors, both old and new, for their continued confidence in us. In today’s increasingly complex world, we are pleased that they share our enthusiasm for the opportunities that lie ahead in the Americas, in particular the U.S. where we anticipate significant long-term investment opportunities and where we have been investing for more than four decades and six economic cycles,” said Alexander Navab, KKR Member and Head of Americas Private Equity. “Throughout this period, we have invested through economic challenges and volatility but have remained focused on delivering top quartile performance. That continues to be our focus as we work hard to support our investors’ goals and the needs of their beneficiaries.”
Alisa Amarosa Wood, KKR Member and Head of Private Market Products Group, added: “Our optimism about the future, our team, and our belief that alignment is the best demonstration of our partnership, is why KKR is committing more money into this fund than any private equity fund in our history.”
KKR’s Americas private equity platform invests across seven industry teams, including Energy; Financial Services; Healthcare; Industrials; Media & Communications; Retail and Consumer; and Technology sectors. In addition to traditional management buyouts and build-ups, the business seeks to find opportunities to provide growth capital, as well as minority investments, and public toehold investments where KKR can partner with public companies, leveraging the Firm’s industry expertise and operational capabilities to add value beyond just providing capital. The Americas private equity team consists of over 60 experienced investment professionals, and is supported by over 20 operational executives in KKR Capstone.
Americas XII is the largest Americas-focused private equity fund, according to data sourced from Preqin. It received strong backing from a diverse group of new and existing global investors, including public and corporate pensions, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, private banking platforms, family offices and high net worth individual investors.
KKR has been investing in North America since the Firm’s establishment in 1976 and has been one of the most active private equity investors, having completed or announced over 225 transactions with a total enterprise value of approximately US$495b. Through 11 North America private equity funds, the Firm has invested approximately US$48.5b of equity in the Americas. Since inception, KKR’s first 18 private equity funds have delivered over two times total capital invested on a gross basis. This corresponds to a cumulative Gross IRR of 25.6% (net IRR of 18.9%) and a Gross multiple of 2.1x (net multiple of 1.9x). The predecessor fund of Americas XII, KKR North America Fund XI began investing in late 2012 and is now fully deployed. It has generated a Gross IRR of 24.0% (net IRR of 18.1%) and a Gross Multiple of 1.5x (net multiple of 1.4x) as of December 31, 2016. With the closing of this fund, KKR’s Americas private equity business manages approximately US$36b in assets under management.

KKR Capstone's Mission
KKR Capstone is an integral part of the overall firm’s approach to value creation. KKR Capstone’s core mission is to create value for all of our stakeholders by identifying and delivering sustainable operational performance within KKR portfolio companies. In support of this mission, KKR Capstone value creation activities are focused on three fundamental areas:
Assessing operational improvement opportunities and risks during the due diligence process
Delivering meaningful and sustainable operational change within the portfolio companies
Leveraging the scale and scope of the KKR portfolio to develop cross-portfolio programs that can benefit all investments
As of March 31, 2017, KKR Capstone is a team of approximately 50 full-time operating professionals dedicated to supporting KKR deal teams and portfolio companies.  It is one of the largest and most experienced operations firms within the alternative investment community.  With offices in the Americas, Asia and Europe, KKR Capstone has the capacity, capability, and scale to support complex, global businesses.
KKR Capstone Capabilities

KKR Capstone Approach
KKR Capstone teams are involved with KKR’s portfolio company investments through the entire life cycle of the asset.  KKR Capstone professionals work closely with investment teams during due diligence to identify operational value creation opportunities and then support boards and management teams to develop 100 day value creation plans.  Once the operational priorities are set, KKR Capstone teams deploy in partnership with management to support major transformational changes within portfolio companies.
The global KKR Capstone team targets improvements in both the income statement and balance sheet.  KKR Capstone projects are balanced between driving top-line growth, improving organizational efficiency, and optimizing capital productivity.  Given the size and experience of the KKR Capstone team, it has the capability to support portfolio companies across a very broad range of industries and functional areas.  Additionally, KKR Capstone has professionals dedicated to creating and managing cross portfolio programs – such as a shared procurement program – that are made available to all portfolio companies and provide fast-acting impact.

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Morningstar® is an independent service that rates mutual funds and other types of investments. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.



Automatic investment plans don't assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.



Asset allocation funds may change portfolio holding allocations on a frequent basis, resulting in high portfolio turnover and more brokerage commissions from an increased amount of the purchasing and selling of securities. The Fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a potentially lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy.

(known as USAA Financial Insurance Agency in California, License #0E36312), a registered investment adviser and insurance agency and its wholly owned subsidiary, USAA Financial Advisors, Inc., a registered broker dealer.



Lipper, Inc. is a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters. The Lipper Fund Awards program honors funds that have excelled in delivering consistently, strong risk-adjusted performance relative to its peers.
