ABOUT SHEILA BAIR

Sheila C. Bair is the President of Washington College, a historic liberal arts school located on Maryland’s scenic Eastern Shore. Washington College was founded in 1782 as the first college chartered in the new nation. George Washington helped found it with a donation of 50 guineas and served on its governing board for five years before becoming the first president of the United States. The College is known for the high quality, intimate educational experience it provides undergraduates, and for its nationally recognized centers focused on the environment, American history, and literature. Ms. Bair assumed office at the College on August 1, 2015.
Ms. Bair is perhaps best known for her service as the 19th Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for a five-year term, from June 2006 through July 2011.
Ms. Bair has an extensive background in banking and finance in a career that has taken her from Capitol Hill, to academia, to the highest levels of government. Before joining the FDIC in 2006, she was the Dean’s Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst since 2002.
Other career experience includes serving as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (1981 to 1988).
As FDIC Chairman, Ms. Bair presided over a tumultuous period in the nation’s financial sector, working to bolster public confidence and system stability. Determined not to turn to taxpayer borrowing during the crisis, the FDIC managed its losses and liquidity needs entirely through its traditional industry-funded resources. In response to the financial crisis, she developed innovative and stabilizing programs that provided temporary liquidity guarantees to unfreeze credit markets and increased deposit insurance limits. In 2007, she was a singular – and prescient — advocate for systematic loan modifications to stem the coming tidal wave of foreclosures. Ms. Bair also led FDIC resolution strategies to sell failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks’ troubled loans. That strategy saved the Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.
Under Ms. Bair’s leadership, the FDIC’s powers and authority were significantly expanded by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The law extends the FDIC’s resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions, effectively attacking the doctrine of too-big-to-fail. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored resolution plan, that it can be unwound.
Ms. Bair has been a leading domestic and international advocate for common-sense capital and leverage ratios, including backing a key provision in Dodd-Frank that requires large financial entities to have capital cushions at least as strong as those that apply to U.S. community banks. As a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, in 2006 she called for higher bank capital standards, including an international leverage ratio to constrain growing levels of leverage among the world’s major financial institutions. Financial experts now widely attribute excess leverage as a key driver of the 2008 financial crisis. In 2010, the Basel Committee finally adopted an international leverage ratio.
Ms. Bair’s work at the FDIC also focused on consumer protection and economic inclusion. Under her leadership, the FDIC issued early calls for interagency guidance addressing high-risk mortgages, and was among the first to see the dangers of these unaffordable mortgages to the broader banking sector and to the economy as a whole. She championed the creation of an Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion, seminal research on small-dollar loan programs, and the formation of broad-based alliances in nine regional markets to bring underserved populations into the financial mainstream.
Known for her focused and effective management style, FDIC employee morale soared under Chairman Bair’s leadership. Under her leadership, the FDIC achieved a #1 ranking of the “Best Places to Work in the Government for 2011,” among more than 200 comparable federal organizations. Moreover, her hands-on approach and strong emphasis on risk management led to the FDIC receiving an “unqualified,” or clean audit from the General Accounting Office (GAO) during every year of her term, a remarkable feat given the many demands on the agency for rapid expansion and loss exposure associated with the resolution of 370 failed banks representing over $650 billion in assets.
Ms. Bair received a number of prestigious honors during her tenure as FDIC Chairman. In 2008 and 2009, Forbes Magazine named Ms. Bair as the second most powerful woman in the world, after Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel. Also in 2008, Ms. Bair topped The Wall Street Journal’s annual 50 “Women to Watch List.” In 2009 she was named one of Time Magazine’s “Time 100″ most influential people; awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award; and received the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award. In 2010, Ms. Bair was featured on the cover of TIME Magazine with Mary Schapiro and Elizabeth Warren as “The New Sheriffs of Wall Street.” Also in 2010, she received the Better Business Bureau’s Presidents’ Award. In December of 2011, subsequent to leaving office, Ms. Bair was named by the Washington Post and Harvard University as one of seven of America’s Top Leaders.
A Kansan by birth, Chairman Bair received a bachelor’s degree from the University of Kansas in 1975 and a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. Ms. Bair was inducted into the University of Kansas Women’s Hall of Fame and received the Distinguished Kansan Award from the Native Sons and Daughters of Kansas in 2011. In May of 2012, she joined fellow KU alumni Robert Dole and Ford CEO Alan Mulally in Lawrence, Ks to receive the first honorary doctoral degrees ever granted by their alma mater. She also holds honorary doctorates from Amherst College and Drexel University.
Chairman Bair has also received several honors for her published work on financial issues, including her educational writings on money and finance for children, and for professional achievement. Among the honors she has received are: Distinguished Achievement Award, Association of Education Publishers (2005); Personal Service Feature of the Year, and Author of the Month Awards, Highlights Magazine for Children (2002, 2003 and 2004); and The Treasury Medal (2002). Her first children’s book, Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock, was published in 2006 and her second, Isabel’s Car Wash, in 2008.
Following her tenure as FDIC Chair, Ms. Bair joined the Pew Charitable Trusts as a Senior Advisor.  While at Pew, she chaired the Systemic Risk Council (SRC) a public interest group of prominent former government officials and leading financial experts which monitors progress on the implementation of financial reforms in the US. She is also a founding board member of the Volcker Alliance, a non-profit organization established by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker to promote more effective government. She serves on the prestigious International Advisory Council to the China Bank Regulatory Commission. In addition, she is a board member of the Rand Corporation.
Ms. Bair writes a regular column for Fortune Magazine on financial policy matters. She has written a New York Times best seller about her tenure at the FDIC, Bull By the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself, published in September of 2012. In April, 2015, she published a book for young adults about the financial crisis, Bullies of Wall Street, This is How Greedy Adults Messed Up Our Economy. She is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
Ms. Bair also serves on the board of Host Hotels, Thomson Reuters, and itBit USA.  She also serves as an advisor to DLA Piper, a global law firm. In addition, she engages in public speaking and maintains an active speaking calendar.  She speaks on a pro bono basis to nonprofits such as 501 c3′s and community groups. She charges a fee to for-profit entities, but does not accept fees from banks which the FDIC insures or bank holding companies which used the FDIC debt guarantee program during the crisis. She will speak to banking organizations as part of her efforts to raise money for special needs children at her daughter’s orphanage in Hunan China.

Early life[edit]
Bair is a native of Independence, Kansas. Her father, Albert, was a surgeon. Her mother, Clara, was a nurse and housewife. She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.
Career[edit]
Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy. Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

Early life[edit]
Bair is a native of Independence, Kansas. Her father, Albert, was a surgeon. Her mother, Clara, was a nurse and housewife. She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.
Career[edit]
Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy. Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

Early life[edit]
Bair is a native of Independence, Kansas. Her father, Albert, was a surgeon. Her mother, Clara, was a nurse and housewife. She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.
Career[edit]
Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy. Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

Sheila Colleen Bair, the Chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).She was appointed to the post for a five-year term on June 26, 2006 by George W. Bush. Bair will also serve as a member of the FDIC Board of Directors through July 2013. Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy.

Sheila Bair, the Chairman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told NDTV in an exclusive interview that the US financial sector and the US economy is starting to strengthen. Ms. Bair expects the US economy to grow by 3% this year although fears that growth will remain sluggish and uneven for some time to come.  She also says that proposals to impose a tax on large banks would help build a reserve for the future, which will prevent taxpayers from shouldering the burden of failed financial Institutions as they have had to do in the past. Sheila Bair also complimented the Indian financial sector saying that strong regulation and supervision had prevented Indian banks from facing the kind of concerns that global banks had faced.

In an exclusive interview with Ira of NDTV, Sheila Bair, Chairman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, says “the US financial sector and the US economy is starting to strengthen.”

I am sure you have been thrown a number of questions on how things stand back home in the U.S, specially in terms of financial sector, Let me get your assessment firstly on the health of the financial sector as it stands now every now and then we still keep reading about the regional banks failing that number is growing how sort of obviously improve our conditions in the financial sectors 
They have improved significantly actually banks had a pretty good first quarter in US,19 billion in net earnings most of the banks were profitable, year in year earning, the delinquencies of the commercial state allowance which are driving a lot of losses or have been declining increases for several quarters, so the poor development construction allowance which has also significant loss those balances are coming down, so there is a lot of positive information coming out of the banking sector so we think banks will continue to fill in the elevated bases share but we think we will repeat the share, next share will be significantly lower level. The banks that are filling this share are lower banks and we are bidding better on the banks, we market them and sell them off to help the institution, so the bidding has been good. The pricing has started to improve, so we think lot of positive things about the banking sector that we think to improve with the recovery.

Off bad loans you are saying, the pace has come off considerably?
Yes we can say considerably, but the construction development allowance which has been the big driver for the losses for smaller banks, so the balances are coming down, lot of them have been charged up but the new norms are now been made, so that’s a good thing on the plus side I think smaller banks continue to land and that’s good smaller banks in U.S. We do want them to land, we do want them to make healthy allowance to credit with the we do want the credit intermediation to continue. Throughout the crisis the smaller banks have continued their jobs, kept maintaining their balances in the larger institutions, so in the larger institutions there has been some improvement in the quarter too.

So the credit flow has picked up to consumers, to smaller intermediate enterprises in particular, so the sense of risk aversion through the banking sector across the globe, that’s starting to ease you?
Seems, I think these banks have become a more comfortable about the economic recovery, they will be more willing to land, and they also are preparing their balance sheets, lot of banks, big banks recapitalize last year to a large degree and the smaller institutions are able to recapitalize as well which is a good thing so again a lot of positive indicators, they are some uncertainties still ahead but our economist think that the recovery will continue, they are estimating about 3% growth in GDP this year. As Ben Bernanke has said that there will be sluggish and uneven recovery but recovery will be there.

But let’s say we are going back. The fear after the euro zone debt crisis picked up, you know people started talking about the liquidity concerns, banks started to hold on to cash once again, those were a little over done as the things stand right now?
Yes In the US I think that we were not seeing that, so I think obviously that’s a situation where we continue to monitor but i think Europeans have come with a stability package so some countries in Europe have more short term fiscal issues than others, but let’s be honest that all advance countries have their balance sheets to drive stability measures for financial system to avoid prolonged deeper world wise recession, so over the long term most of the countries will be dealing with fiscal repair and austerity measures over a period of time but in the near term we thinks there are few countries.

In terms of the exposure, direct exposure that the US banks may have to debt the sovereign debt of these countries you are?
The direct exposure to the sovereign debt of the countries that have been scrutiny, this is not significant for the US banks

Ma'am just to shift focus to the reform agenda, you know now I think the things are settling down, the question is how you prevent something like this from happening again there are a number of pieces of legislation in US that’s been talked about, financial sector reform, could you give an overview of some of the contours of basic financial sector reforms that you would like to see in places as you move forward?
Well I think we are very pleased with the reforms moving forward through the US congress right now I think they will be completed before the July recess, that’s the prediction. We think resolution authority is very Important to make sure that the regulators have the tools to deal with large financial institutions that get themselves into trouble, bankruptcy there is some good work for large financial intermediaries, this is why we have always had special resolution for banks, but the problem is, most of the judicial banking sector so we didn’t really have tools to resolve very large so will have these tools moving forth. We think its essential to send the signal to the market that the shareholders and creditors of this large system, don’t get into trebled again, the shareholders and the creditors will take the losses, there will be an orderly resolution process but it will be broken up and sold off. 

Any losses will be absorbed by the markets and not the tax payers so that’s what there is in this meeting and that’s very important. New consumer protection agency we think is essential for the bank and non bank sector particularly the non bank sector. The mortgage generator in the non bank sector are pretty much unregulated leading up to this crisis, so having consumer standards across banks and non banks sector more robust. I think this bill will have enhanced derivatives over side and then the new system will provide better coordination across the system and dealing with systemic risk as well as the ability to deal with designated institutions that our systemic and this should be high supervision by the fed regardless of whether they want to become make hold companies or not they systemic implications they need to have supervision by the federation and they need be to be very helpful to us going forward.

Just to pick one aspect the start I guess the entire universal banking model which lead to these entities which are now been considered too big to fail. We've been grappling with it in herein India as well, future to that model, it’s better to break it up?
I think these Institutions need to see another on to field and if they can only survive in the market if an employed government backs up then they shouldn't be allowed to survive in the market without implied government support, and this is why we think Resolution 30 is important. You need to understand that if you invest in these big companies or you invest in their stock, you need to know that your money is at risk and you should ask them what they are doing with your money and whether they have proper risk management and what kind of risks are they taking because you are not going to get government help and you are not getting any help if they get themselves into trouble, so we think that this is an Important signal to send to the market and that with the new Resolution Regime. 

The cost of capital for these big institutions will go up and there will be market pressures on them to downsize. Another feature of this Bill is that these big entities need to fill a liquidation plans with U.S in February  and if we feel that they do have the ability to show how they can be broken up and sold off, they get themselves into trouble and there are authorities that’s again an important tool. I think its not sized that much, its interconnected, show how transparent they are managed. If they are not managed well they will be forced to downsize and the market we think will provide that discipline.

The other issue which was very much in debate is the entire bank tax issue. There are western nations which are in favor of it at the G20, other countries like India clearly opposed it. What are the pros and cons. and is it only going to work if it’s a global agreement, rather than just one or 2 countries?
I don’t think that there needs to be a global agreement. I think that there are 2 kinds of proposals out there right now. One is for a bag tax, which would be a tax and go into general revenue and that’s been proposed in the US as a general means of paying the govt back what the govt feels is the projected losses from the entire program. We aren’t really weighing into that it’s a tax issue not a bank regulation issue. 

There is also a proposal which we do strongly support to have large financial institutions pay into a pre funded reserve to provide the FDIC with working capital. To resolve one of these large systemic entities if they get into trouble. It would only be for working capital. so the whole idea of the resolution authority is to provide some bridge funding to keep the entity operational it should break it up and is sold off.. as the assets are sold off the govt will recoup its money, but nonetheless there is a short term need for working capital to keep the entity operational.. so we think they should be funded in advance by the financial institutions themselves.. that is the approach that the house bill takes. 

The senate bill sets up a line of credit which we would borrow from to resolve the entity and then the line of credit will be paid once the assets are sold. Either model is workable. I am the kind of person that likes to be paid upfront as opposed to borrowing and then repaying and you would still need a line of credit I think for potential unforeseen needs. But we do think it is better to fund the pre funded reserve if possible. This is for our deposit insurance fund. It is a prefunded reserve, it’s not a slush fund it’s not a bailout fund it’s there for specific purpose to protect insurance depositors. Just as this fund would be for a specific purpose to provide working capital to large financial institutions and resolutions. So I think we have a very good track record on that so I don’t think that people will be worried about it being misused. We are very religious about protecting these funds and using them only for intended purposes. But I don’t know how that debate is going to resolve itself in the US…. so as I said it’s like competing proposals now so we'll see what the conference tells us.

What’s the reluctance from the international front? From what I have read there are a couple of issues. One, they said that if you don’t have it in all geographies, you'll see a tendency of banks to move operations to geographies where there isn’t a tax. The second argument is that what you do with international banks which have limited operations in the US. How would those kinds of issues get resolved?
I don’t think the size of the fund is such that .. you are probably talking about 10-15bn from the entire industry to build the fund up over time….so that’s not an insignificant amount of money. But it’s not a huge amount given the size of the financial services industry in the US. So I'd be surprised if it had any kind of significant competitive impact. Perhaps those concerns are overblown, if you're talking about like a transaction tax or something like that.. a true tax that goes into general revenues.. perhaps global coordination is more important.. I can see that would generate more revenues. It could resolve a competitive differential. But what we are talking about and what the European Union is talking about is more of a pre funded reserve for institutions. The dollar amounts that we are talking about are again built up over time. It would surprise me if they would create any real competitive issues. 

Then of course there is the whole co rule which is the hot topic of debate. You are into reducing risks in terms of derivatives etc. Where do things stand on that? What are the pros and cons? And does it hamper in some way the growth of the financial systems especially these large financial entities. If you do have such stringent rules being put into place, surely there are arguments on both sides?
So I think we are supportive…I think at least for the insured bag.. it’s just simply not appropriate, it’s supposed not to be allowed now. And that we would carry that a step forward and push it out completely even with a bank holding co. So I think we are supportive of that. And I think some form of that will be part of the final bill. There is a separate issue about derivatives pushing derivative activity out of banks. And there have been proposals to push those out completely. Though now I think they are talking about requiring certain types of derivatives activities to be in an affiliated bank. And only certain others can be inside the bank. I think there you need to differentiate between the types of derivatives. I think the CDs market has been highly problematic. I have a lot of concerns especially speculative CDs activity that’s not tied to a legitimate hedging need. Pushing that off the planet would be fine with me. But there are different types of derivatives and different functions.. and most of what banks do inside banks is interest rates risk derivatives and currency derivatives. And by and large there have not been significant problems. I think you make a loan to a customer.. the customer has needs to hedge the interest rate risk. and so this is tied to the business of banking. So I don’t think it is inappropriate for that to be done and inside banks. It’s been done for a long time. We need to think hard about what the purpose is of pushing that outside of the banks. Also if it stays within a bank holding company which are better regulated, but still there are uneven capital requirements between affiliated banks and the banks themselves. But something else I think. Congress needs to think about is when you are pushing out activity, where are you pushing it? Is the regulation good? Is there transparency? So we hope the Congress thinks through those types of issues. But the good news is that we all agree that for the standardized derivative product need to be moved on to central clearing parties. That will definitely be part of the final packages. It will be very helpful in getting the risk out of the system. 

On a more global level.. the debate about capital requirements.. liquidity requirements, whether you do it under Basel Accord or not.. how is that shaping up? Because the argument could again be made that if you impose very stringent or capital requirements right now, you could hurt growth even further, so right now the timing of it and even the need to ease capital and liquidity requirements?
Bad times we can’t do it, good times we can’t do it…..we need to do it, there needs to be some time for transition period obviously, but the capital base of the banking system and the non banking financial system needs to be strengthened. Especially the non-banking system. There is too much leverage going into this and so we need better quality capital. We need more capital and at the end of the day, a well capitalized financial system will be a capital system that is in a much better position to provide sustainable credit to the economy without getting itself into trouble…. without precipitating the kind of crisis we saw. Leverage was at the heart of that crisis and we need to get those capital requirements up. It needs to happen again. There needs to be a transition period. 

Any impressions within that context that you have picked up on the Indian baking system.. because our regulation and supervision has been pretty strong… whether it’s through capital requirements, reserve requirements.  Also through prudential measures which we have quite actively undertaken in the financial sector.. any impressions that you have picked up on that model?
I think that is true and India is in a very good position to learn from our mistakes. The good news is that banks in India did not have these complex derivatives... CDs or CDRs .. any of the bad things that caused so many of the losses as we get into the crisis….and we have very strong liquidity requirements… and good capital basis. So these are good things to build from….so this is the advantage that India has.

Your thoughts on what the key risks are. Whether it is the financial sector in particular or the global economy.. as things stand right now, what are the fault lines that you will be looking at?
Well I think it is all about the economy right now. So we get feeling good about the economy, it’s something that we continue to monitor. and I do think that to get more support there needs to be more strategy and withdrawal of all the government support. It’s probably not a good idea to do this in stages. So it’s really about the economy at this point. The insurance banks raised a lot of capital ensuring that the capital bases have been strengthened greatly. The smaller banks are also being able to raise capital now as the economy improves. So overall the insurance banking system seems to be in a pretty good shape right now...but again...it’s all about the economy.

          Sheila Bair
        

President of Washington College


  Sheila C. Bair, the former chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and a renowned advocate for financial reform, was named the president of Washington College in May of 2015 and took office on August 1.   


  “I am incredibly pleased to be joining Washington College, a school the father of our country helped found over two centuries ago. This is a pivotal moment in its rich history,” Bair said at the time her appointment was announced. “As some see challenges in liberal arts education, Washington College sees nothing but opportunities. Through multi-disciplinary programs and experiential learning, Washington College gives its students the knowledge and practical skills to succeed as model, global citizens. 


  “If the financial crisis taught us anything, it is that we need decision-makers in both the public and private sectors who understand the social, ethical, and economic consequences of their actions – who can appreciate the historical and cultural context of the global environment in which we live, and who will be committed to the health and prosperity of not only their generation, but of generations to come,” she added.  “That is the kind of education that Washington College has been providing to generations of students.” 


  “I am also pleased to be joining the Chestertown community and look forward to building even stronger ties between the college and local residents. Given its location on the Chester River near the Chesapeake Bay, Washington College is well-positioned to expand its well-regarded environmental research while contributing to the quality of life in Kent County.” 


  In announcing the appointment of Bair as the College’s 28th president, and the first female president in its 232-year history, H. Lawrence Culp, Jr., then chair-elect of the Washington College Board of Visitors and Governors, said she had proven herself on the world stage “as a clear-eyed strategic thinker who is willing to challenge the status quo to improve institutions and improve lives. She understands our history, our mission, our values, and our potential. She also appreciates this beautiful Chesapeake Bay region and understands the importance of Chestertown and the College collaborating in ways that benefit our students and the community,” continued Culp, a 1985 graduate of Washington College who recently retired as president and CEO of Danaher Corporation. 


  Appointed to lead the FDIC by President George W. Bush in 2006, Bair led the Commission skillfully during one of our nation’s most challenging periods. She was one of the first officials to warn about the damage the growing subprime mortgage crisis would pose to millions of homeowners and the economy at large. Consumer advocates praised her relentless efforts to represent the interests of homeowners, bank customers and taxpayers. She helped shape and implement the Dodd-Frank Act, which gave the FDIC expanded power to “wind down” rather than bail out a failing bank, and created the Advisory Committee on Economic Inclusion in an effort to bring banking services to underserved populations. 


  As head of the FDIC, Bair was recognized for sound fiscal management and for raising employee morale. Under her leadership, the agency rose from last to first ranking in “Best Places to Work in the Federal Government” from the Partnership for Public Service. In 2011, she was named by the Washington Post and Harvard University as one of America’s seven top leaders.


  Her tenacity, independence and leadership earned a John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award, the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award, and the Better Business Bureau’s Presidents’ Award. Forbes magazine twice named her the second most powerful woman in the world, behind Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel. 


  Bair chronicled her five years at the FDIC in Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself, a New York Times bestseller published in September 2012. A prolific writer, she is a regular contributor to Fortune and has written three books for children that offer lessons in financial literacy.   


  After stepping down from the FDIC at the end of her term in 2011, Bair served as a senior advisor to the Pew Charitable Trusts and chaired the Systemic Risk Council, a public-interest group of prominent former government officials and financial experts who monitor the implementation of financial reforms. She also served on the board of the nonprofit Volcker Alliance, which was formed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to promote more effective government. 


  A native of the small town of Independence, Kansas, where her father was a surgeon and her mother a nurse, Bair earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy at the University of Kansas in 1974 and a law degree from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. She began her career in public service as an aide to Kansas senator Bob Dole and later served as a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a senior vice president for government relations at the New York Stock Exchange, and Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury. For four years prior to joining the FDIC, she was the Dean’s Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. 


  Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper, Vice President of Government Relations at the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the couple has two children, Preston and Colleen.

                           worldwide
                           Sheila Bair is widely acknowledged in government circles and the media as one of the first people to identify and accurately
                              assess the subprime crisis. Appointed by George W. Bush as the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
                              in 2006, she witnessed the origins of the financial crisis and in 2008 became-along with Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Timothy
                              Geithner-one of the key players invested in repairing the damage to our economy. Bull by the Horns is her remarkable and refreshingly
                              honest account of that contentious time and the struggle for reform that followed and continues to this day. A levelheaded,
                              pragmatic figure with a clear focus on serving the public good, Bair was often one of the few women in the room during heated
                              discussions about the economy. Despite her years of experience and her determination to rein in the private banks and Wall
                              Street, she frequently found herself at odds with Geithner. She is withering in her assessment of some of Wall Street's finest,
                              and her narrative of Citibank's attempted takeover of Wachovia is a stinging indictment of how regulators and the banks worked
                              against the public interest at times to serve their own needs. Bair is steadfast in her belief that the American public needs
                              to fully understand the crisis in order to bring it to an end. Critical of the bank bailouts and the Can. $29.99 lax regulation
                              that led to the economic crash, she provides a sober analysis as well as a practical plan for how we should move forward.
                              She helps clear away the myths and half-truths about how we ran our economic engine into the ditch and tells us how we can
                              help get our financial and regulatory systems back on track

                              What does it mean to be an American? What are American ideas and values? American Enterprise, the companion book to a major
                                 exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, aims to answer these questions about the American experience
                                 through an exploration of its economic and commercial history. It argues that by looking at the intersection of capitalism
                                 and democracy, we can see where we as a nation have come from and where we might be going in the future. Richly illustrated
                                 with images of objects from the museum's collections, American Enterprise includes an early Thomas Edison light bulb, a wheat
                                 thresher, a Barbie doll, a Google server, and many other goods and services that have shaped American culture. Historical
                                 and contemporary advertisements are also featured, emphasizing the evolution of the relationship between producers and consumers
                                 over time. Interspersed in the historical narrative are essays from today's industry leaders--including Sheila Bair, Adam
                                 Davidson, Bill Ford, Sally Greenberg, Fisk Johnson, Hank Paulson, Richard Trumka, and Pat Woertz--that pose provocative questions
                                 about the state of contemporary American business and society. American Enterprise is a multi-faceted survey of the nation's
                                 business heritage and corresponding social effects that is fundamental to an understanding of the lives of the American people,
                                 the history of the United States, and the nation's role in global affairs"

                                 has become standard operating procedure for big debtor nations. They prop up failing institutions, print money, and avoid

                                 economic recovery and what needs to be done in order to restore stability. Along the way, Onaran takes an honest look at how
                                 we arrived at this point and details the harsh realities that must be faced, and the serious steps that must be taken, in

Early life[edit]
Bair is a native of Independence, Kansas. Her father, Albert, was a surgeon. Her mother, Clara, was a nurse and housewife. She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.
Career[edit]
Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy. Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

Early life[edit]
Bair is a native of Independence, Kansas. Her father, Albert, was a surgeon. Her mother, Clara, was a nurse and housewife. She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.

Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002.

She received her bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Kansas in 1975,[5] and worked as a bank teller for a brief period, before receiving a J.D. from the University of Kansas School of Law in 1978. In 1981, she was recruited by Senator Bob Dole, a Republican from her state, to serve as counsel on his staff in Washington.
Career[edit]
Prior to her appointment at the FDIC, Bair was the Dean's Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, a post she had held since 2002. She also served as Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the U.S. Department of the Treasury (2001 to 2002), Senior Vice President for Government Relations of the New York Stock Exchange (1995 to 2000), a Commissioner and Acting Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (1991 to 1995), and Research Director, Deputy Counsel and Counsel to Kansas Republican Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (1981 to 1988). While an academic, Bair also served on the FDIC's Advisory Committee on Banking Policy. Bair also pursued a seat in the U.S. Congress (she lost the 1990 Republican nomination in the 5th Kansas district by 760 votes to Dick Nichols).[6] Bair began her career in the General Counsel's office of the former U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.[7]
Bair left the FDIC on July 8, 2011, when her five-year term expired.[8][9] She became a senior advisor to The Pew Charitable Trusts in August 2011.[10] She is chair of the Systemic Risk Council, a volunteer effort formed by the CFA Institute and the Pew Charitable Trusts to monitor and comment on regulation.[11] Bull by the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself was published Sept. 25, 2012. Bair has also written two books for children that encourage savings: Rock, Brock and the Savings Shock (2006) and Isabel's Car Wash (2008). Bair joined the board of Banco Santander in January 2014, even though she has been a critic of revolving door.[12]
Bair is married to Scott P. Cooper and has two children, Preston and Colleen.
2008 financial crisis[edit]
Bair assumed a prominent role in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, including bolstering public confidence and system stability that resulted in no runs on bank deposits. The FDIC did not turn to taxpayer borrowing to manage its losses and liquidity needs, instead funding them through its traditional means of assessing banks for the cost of insuring their deposits. The FDIC's resolution practice of selling failing banks to healthier institutions, while providing credit support of future losses from failed banks' troubled loans, saved the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund $40 billion over losses it would have incurred if the FDIC had liquidated those banks.[citation needed]
During the congressional effort to reform the financial regulatory system, Bair successfully pushed to establish tools to end the doctrine of "too big to fail" by extending the FDIC's resolution process to large, systemically-important financial institutions. The FDIC was also given joint authority to order the restructuring of an entity that cannot demonstrate, through a continually-monitored "living will," that it can be unwound.[citation needed]
Bair is active on the international front, and pressed the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to adopt strong capital and leverage standards.[13]
In a fictional TV movie about the crises, Patricia Randell played Bair in the 2011 HBO movie Too Big to Fail, based on the popular book of the same name by New York Times journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin.
Reputation[edit]
In 2009, Bair was named one of Time magazine's "Time 100" most influential people. In 2008, Bair topped The Wall Street Journal's annual 50 "Women to Watch List." In 2008 and 2009, Forbes ranked her as the second most powerful woman in the world behind German chancellor Angela Merkel. Forbes described her FDIC office as "the last stop for capital-starved banks (and their insured customers) before going under."[14]
Awards[edit]
Bair has received many awards, including the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award and Hubert H. Humphrey Civil Rights Award.[15]
In 2009, Bair was presented the Consumer Federation of America's Philip Hart Public Service Award.[16]
On March 29, 2012 Bair was honored by the Romney Institute of Public Management (BYU Marriott School of Management) as the Administrator of the Year.[17][18]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
