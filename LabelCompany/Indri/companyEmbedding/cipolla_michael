About Us

Cowboy Canyon Winery, owned and operated by Donna and Michael Cipolla with close friends Chad and Linda Kearns. We contract for the finest fruit form California and sometimes beyond. We produce very small batches (+/- 100 cases) of each varietal allowing us to give the grapes the attention and the love they deserve so they return that love with great wine.  


How We Got Started

When best friends Chad & Linda Kearns owners of Giracci Vineyards & Farms made Michael & Donna Cipolla an offer to Pardner-up, they just couldn't refuse. Chad & Linda Kearns have owned Giracci Vineyards & Farms since 2008. Michael & Donna Cipolla have been making award winning wines for 30+ years.
