Volatility is normal; it is the price you pay for the higher returns you earn in the stock market.
Peter Tanous


Private Clients
While individual circumstances vary, our clients are primarily concerned with maintaining and growing the purchasing power of their capital.  We typically manage several accounts for each client, including registered and non-registered accounts which allows us to manage an individual’s total portfolio in the most tax effective manner possible.
Our private client mandates include managing portfolios for individuals, families, foundations and businesses. We work closely with our clients to determine objectives, risk tolerance and review any considerations that are relevant to the portfolio management process. Portfolios are managed on a discretionary basis, but we are in regular contact with clients to ensure the asset mix and specific holdings remain appropriate.
Those interested in learning more about our investment process and philosphy are encouraged to review the Investor Education section of this website or to contact Brian Alexander at balexander@cypresscap.com.

Institutional Clients
At Cypress we have extensive experience managing Canadian institutional equity mandates including: General Canadian Equity, Small-Cap, Real-Estate, High-Yield, Income and Oil & Gas. We are proud of our performance and are happy to discuss specifics with those institutions looking for an experienced Canadian equity manager with a proven track record. Please contact Michael Fricker mfricker@cypresscap.com should you need further information.

Buying and selling stocks may be fun. But if your goal is profit not pleasure, a little indolence is useful. Stock trading is a very expensive form of entertainment.
Jonathan Clements


Overview
At Cypress we believe that one of the most important (if not the most important) aspects of our job as portfolio managers is to educate prospective and existing clients on investing. We strive to give our clients a firm understanding of the fundamentals of how capital markets work and to ensure they appreciate the difference between ‘investing’ and ‘trading’. We want our clients to realise that the financial services industry is often motivated to sell products that are not necessarily in the client’s best interest. Our experience has shown us that financially well-informed clients have a much better understanding and appreciation of the markets and the securities they own and are ultimately in a stronger position to make the right long-term investment decisions.
10 Biggest Mistakes Made by Investors
Time and again we see investors make mistakes that are often ruinous to their financial health. Below we have listed our “Top-10 Biggest Mistakes Made by Investors”

Confusing volatility with risk. Volatility is the hourly, daily, monthly and yearly gyrations in the market. Risk is the permanent loss of purchasing power. The two are very different and should not be confused. Volatility is primarily a risk in the short-term, but actually creates opportunities for investors with long-term time horizons.
Seeking income rather than total return. Too much focus on income can lead to investors chasing yield and neglecting to evaluate the underlying fundamentals of a given security. The debacle in sub-prime mortgages in 2006-2008 is an extreme example of this phenomenon. A properly constructed portfolio will have balance of income, value, and growth.
Letting emotions override rational decisions. We cannot overstate the importance of this issue. The stock market is inherently a volatile place and investors must learn not to let emotions overcome rational investing decisions. Numerous studies, including Dalbar’s influential ‘Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behaviour’,  have shown that the biggest mistakes investors make are rooted in emotions.
Emphasising short-term performance. Material investment returns are accumulated and compounded over time, making short-term performance all but irrelevant. Portfolios should be re-evaluated on a systematic basis or when investor circumstances change; they should not be re-evaluated based on the latest fluctuations in the market or in reaction to a news headline.
Neglecting to diversify portfolios properly. Proper diversification is critical to ensuring that investors earn an appropriate return over the medium and long-term.
Paying too much attention to short-term market fluctuations. The day-to-day movements in the markets are simply noise and distract investors from the important decisions such as asset allocation, diversification and protecting the purchasing power of their assets.
Believing that active trading adds value. Research has shown that the cost and taxes associated with active trading have a material negative impact on returns – so not only does active trading not add value it subtracts value.
Believing that government fixed-income securities are ‘risk-free’. Inflation and rising interest rates can have a material impact on government fixed-income returns, so while the interest payments and return of principal may be ‘guaranteed’ the preservation of the investor’s purchasing power is not. We see our job as portfolio managers as primarily one of maintaining and growing the purchasing power of invested capital.
Believing that big companies are ‘safe’ and small companies are ‘risky’. Recent history has seen some of the largest companies in the world either go bankrupt or reduced significantly in size. Business fundamentals such as competitive positioning, industry dynamics and balance sheet strength are important regardless of the size of the company.
Confusing the short-term day-to-day ‘entertainment’ of the markets with long-term ‘investing’. Proper investing is a rational and methodical exercise. The daily gyrations of the market are simply ‘noise’ that may be interesting or entertaining, but adds little to the process of constructing an appropriate investment portfolio.


Questions to Ask a Prospective Investment Advisor
An educated investor should know what questions to ask their investment advisor either during initial discussions or during their regular portfolio review sessions. Below we have set out some questions that we believe investors should ask their investment advisors and that advisors should be in a position to answer.

How does the asset mix in the portfolio match with the Investment Policy Statement? Should there be any changes in the Investment Policy Statement? A portfolio should be set up according to an investor’s individual circumstances. Investment Policy Statements should take into account cash needs, risk tolerance and any other relevant factors.
How much risk was taken to earn the return? When performance numbers are evaluated it is important to consider the risk associated with those returns. Higher returns are of course desirable, but not if they mean too much risk.
What is it costing me to have the portfolio managed? This is crucial. Fees in investment management are often opaque and wrapped up in management expense ratios, load-fees, and commissions. Any good investment advisor should be transparent and forthcoming with what fees are being charged to the account.
How much trading has taken place? A competent advisor should be able to explain why any trading has taken place within the portfolio. Excessive trading or ‘churning’ portfolios is a recipe for high commission, high taxes and low returns.
How do you expect to add value in markets which are very ‘efficient’? The ‘efficiency’ of the market in assigning value to securities is a matter of debate, especially at the macro level. What is beyond debate is that outperforming the ‘market’ is extremely difficult, especially in the medium to long-term. Adding value requires experience and a disciplined approach. We would advise investors to be skeptical of any advisor or manager who believes it is easy to consistently beat the market.
