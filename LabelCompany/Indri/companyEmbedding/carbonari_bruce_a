"He then went on to lead the final development and implementation of the plan to separate Fortune Brands' businesses, which will result in two strong, independent companies with outstanding future prospects."Carbonari, who has been with Fortune for 21 years, has served as chairman and CEO since 2008. He became president and chief operating officer in 2006. He oversaw Moen in the 1990s, and what is now the home and security business in the early 2000s as its sales more than doubled.

Each board will add one or more members following the split.The Beam board will be made up of: Mackay, Richard Goldstein, former CEO, International Flavors and Fragrances Inc.; Ann Fritz Hackett, president, Horizon Consulting Group; Pierre Leroy, former president, Worldwide Construction & Forestry Division and Global Parts Division, Deere & Co.; Beam CEO Shattock, Anne Tatlock, former CEO, Fiduciary Trust Co. International; and Peter Wilson, former chairman, Gallagher Group.Fortune Brands' board will be made up of: Thomas, Goldstein, Fritz Hackett, Fortune CEO Klein, Mackay, Ron Waters, former president CEO, LoJack Corp.; and Norm Wesley, former chairman & CEO, Fortune Brands."These boards are composed of directors with deep and relevant experience, commitment to strong corporate governance, and a track record of promoting the interests of shareholders," Carbonari said in a statement.As part of the separation plan, the company expects to complete the sale of its golf business to a group led by Fila Korea and Mirae Asset Private Equity by the end of this month.
