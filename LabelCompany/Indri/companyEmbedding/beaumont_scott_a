How does FOX contribute to your success?
				I have the best 4X fork on the market - the Factory Series 32 831 100 FIT RLC. It is great that FOX invested time and money into developing a specific fork for 4X. It makes a huge difference being able to tune it in with Fitzy and Justin at the World Cups.
What else is in your garage?
				Intense Podium BMX, golf clubs, gym, and trophies!
What's your training regimen?
				About 3-4 hours a day. Loads of gym work at the moment. Also, sprints on the bike, XC riding, DH riding, but most of all riding the 4X bike at 4X tracks. Loads of gate starts.
Any major injuries, and how did you recover?
				A few here and there but for the most part I have been lucky. Last year I tore all the ligaments in my left foot at the second World Cup in Maribor, Slovenia. I tried to carry on racing in the weeks afterwards with a shoe two sizes bigger on my left foot, but in the end I had to stop racing, recover and come back at the end of the season. The recovery was cool as I worked with a premiership football phisio. Learnt a few new things with him!
What's your typical pre-race/event meal? Guilty pleasure?
				Pre-race meal is pasta. It's pretty easy to eat and fuels me up. Guilty pleasure would be vanilla ice cream.
How do you determine which races or events to enter each year?
				I always have a set program of 4X races - 6 British 4X Nationals, 5 Euro 4X rounds and 6 World Cups. Plus the big one day events - National Championships, European Championships and World Championships. Then we add in other festival events if they work with the schedule.
What motivated you to get started professionally?
				My dad was a professional motorcycle racer. Racing is really in my family so it was always going to happen. My mom used to race motorcycles and my uncle still runs one of the biggest motorsport associations in the UK, so I wanted to race something! I started out in BMX and moved to MTB in 1996.
What separates you from other professional athletes?
				Not much separates any of us to be honest. Usually just 1 percent mentally on race day makes the difference!
What would you be doing if you weren't a professional athlete?
				Jet pilot! It was always my 'real job' dream at school! Although I raced my first BMX European Championship when I was just 5 years old, so the pro athlete route was always inevitable!
What's the best thing about being a professional athlete?				Travelling around the world and seeing so many sights that I may not have seen otherwise. Also, pushing myself in my training and not being restricted with time in my training sessions. Being able to ride anytime is the biggest bonus.
What other sports are you interested in?
				Moto X! I love Supercross and Moto X. I also like Moto GP, Formula 1, World Rally, Speedway, golf, BMX. If it's a race then I'm interested!
Any advice to the readers dreaming to turn pro?
				If you are not training, then someone else is! To become a pro takes a lot of dedication and hard work. It is worth it in so many ways, but you might have to pass on a few of those nights out with your buddies to make it all the way!
What are your favorite magazines and websites?
				Favorite magazines are MBUK, Dirt, GQ, Moto, Racer X, Decline. Favorite websites are Dirt, Silverfish, Bikeradar, Southerndownhill, and Racer X.
Favorite movie quote?
				"I don't care if he's Muhammed, I'm hard, Bruce Lee" - Snatch, 2000
Who is your hero?
				Ricky Carmichael. That guy is such a legend I cannot even start to describe him. Flat out, ballsiest MX rider ever.
Are you a Mac or PC? PC - just about to eject from that sinking ship and become Mac
Top 3 bands Black Eyed Peas, Daft Punk, and The XX
Greatest strength Being smooth
Most frustrating challenge Making the perfect gate start

My name is Scott Beaumont and I am a professional Mountain Bike rider specialising in a discipline called 4X. Born in 1978, I started out racing BMX at the age of 4. I continued racing BMX until the age of 18. In this time I was very successful, winning the British Championship 16 times and I was able to crown my BMX career with the World Championship title in 1995 and 1996.
After winning my second World Championship title, I was approached by a Mountain Bike company and offered a salary to compete in Downhill and 4X disciplines. From then I have not looked back, competing on the World circuit for over 20 years now. I have been able to win the National Championship 6 times and the British Series 9 times. Currently I am ranked number 2 in the World and my aims for 2016 is to become the first male rider to win World Championships on both BMX and Mountain Bike. With USN in my corner, I am confident we have everything in place.

4X ProTour 2017 – Round 3: Fort William, Scotland

			Posted on June 8, 2017 by boomboom 


Last weekend, Scott had one of his most important races on the 2017 calendar. The 4X ProTour round in Fort William, Scotland. Held as part of the Fort William Downhill World Cup weekend, this event attracts thousands of fans who flock to the Scottish Highlands to watch 4X ProTour, Downhill World Cup and the impressive side events.

The race had a good entry, so when practice started the track had a constant flow of riders as everyone got to grips with it. The weather was wet, but in many ways, that helped the new track changes to bind together. The new changes were good as they added 2 extra turns to the track which would really help passing opportunities come race time.
Scott has had some great results here in the past and always rides his track well so we were confident heading into qualifying.
With all the top riders injury free, this year’s 4X ProTour looked set to be one of the best ever. With 10 of the elite men riders all more than capable of taking wins and the overall title, the strength in depth of 4X ProTour is now better than ever. Scott knows that consistency will be the key and was looking for a decent qualifying to set up his race night.
Qualifying:
In his qualifying run, visually, Scott looked one of the quickest on course and as he crossed – until the last turn where Scott ran off line and almost crashed. Having to roll through the final jump, Scott lost a lot of time, but still managed to cross the finish in 5th. Clearly gutted, Scott knew he was on a flier and it was time to plan racing on Saturday night. After the run Scott said:
“I made a great start and rode all the lines well. I really messed up in the final turn and that cost me today but we will be back tomorrow”.

 
Race Day:
Race day rolled around and the weather took a turn before practice started. A huge downpour made the track tricky initially, but as racing rolled around, the rain stopped and the track surprisingly was perfect. With huge crowds, Scott was ready. Winning his first 2 rounds of racing Scott was looking good. In his quarter final Scott made a great gate and led the race into turn 1. Ahead of Joost Wichman, Scott looked comfortable as he booked his place in the semi final.

Semi Final:
In the semi final, Scott opted for the slightly smoother gate 3. This race was all time! In the last 10 years of 4X racing, these 4 guys had all been instrumental in the development of the sport and world wide promotion. These guys are the jedi’s and the crowd knew it. High fiving before the start Scott lined up with Tomas Slavik, Quentin Derbier and Joost Wichman. The gate dropped and Scott got squeezed. Having to settle into 4th position in the first turn, Scott used his head and railed the turn. Carrying loads of speed on the 2nd straight, Scott was on the move. Railing turn 2, he moved into 3rd and then in the blink of an eye, he moved into 2nd. The crowd were going crazy, but on the exit of the turn Scott then got overtook again and slipped back to 3rd. Staying in touch, Scott battled but across the finish, he ended up 3rd and didn’t make the main final.

Small Final:
Scott was absolutely gutted. Making the final is extremely important to Scott at this race, but after such an incredible semi final, the only winner was the sport of 4X! One of the hardest things in 4X is to get knocked out in the semi final and then pick yourself back up to race again for 5th to 8th places.
Scott took gate 1. Nailed a perfect gate and set off chasing the win and 5th overall for the evening. Scott had to hold the inside on turn 2 to protect against a pass but Quentin Derbier used the same move as Scott made in the semi final and moved into the lead. The race stayed close but Scott crossed the line in 2nd giving him 6th for the evening.
It wasn’t Scott’s best race in Fort William, but he was very happy with the way he raced on the night:
“I am pretty disappointed with 6th but at the same time happy with how I rode. That was a race where anyone could have won but I gave it my all and 6th was the result. We have a few weeks now to prepare for the next round in Czech Republic”.

USN Racing – 4X ProTour 2017 – Winterberg, Germany Race Report

			Posted on June 1, 2017 by boomboom 


Scott Beaumont
Qualifying – 7th
Race – 17th
The second round of the 2017 4X ProTour took place in Winterberg, Germany at the weekend. After a strong start to his 2017 season, Scott Beaumont was looking to cement himself in the running for the overall title in Winterberg with a track that really played to his strengths.
Held as part of the Dirt Masters Festival, this event attracts thousands of fans who flock to Winterberg in Germany to watch 4X ProTour, IXS Downhill Cup and the impressive Slopestyle event.

The race had nearly 200 riders entered so practice was busy and the track had a constant flow of riders as everyone got to grips with it. The weather was dry for qualifying making the track super-fast and dusty. The sun was shining and the track was absolutely perfect.
Scott has had some great results here in the past and always rides his track well so we were confident heading into qualifying.
With all the top riders injury free, this year’s 4X ProTour looked set to be one of the best ever. With 10 of the elite men riders all more than capable of taking wins and the overall title, the strength in depth of 4X ProTour is now better than ever. Scott knows that consistency will be the key and was looking for a decent qualifying run to put himself in a good position for racing.
In his qualifying run, visually, Scott looked one of the quickest on course and as he crossed the finish line the time agreed placing Scott in 7th position. Disappointed with the run Scott said:
“I made a great start and rode all the lines well. I was a little conservative due to the cross wind on the table tops lower down on the track. It was a good run but to be 0.8 seconds off and all the way down in 7th is disappointing.”

Race day rolled around and Scott was ready. The Yeti race bikes were prepped and Scott rode a couple of practice laps to prepare for the racing. Winning his first round of racing Scott was looking good. In his second round Scott made his best gate of the weekend and led the race into turn 1 but disaster struck. Losing his front wheel Scott crashed out. In a quick scramble for bikes, Scott remounted and was chasing the leading two riders. The amount of ground that Scott made up was incredible and if the track had been 200m longer he may well have been able to make the comeback of the season, but he simply ran out of track. Absolutely gutted Scott finished 3rd which placed him 17th for the day.
After the race, Scott said:
“Well that was a tough day in the office. The main thing is I have no broken bones or serious injuries. Hands up that was my mistake as I pushed hard into turn one and I just lost the front wheel. Mistakes are rare in our team but today is one of those days. I have 5 days now to get ready for Fort William and round three”.
As Scott mentioned there, the teams next event is 4X ProTour round 3 in Fort William, Scotland this Saturday. In the meantime, our team diary edit will be live from Winterberg tomorrow. We will send it out to you all in the morning.

USN Racing Diaries – 4X ProTour Round 1 is Live

			Posted on April 27, 2017 by boomboom 


For 2017, the USN Racing team will be creating more diaries featuring pro rider Scott Beaumont during his races. Here is the first one from the team after round 1 of the 2017 4X ProTour which was held at Roquebrune in Southern France.
 








4X ProTour Round 1 – Roquebrune, France

			Posted on April 12, 2017 by boomboom 


Well the winter months are finally over and the 2017 season is here. Scott’s preparation has been perfect and we are now on route to round 1 of the 4X ProTour being held in Roquebrune, France.
Coming into this season as UCI World Number 1, Scott is looking for consistency to work towards the overall 4X ProTour title.
The track in France was a bitter sweet pill to swallow for Scott last year as a mistake whilst leading cost him a shot at the race win. He is looking for a solid start to his campaign this year.
With some fresh sponsors on board for the 2017 campaign the team are motivated and ready to race.
Arriving on Wednesday afternoon, we went to look at the track. Located at the heart of the new Azur Bike Park, what has been created is amazing. Built on the side of a mountain, the track winds its way through huge berms, multi lines, and some of the biggest jumps in the 4X ProTour into the finish arena. There were several changes to the track, with more width on the first two straights, fresh berms added and a new section into the tree line.

The track in Roquebrune overlooks the French Riviera coastal town of St Maxime, so as well as being an amazing track, the views are incredible. The longest track currently used on the 4X ProTour this year, at around 50 seconds this was going to be a wild race.
On Wednesday evening, we headed over to St Maxime BMX track for their club night. After a full day of driving to the South of France, a trip to one of Scott’s favorite BMX tracks to unwind was perfect. The track is amazing and together with team photographer Charles Robertson, Scott had a play on the track and we got some great shots.
Thursday was the first official day of training at the 4X track. After a track walk, it was time to get started. Working on the top half of the track initially Scott worked on set up and looked at home straight away. The track was in immaculate condition and allowed the riders to really push hard. The racing was certainly going to be quick come race time.

In the afternoon we were lucky enough to have a couple of hours where we were able to visit Monaco to have a look round. The formula 1 track was just being built with grandstands and the pit lane garages all under construction. Quite a sight!

On to Friday training and Scott focused on the bottom half of the track and his tyre choice for the weekend. Another 3 hours of track time and confidence was building nicely into the weekend. In the afternoon we visited St Tropez for a quick walk around some super yachts!

Saturday morning and it was game time. After a two hour practice session it was qualifying. In the two hours Scott simply did full runs to prepare for the one lap of qualifying. Using all the outside lines and carrying speed we were looking for a top 3 and the first points of the year.
With Scott being the UCI World number 1 4X rider, he went last. With only one rider going below 45 seconds, the job was simple. Get a 44 point something and he would be in the top two. With a perfect qualifying lap, that’s exactly what Scott did. Stopping the clock at 44.89 it was good enough for second position.

On Saturday night, the organisers hosted a BBQ for all the riders. It was great to socialise with everyone and catch up on what everyone had been doing over winter. An early night for the team to get ready for race day.
Sunday morning and there was a two hour practice session. With no track changes, Scott did a couple of practice starts then two full runs and with over an hour remaining, he decided to save his energy for the racing.
At 14.00 the racing started. Scott took the win in his first two rounds and was looking fast, backing up his qualifying ride. In the quarter final, he made a perfect start and again led the race from start to finish with no problems. Onto the semi final and this looked tougher. Scott again made a perfect start and battled bar to bar into turn one defending and holding his line to lead the race. From here Scott pulled away and took a convincing win.

Final time. Scott was in gate two. Making a good gate Scott again went bar to bar with both riders either side of him and unfortunately this time he got squeezed into turn 1. Re grouping and starting the charge from fourth, Scott rode hard all the way down the track and dived inside on the final turn but unfortunately he could not get the bike turned enough to make the pass stick.
Fourth position for Scott and some good points to start his 2017 4X ProTour campaign. Scott really felt like this was the race that got away though and is now heading home to continue his preparation for the next round at Winterberg, Germany on May 26th.

We want to thank all the team sponsors for helping us put together an amazing package that is allowing Scott to ride at his absolute maximum.

 
Until next time.
