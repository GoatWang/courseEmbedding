Wattenberg Field
(Niobrara & Codell)
North Park Basin
(Niobrara)
Mid-Continent
(Cotton Valley & Brown Dense)


Our operations are focused on the Wattenberg Field and the Cotton Valley sands of Southern Arkansas. Each well we drill in the Wattenberg is now drilled horizontally.  Every well we drill is fracture stimulated. Our strategy for creating shareholder value is primarily to grow organically by applying advanced technology to more efficiently and responsibly extract oil and natural gas resources. We also look to make strategic acquisitions in both our core areas and other oily basins in the United States where we can apply our core competencies of horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation.

About Bonanza Creek
An independent energy company producing oil and natural gas in the United States

Denver-based Bonanza Creek Energy, Inc. is an exploration and production company focused on the extraction of oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas in the United States. Founded in 1999, the company went public in December 2011. The common shares are listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbol “BCEI.”
Our operations are focused in the Wattenberg Field in the DJ Basin of Colorado and the Cotton Valley sands of southern Arkansas. The low risk, oily, and stable production profile of our Arkansas assets provides a strong cash flow base from which to develop the Niobrara and Codell formations in Colorado, the growth engine of the company. Our corporate strategy is to aggressively create shareholder value by increasing production in our current assets, while opportunistically seeking strategic acquisitions in other high return basins across the United States. Bonanza Creek maintains high working interest in its properties and operates all of its proved reserves.
Our technical staff of geologists, petroleum engineers, and geophysicists have decades of industry experience and are experts in horizontal drilling and fracture stimulation. We are dedicated throughout the organization to safety and environmental responsibility.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.75      Net Money Flow ($)  -659,386    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
