TriState Capital Bank Builds on Its Strengths


Banks have not had an easy time during the latest recession, but Pittsburgh-based TriState Capital Bank has grown and thrived since its founding in 2007. What’s TriState’s strategy for success?TriState’s first advantage was good timing, or what CEO and founder James F. Getz describes as “pure Irish luck.” The founders raised approximately $85 million in start-up funds–a record for Pennsylvania banks–before the financial crisis hit, and went into business just as other banks were seeing their balance sheets go downhill from bad mortgage assets.Second was TriState’s emphasis on experience. James F. Getz and co-founder A. William Schenck III had been working in Pittsburgh’s financial sector for decades and made a point of hiring people with 15 years of banking experience or more. This level of local and professional expertise makes for careful lending and the kind of credibility that brings in capital. In turn, a solid capital foundation allows TriState to make bigger loans than most other local banks, which has resulted in rapid growth.

James F. Getz: TriState Bank Hopes to Raise $70 million in Public Offering


James F. Getz serves as the CEO and chairman of the board for TriState Capital Bank in Pittsburgh. TriState Capital Banking is not James F. Getz’s first foray into creating a new bank. Before starting up TriState, he founded Federated Bank and Trust in 1985 and later was president at Federated Securities Corp. He also served in senior positions at two Philadelphia banks.TriState Capital Bank’s board and executive leadership plan to raise up to $70 million with its first-ever public offering of shares in the financial institution. The funds will be used not only to invest in various wealth management firms, but also to acquire some outright. The plan of TriState Capital Bank’s executive team to take the bank public has been one of their goals since the institution’s founding in 2007.

The Rise of the Boutique Bank


James F. Getz, President, Chairman, and CEO of TriState Bank, understands the advantages of the growing trend in the banking sector: boutique banks. Many traditional bankers have left large investment banks to set up their own independent advisory firms, known as boutique banks. Boutique banks have become increasingly attractive for bankers, as larger banks cut costs following declines in revenue, increased regulatory pressure, and the need to boost capital ratios. Boutique banks allow bankers to address new needs that have formed in the banking sector. Over the past 30 years, banking trends resulted in the creation of underserved sectors of the population. While traditional large banks focused on corporate and consumer markets and small local banks served consumer markets and small business loans, there was a void in institutions serving middle-market businesses and executives and individuals with high net worth. Boutique banks like TriState, led by visionary founders like James F. Getz, evolved to address this unmet need through a new business model, which melds the capabilities of a large financial institution with the personalization of a smaller bank.
