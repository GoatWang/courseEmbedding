Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Business units[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc.[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc. was formed in 2012 to design, develop, license and deploy the B&W mPower reactor, a small modular nuclear reactor. The BWXT mPower reactor – currently in development – is a scalable, modular reactor with the capacity to provide output in increments of 180 MWe for a four-year operating cycle without refueling. The business unit is headquartered in Charlotte, NC.[6]
BWXT announced in 2009 plans to design, develop, license and deploy a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) called the BWXT mPower reactor. The passively safe reactor has an output of 180 megawatts (electric) and is one of several SMRs in development by U.S. engineering firms. The mPower reactor features a full underground containment structure.[7] The reactor design is an integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) system in which the nuclear core and steam generators are contained within a single vessel.[8] B&W and engineering and construction firm Bechtel maintain an alliance called Generation mPower LLC to produce modular nuclear power plants using the BWXT mPower reactor.[9]
More than two dozen utilities belong to the Generation mPower Industry Advisory Council and provide review, insights and feedback regarding licensing and design activities for the BWXT mPower reactor. The Tennessee Valley Authority has signed a letter of intent to potentially build plants utilizing BWXT mPower reactors.[10]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc. (BWXT NE) manufactures nuclear components and provides engineering, design, construction, inspection and repair services. It was formed in 2010, named Babcock & Wilcox Nuclear Energy, by the merger of two business units, Nuclear Power Generation Group and Modular Nuclear Energy. This company was later renamed BWXT NE following the July 2015 spin-off of Babcock & Wilcox. BWXT is the only North American company to continuously manufacture nuclear steam generators for the commercial nuclear power industry since the 1950s. BWXT NE's headquarters are located in Charlotte, NC.
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc. (BWXT NOG) specializes in the design and manufacture of components for the U.S. government. BWXT NOG has four operating locations throughout the United States. BWXT NOG's Barberton, Ohio, and Mount Vernon, Indiana, locations specialize in the design and manufacture of large, heavy components. BWXT NOG facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia, and Euclid, Ohio, design and supply components for United States government programs. Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS) is a subsidiary of BWXT NOG, located in Erwin, Tennessee. BWXT NOG's headquarters are located in Lynchburg, Virginia.[11]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc. (BWXT TSG) manages complex, high-consequence nuclear and national security operations, including nuclear production facilities. BWXT TSG manages the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and provides a broad range of technical services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration's operations. Headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, BWXT TSG operates three businesses: managing and operating large manufacturing or site closure contracts for the U.S. government, facilitating laboratory services and managing technical services.[12] BWXT TSG is a member of the Los Alamos National Security, LLC and Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), the latter of which was awarded the Management & Operation (M&O) contract to operate Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, on May 8, 2007, to commence on October 1, 2007

Business units[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc.[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc. was formed in 2012 to design, develop, license and deploy the B&W mPower reactor, a small modular nuclear reactor. The BWXT mPower reactor – currently in development – is a scalable, modular reactor with the capacity to provide output in increments of 180 MWe for a four-year operating cycle without refueling. The business unit is headquartered in Charlotte, NC.[6]
BWXT announced in 2009 plans to design, develop, license and deploy a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) called the BWXT mPower reactor. The passively safe reactor has an output of 180 megawatts (electric) and is one of several SMRs in development by U.S. engineering firms. The mPower reactor features a full underground containment structure.[7] The reactor design is an integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) system in which the nuclear core and steam generators are contained within a single vessel.[8] B&W and engineering and construction firm Bechtel maintain an alliance called Generation mPower LLC to produce modular nuclear power plants using the BWXT mPower reactor.[9]
More than two dozen utilities belong to the Generation mPower Industry Advisory Council and provide review, insights and feedback regarding licensing and design activities for the BWXT mPower reactor. The Tennessee Valley Authority has signed a letter of intent to potentially build plants utilizing BWXT mPower reactors.[10]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc. (BWXT NE) manufactures nuclear components and provides engineering, design, construction, inspection and repair services. It was formed in 2010, named Babcock & Wilcox Nuclear Energy, by the merger of two business units, Nuclear Power Generation Group and Modular Nuclear Energy. This company was later renamed BWXT NE following the July 2015 spin-off of Babcock & Wilcox. BWXT is the only North American company to continuously manufacture nuclear steam generators for the commercial nuclear power industry since the 1950s. BWXT NE's headquarters are located in Charlotte, NC.
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc. (BWXT NOG) specializes in the design and manufacture of components for the U.S. government. BWXT NOG has four operating locations throughout the United States. BWXT NOG's Barberton, Ohio, and Mount Vernon, Indiana, locations specialize in the design and manufacture of large, heavy components. BWXT NOG facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia, and Euclid, Ohio, design and supply components for United States government programs. Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS) is a subsidiary of BWXT NOG, located in Erwin, Tennessee. BWXT NOG's headquarters are located in Lynchburg, Virginia.[11]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc. (BWXT TSG) manages complex, high-consequence nuclear and national security operations, including nuclear production facilities. BWXT TSG manages the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and provides a broad range of technical services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration's operations. Headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, BWXT TSG operates three businesses: managing and operating large manufacturing or site closure contracts for the U.S. government, facilitating laboratory services and managing technical services.[12] BWXT TSG is a member of the Los Alamos National Security, LLC and Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), the latter of which was awarded the Management & Operation (M&O) contract to operate Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, on May 8, 2007, to commence on October 1, 2007

Business units[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc.[edit]
BWXT mPower, Inc. was formed in 2012 to design, develop, license and deploy the B&W mPower reactor, a small modular nuclear reactor. The BWXT mPower reactor – currently in development – is a scalable, modular reactor with the capacity to provide output in increments of 180 MWe for a four-year operating cycle without refueling. The business unit is headquartered in Charlotte, NC.[6]
BWXT announced in 2009 plans to design, develop, license and deploy a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) called the BWXT mPower reactor. The passively safe reactor has an output of 180 megawatts (electric) and is one of several SMRs in development by U.S. engineering firms. The mPower reactor features a full underground containment structure.[7] The reactor design is an integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) system in which the nuclear core and steam generators are contained within a single vessel.[8] B&W and engineering and construction firm Bechtel maintain an alliance called Generation mPower LLC to produce modular nuclear power plants using the BWXT mPower reactor.[9]
More than two dozen utilities belong to the Generation mPower Industry Advisory Council and provide review, insights and feedback regarding licensing and design activities for the BWXT mPower reactor. The Tennessee Valley Authority has signed a letter of intent to potentially build plants utilizing BWXT mPower reactors.[10]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Energy, Inc. (BWXT NE) manufactures nuclear components and provides engineering, design, construction, inspection and repair services. It was formed in 2010, named Babcock & Wilcox Nuclear Energy, by the merger of two business units, Nuclear Power Generation Group and Modular Nuclear Energy. This company was later renamed BWXT NE following the July 2015 spin-off of Babcock & Wilcox. BWXT is the only North American company to continuously manufacture nuclear steam generators for the commercial nuclear power industry since the 1950s. BWXT NE's headquarters are located in Charlotte, NC.
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Nuclear Operations Group, Inc. (BWXT NOG) specializes in the design and manufacture of components for the U.S. government. BWXT NOG has four operating locations throughout the United States. BWXT NOG's Barberton, Ohio, and Mount Vernon, Indiana, locations specialize in the design and manufacture of large, heavy components. BWXT NOG facilities in Lynchburg, Virginia, and Euclid, Ohio, design and supply components for United States government programs. Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (NFS) is a subsidiary of BWXT NOG, located in Erwin, Tennessee. BWXT NOG's headquarters are located in Lynchburg, Virginia.[11]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc.[edit]
BWXT Technical Services Group, Inc. (BWXT TSG) manages complex, high-consequence nuclear and national security operations, including nuclear production facilities. BWXT TSG manages the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve and provides a broad range of technical services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration's operations. Headquartered in Lynchburg, Virginia, BWXT TSG operates three businesses: managing and operating large manufacturing or site closure contracts for the U.S. government, facilitating laboratory services and managing technical services.[12] BWXT TSG is a member of the Los Alamos National Security, LLC and Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC (LLNS), the latter of which was awarded the Management & Operation (M&O) contract to operate Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, on May 8, 2007, to commence on October 1, 2007

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
