Tipifarnib - Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma - Kura Oncology

























































Tipifarnib – Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma

Our lead drug candidate, tipifarnib, is an inhibitor of protein farnesylation, a key cell signaling process implicated in cancer initiation and development. Tipifarnib has been studied in more than 5,000 patients and has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in certain patient subsets and a well-established safety profile. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that in the right therapeutic context, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options.
PTCL consists of a group of rare and usually aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that develop from mature T-cells. A prior Phase 2 trial of tipifarnib was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted at the Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa, in adult patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoma. The results of this study suggest that tipifarnib can be administered for prolonged periods and may produce durable responses as a single agent in relapsed lymphoma within a group of patients, who were heavily pretreated, including those with PTCL.
PCTL represents approximately 5-10% of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, or NHL, which corresponds to an annual incidence of approximately 5,000 patients in the United States.
Tipifarnib is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL.

Kura Oncology Announces Issuance of U.S. Patent for Lead Product Candidate Tipifarnib in Head and Neck Cancer
New Patent Provides Exclusivity to 2036



















July 18, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: Kura Oncology, Inc.






SAN DIEGO, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of precision medicines for oncology, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent protecting the company's lead product candidate, tipifarnib, which is currently being studied in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. The patent includes multiple claims directed to the use of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and has an expiration date of August 2036, excluding any possible patent term extension. “Our goal is to identify genetically-defined patient populations in which tipifarnib will demonstrate enhanced therapeutic activity and to pursue patent protection in those indications,” said Troy Wilson, Ph.D., President and CEO of Kura Oncology. “The granting of this new patent is a major milestone for Kura, and it illustrates the potential of our broader strategy to generate intellectual property related to tipifarnib and its use in treating human diseases.” U.S. Patent No. 9,707,221, entitled “Methods of Treating Cancer Patients with Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors” is directed to the use of tipifarnib for treating patients with relapsed and/or refractory HRAS SCCHN. About HRAS Mutant SCCHN  Head and neck cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with squamous cell carcinomas accounting for most head and neck cancers. The relapsed and/or refractory SCCHN patient population has an overall survival of approximately 6-8 months and few therapeutic options. New therapies for SCCHN, including immunotherapy, typically show a response rate in the range of 10-20%. HRAS is a proto-oncogene that has been implicated in the development and progression of SCCHN. HRAS mutant SCCHN has an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2,800 to 3,400 patients in the U.S. and represents a significant unmet medical need. About Tipifarnib Kura Oncology’s lead program, tipifarnib, is an inhibitor of farnesylation, a key cell signaling process implicated in cancer initiation and development. In extensive clinical trials, tipifarnib has shown a well-established safety profile and compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patient subsets. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that, in the appropriate context, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options. Leveraging advances in next-generation sequencing as well as emerging information about cancer genetics and tumor biology, Kura Oncology is seeking to identify patients most likely to benefit from tipifarnib. About Kura Oncology Kura Oncology is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. The company’s pipeline consists of small molecule drug candidates that target cancer signaling pathways where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve outcomes by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from treatment. Kura Oncology’s lead drug candidate is tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, which is currently being studied in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. Kura’s pipeline also includes KO-947, an ERK inhibitor, currently in a Phase 1 trial, and KO-539, an inhibitor of the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction, currently in preclinical testing. For additional information about Kura Oncology, please visit the company’s website at www.kuraoncology.com.

Kura Oncology Presents Preliminary Clinical and Preclinical Data for Tipifarnib in the Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma
Jun 14 17
Kura Oncology, Inc. announced that clinical and preclinical data for tipifarnib in the treatment of relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) was presented at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (ICML) being held June 14-17, 2017 in Lugano, Switzerland. Kura Oncology is conducting preclinical and clinical development studies in clinical indications where tipifarnib has previously shown signs of activity with the goal to identify and validate biomarkers associated with the observed clinical activity of tipifarnib. The preliminary Phase 2 clinical data presented at ICML indicate that tipifarnib has antitumor activity in PTCL, particularly in patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) histology and PTCL-NOS (Not Otherwise Specified) histology with high levels of CXCL12 gene expression and absence of single nucleotide gene variations in the 3'-untranslated region of the CXCL12 gene. Patients with PTCL have a poor overall survival of about 40%. Effective options for relapsed patients are limited and new drugs with novel mechanisms of action are needed. These results identify the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway as a potential target of tipifarnib.  CXCL12 is secreted in large amounts by lymph nodes, bone marrow stroma, liver, and lung, and plays key roles in tumor invasion, bone marrow homing and site of metastasis. Its receptor, CXCR4, signals in part through HRAS, a protein that is uniquely farnesylated, and it is one of the most frequently over-expressed chemokine receptors in malignant cells. Patients in the Phase 2 study received tipifarnib 600 mg orally twice daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 in 28-day cycles. Among the 18 patients in stages 1 and 2 of this trial, 3 achieved a partial response (PR), and two of the PRs occurred in the two patients on study with AITL. An additional 4 patients had meaningful tumor size reductions and prolonged disease stabilization. In addition, tipifarnib was generally well-tolerated with adverse events consistent with its known safety profile and no patient discontinued due to adverse events. The Phase 2 study has been extended to enroll an additional 12 patients with AITL histology aimed at confirming the preliminary observations and validating CXCL12 as a biomarker of tipifarnib activity.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Kura Oncology Announces Issuance of U.S. Patent for Lead Product Candidate Tipifarnib in Head and Neck Cancer
New Patent Provides Exclusivity to 2036



















July 18, 2017 07:30 ET

 | Source: Kura Oncology, Inc.






SAN DIEGO, July  18, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of precision medicines for oncology, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent protecting the company's lead product candidate, tipifarnib, which is currently being studied in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. The patent includes multiple claims directed to the use of tipifarnib in patients with HRAS mutant squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and has an expiration date of August 2036, excluding any possible patent term extension. “Our goal is to identify genetically-defined patient populations in which tipifarnib will demonstrate enhanced therapeutic activity and to pursue patent protection in those indications,” said Troy Wilson, Ph.D., President and CEO of Kura Oncology. “The granting of this new patent is a major milestone for Kura, and it illustrates the potential of our broader strategy to generate intellectual property related to tipifarnib and its use in treating human diseases.” U.S. Patent No. 9,707,221, entitled “Methods of Treating Cancer Patients with Farnesyltransferase Inhibitors” is directed to the use of tipifarnib for treating patients with relapsed and/or refractory HRAS SCCHN. About HRAS Mutant SCCHN  Head and neck cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with squamous cell carcinomas accounting for most head and neck cancers. The relapsed and/or refractory SCCHN patient population has an overall survival of approximately 6-8 months and few therapeutic options. New therapies for SCCHN, including immunotherapy, typically show a response rate in the range of 10-20%. HRAS is a proto-oncogene that has been implicated in the development and progression of SCCHN. HRAS mutant SCCHN has an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2,800 to 3,400 patients in the U.S. and represents a significant unmet medical need. About Tipifarnib Kura Oncology’s lead program, tipifarnib, is an inhibitor of farnesylation, a key cell signaling process implicated in cancer initiation and development. In extensive clinical trials, tipifarnib has shown a well-established safety profile and compelling and durable anti-cancer activity in certain patient subsets. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that, in the appropriate context, tipifarnib has the potential to provide significant benefit to cancer patients with limited treatment options. Leveraging advances in next-generation sequencing as well as emerging information about cancer genetics and tumor biology, Kura Oncology is seeking to identify patients most likely to benefit from tipifarnib. About Kura Oncology Kura Oncology is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. The company’s pipeline consists of small molecule drug candidates that target cancer signaling pathways where there is a strong scientific and clinical rationale to improve outcomes by identifying those patients most likely to benefit from treatment. Kura Oncology’s lead drug candidate is tipifarnib, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, which is currently being studied in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials. Kura’s pipeline also includes KO-947, an ERK inhibitor, currently in a Phase 1 trial, and KO-539, an inhibitor of the menin-MLL protein-protein interaction, currently in preclinical testing.
