Product Description▼▲
The Gospel of Mark [PNTC] offers exceptional commentary that clearly shows the second Gospel--though it was a product of the earliest Christian community--to be both relevant and sorely needed in today's church. Written by a biblical scholar who has devoted thirty years to the study of the second Gospel, Edwards aims to interpret Mark according to its theological intentions and purposes, especially as they relate to the life and ministry of Jesus and the call to discipleship. Unique features Edwards' approach include clear descriptions of key terms used by Mark and revealing discussion of the Gospel's literary features, including Mark's use of the "sandwich" technique and of imagistic motifs and irony. Edwards also proposes a new paradigm for interpreting the difficult "Little Apocalypse" of chapter 13, and he argues for a new understanding of Mark's controversial ending.

Author Bio▼▲
James R. Edwards is the Bruner-Welch Endowed Professor of Theology at Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington. His other books include Is Jesus the Only Savior? the 2006 Christianity Today Book of the Year in Apologetics.


Endorsements▼▲
-Ralph P. Martin
James Edwards's new, careful study of the earliest Gospel brings together his interest in and ongoing research regarding Mark's work. He does so in a way that will have a broad appeal to a wide audience, including both the academic community and the service of pastors and teachers. This is an excellent piece of applied research and rigorous study.
The Bible Today
Based on the New International Version of the Bible and often making reference to the nuance of the Greek original, the commentary provides the reader with a clear, well-informed, and thoughtful interpretation of Marks Gospel.
Southwestern Journal of Theology
The present volume should have broad appeal to lay persons, ministers, and scholars as it fits within Pillars purpose of exacting, accurate exegesis without being overly technical. Yet, this commentary is not a lightweight: the text and footnotes reflect both rigorous research and a thorough use of the most recent Markan scholarship.

            The Pillar New Testament Commentary is written with the understanding that God stands over us; "we do not stand in judgment of him." This perspective protects against some of the more speculative and skeptical approaches to Bible study. Edwards's approach is definitely in harmony with the aim of the series. The style of writing is both informative and interesting. Many commentaries attempt to meet the needs of scholars and lay persons. Edwards actually succeeds in doing so. The introduction is also very well written. I highly recommend it.

            James Edwards' presentation of the Gospel of Mark is refreshing and equally stimulating.  His scholastic disciplines are evident, yet his material is readable and can be understood by those just beginning their walk of faith.  I recommend this work to any seeking a deeper understanding of the importance of this Gospel.

Product Description▼▲
In this timely book for believers, inquirers, and skeptics alike, James R. Edwards faces head-on the question of whether or not Jesus is indeed the sole savior of the world. After tracing the currents of modernity from the Enlightenment to the Jesus Seminar, Edwards contends that the assumptions of the most skeptical historical-Jesus scholars are no more intellectually defensible than the claims of faith. He then assembles extensive support to show that Jesus considered himself the unique and saving mission of God to the world. Edwards devotes the second half of the book to discussing Jesus as savior in light of contemporary cultural currents, specifically addressing the thorny issues of religious pluralism, moral relativism, postmodernism, and the quest for world peace. Illustrated with real-life stories, Is Jesus the Only Savior? gives a fair hearing to twenty-first-century concerns while upholding historic Christian faith.

S. Smith






  
            This book gives excellent historical and biblical evidence for a logical argument of Jesus as the ONLY savior.  His vocabulary is a little tough to follow at times, but he concludes every point with easy to understand examples.  This is a great book for Sunday school or small group discussion.

Product Description
Publisher Description: This new Pillar volume offers exceptional commentary on Mark that clearly shows the second Gospel — though it was a product of the earliest Christian community — to be both relevant and sorely needed in today's church.Written by a biblical scholar who has devoted thirty years to the study of the second Gospel, this commentary aims primarily to interpret the Gosepl of Mark according to its theological intentions and purposes, especially as they relate to the life and ministry of Jesus and the call to faith and discipleship. Unique features of James Edwards's approach include clear descriptions of key terms used by Mark and revealing discussion of the Gospel's literary features, including Mark's use of the "sandwich" technique and of imagistic motifs and irony. Edwards also proposes a new paradigm for interpreting the difficult "Little Apocalypse" of chapter 13, and he argues for a new understanding of Mark's controversial ending.

Product Description
In keeping with the Pillar New Testament Commentary's distinctive character, this volume by James R. Edwards on Luke gives special attention to the Third Gospel's vocabulary and historical setting, its narrative purpose and unique themes, and its theological significance for the church and believers today.Though Luke is often thought to have a primarily Gentile focus, Edwards counterbalances that perspective by citing numerous evidences of Luke's overarching interest in depicting Jesus as the fulfillment of God's providential work in the history of Israel, and he even considers the possibility that Luke himself was a Jew. In several excursuses Edwards discusses particular topics, including Luke's infancy narratives, the mission of Jesus as the way of salvation, and Luke's depiction of the universal scope of the gospel.While fully conversant with all the latest scholarship, Edwards writes in a lively, fluent style that will commend this commentary to ministers, students, scholars, and many other serious Bible readers."

DESCRIPTION
Series:  The Pillar New Testament Commentary  (PNTC)This new Pillar volume  offers exceptional commentary on Mark  that clearly shows the second Gospel --  though it was a product of the earliest  Christian community -- to be both  relevant and sorely needed in today's  church.Written by a biblical  scholar who has devoted thirty years to  the study of the second Gospel, this  commentary aims primarily to  interpret the Gosepl of Mark  according to its theological intentions  and purposes, especially as they relate  to the life and ministry of Jesus and  the call to faith and discipleship.  Unique features of James Edwards's  approach include clear descriptions of  key terms used by Mark and revealing  discussion of the Gospel's literary  features, including Mark's use of the  "sandwich" technique and of imagistic  motifs and irony. Edwards also proposes  a new paradigm for interpreting the  difficult "Little Apocalypse" of chapter  13, and he argues for a new  understanding of Mark's controversial  ending.
			





REVIEWS

Southwestern Journal of Theology"The present volume should have broad appeal to lay persons, ministers, and scholars as it fits within Pillar's purpose of exacting, accurate exegesis without being overly technical. Yet, this commentary is not a lightweight: the text and footnotes reflect both rigorous research and a thorough use of the most recent Markan scholarship."        

The Bible Today"Based on the New International Version of the Bible and often making reference to the nuance of the Greek original, the commentary provides the reader with a clear, well-informed, and thoughtful interpretation of Mark's Gospel."     

Ralph P. Martin"James Edwards's new, careful study of the earliest Gospel brings together his interest in and ongoing research regarding Mark's work. He does so in a way that will have a broad appeal to a wide audience, including both the academic community and the service of pastors and teachers. This is an excellent piece of applied research and rigorous study."

The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition[edit]
In 2009 he advanced a controversial theory that the synoptic Gospels are partly dependent on the "Hebrew Gospel" which includes Gospel of the Hebrews, a syncretic Jewish–Christian text believed by most scholars to have been composed in Koine Greek, the Hebrew Gospel hypothesis of Lessing and others, and traditions of a writing of Matthew's supposed to have been written by him “in the Hebrew language” (Papias) and Hebrew Gospel of Matthew, 1385, a rabbinical translation of Matthew's gospel.[2][3][4] Edwards argues that patristic citations from "the Hebrew Gospel" correlate more distinctly and repeatedly with sections called "Special Luke" in Gospel of Luke than with either Gospel of Matthew or Gospel of Mark.[5]
Two separate reviews were published by the Society of Biblical Literature.[6][7]
Edwards also rejects the modern division, by Schneemelcher and others, of the Jewish-Christian Gospels' fragments into three or more separate lost Gospels.

^ The Whitworthian Monday, November 23, 2009 "Professor's book 'controversial' - News "Edwards said the Hebrew Gospel has remained largely unstudied in the theological world and, in his opinion, has been scandalously overlooked. "Most scholars don't know much about the Hebrew gospel and many deny that it existed," he said. Throughout history, Edwards said, Christians have been hesitant to accept a Hebrew ancestor to the gospels. The theory of the Hebrew Gospel is still unpopular with many in the theological world. Though no copies of the Hebrew Gospel are known to exist, Edwards' research and study of ancient manuscripts has convinced him to believe unwaveringly that it once did. "We know [the Hebrew Gospel] did exist because it was referred to about 100 times in the first nine centuries of Christianity," he said."

^ James R. Edwards - The Hebrew Gospel and the Development of the Synoptic Tradition 2009 "In Chapters Two and Three I attempt to show that when the fathers actually quote from the Hebrew Gospel the quotations correlate more distinctly and repeatedly with Special Luke than with either Matthew or Mark. The fourth chapter shifts from a survey of the patristic tradition to a detailed discussion of Lukan Semitisms in which the above thesis is argued on the dual basis of philological evidence in Luke and the testimony of the prologue."

Martin Luther called Romans the clearest gospel of all. But centuries of interpretive tradition and dogma have muddied the waters. Edwards's careful exposition pays attention to literary detail and historical context to clarify the Epistle's significance for its original readers and for the church today. The NIBC format (section-by-section exposition of the NIV, all Greek transliterated, and separate textual and technical notes) make this commentary ideal for laypeople and pastors.
