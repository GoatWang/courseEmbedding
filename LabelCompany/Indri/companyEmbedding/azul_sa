We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of preferred shares,
including in the form of ADSs, in this global offering will be approximately
R$[ ] million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses payable by us,
and assuming an initial public offering of R$[ ] per preferred share (and U.S.$
[ ] per ADS, based on an exchange rate of R$[ ] to U.S.$1.00 as of [ ], 2013),
which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus.

We are undertaking this global offering in order to access the public capital
markets with the main objective of financing our future expansion plans. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this global offering for the following
purposes:

    •    [ ] million to invest in aircraft to grow our fleet;

    •    [ ] million to fund the capital expenditures needed to increase the number
         of destinations in our network;                                           

    •    [ ] million to repay the debt of R$120 million that we owe to Bozano under
         the loan agreements. This indebtedness carries interest at a rate of  
         10.1% per year and is due to be repaid in full on June 29, 2014, but 
         will become immediately payable upon the initial public offering of our
         preferred shares. The proceeds of this indebtedness were used for 
         working capital needs;                                                            

    •    [ ] million to repay a total of U.S.$12.2 million (approximately          
         R$24.5 million, calculated at the exchange rate of R$2.0138 per U.S.$1.00 
         at March 31, 2013) which is the aggregate amount outstanding on five      
         junior loans we guarantee that will become immediately due and payable,   
         following our initial public offering; and                                    

    •    [ ] million for general corporate purposes.

We will not receive any proceeds from the offering of preferred shares,
including in the form of ADSs, by the Selling Shareholders, assuming the
over-allotment option is exercised, who we estimate will receive net proceeds of
R$[ ] million in this global offering assuming the full exercise of the options
to purchase additional preferred shares, including in the form of ADSs.


The two largest airlines in Brazil are Gol and TAM. Both Gol and TAM operate
similar hub-and-spoke networks, which require that passengers on many of their
routes connect through the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Brasília. We
face competition from Gol, TAM and other airlines, such as low-cost carriers and
potential new entrant airlines on all our routes that are also served by any of
these airlines. The principal competitive factors on these routes that are
served by more than one airline are: fare pricing, total price, flight
schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a
city, customer service, safety record and reputation, code sharing
relationships, and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities.

As a result of our innovative business model, which is based on stimulating
demand in underserved markets, we are less susceptible to the effects of fare
competition involving our two main competitors, which fly from the airports in
the city of São Paulo. While Gol, TAM or any other airline may enter the markets
we currently serve exclusively or which we hold a large market share, we believe
that our business model is unique and allows us to avoid competition in numerous
of the markets we serve, in particular from our competitors operating larger 
aircraft such as Gol and TAM. 

Before we started our operations, Gol and TAM controlled over 90% of the
Brazilian airline market. Since December 2008, the Brazilian airline market has
grown significantly, partially because of (i) our entry into the market, which
stimulated demand, and (ii) the organic growth of the market, with more
individuals using airline transportation services. As a result, despite the fact
that Gol and TAM lost market share following our entry into the market, the
number of passengers transported by both airlines increased in that time period.
As of March 31, 2013, we had a 17% market share of domestic RPKs, according to
ANAC, and a 30% market share of domestic departures, according to Innovata.

Even though our principal competitors on many of our routes are Gol and TAM, as
of December 2012, we competed with TAM and Gol on only 26.6% of our routes. In
Campinas, our primary hub, only four out of 43 routes faced direct competition
from Gol or TAM as of December 2012. The following table provides details with
respect to the competition faced on our top five routes, based on weekly
frequency as of March 2013.

                                                    At March 31, 2012

In addition to other airlines, our competitors also include companies catering
to other forms of transportation, principally bus services. Notwithstanding
competition generated from other forms of transportation, the middle class in
Brazil is expanding and air travel is becoming an affordable option to such
growing middle class. We believe that most of our fares are competitive with the
cost of road travel on many of our routes, in particular the discounted fares we
offer based on our yield management system for advance purchases.


Company Description
We were founded by entrepreneur David Neeleman in 2008 and are the latest of his
four airline ventures with sustained operational viability from inception to
date in three different countries, including JetBlue Airways. Backed by
Mr. Neeleman and other key shareholders such as Weston Presidio, TPG


 Growth,
Gávea Investimentos, Grupo Bozano, and Grupo Águia Branca, we are highly
capitalized and have invested in a robust and scalable business model. We have a
management team that combines local knowledge with experience in best practices
from the United States, the world's largest and most competitive aviation
market.

In 2012 we acquired TRIP, which at the time was the largest regional carrier in
South America by number of destinations. As a result of the TRIP Acquisition, we
began service in 46 additional cities. The fleet similarity between Azul and
TRIP has allowed us to integrate all our operations rapidly and start yielding
synergy gains (as measured by the sum of estimated revenue synergies plus
estimated net cost synergies) of R$200 million to R$300 million in 2013 and
R$300 million to R$400 million in 2014. The acquisition substantially increased
our network connectivity, enabling us to become the leading carrier by
departures in 70 cities as of December 31, 2012 and consolidate our position as
a leader in Brazil's fast-growing regional aviation market. Through the
acquisition, we became the leading carrier in Belo Horizonte, Brazil's third
largest metropolitan area, and gained strategic landing rights at Guarulhos
airport in São Paulo and Santos Dumont airport in Rio de Janeiro, complementing
our hub at Campinas in the state of São Paulo.

We believe we have created a robust network of profitable routes by stimulating
demand through frequent and affordable air service. We select routes that we
believe possess high demand and growth potential and are either not served or
underserved by other airlines. We believe this model has enabled us to stimulate
significant new demand to become the market leader in the majority of the
markets we serve.

Our fleet of 118 aircraft in service, composed of 68 modern Embraer E-Jets,
which seat up to 118 customers, and 50 fuel-efficient ATR aircraft, which seat
up to 70 customers, allows us to effectively match capacity to demand and offer
more convenient and frequent non-stop service than our main competitors, who fly
larger aircraft. We believe this structure not only stimulates demand from
business travelers, who tend to travel more as a result of increased flight
frequencies, but also attracts cost-conscious leisure travelers, many of whom
are first time flyers, by offering low fares for advance purchases. In addition,
our aircraft enable us to serve smaller markets profitably and connect them to
our extensive network. With an average age of four years at December 31, 2012,
our fleet is younger than those of our main competitors, Gol and TAM.

We believe we have built a strong brand by offering a high-quality travel
experience, based on a culture of customer service provided by a team of
crewmembers who we train to be highly motivated and cultivated through the past
ventures of our founder David Neeleman. Among other awards, we were named "Best
Low Cost Carrier In The World" in 2012 by CAPA, an independent aviation market
intelligence provider, and "Best Low Cost Carrier In Latin America" in both 2012
and 2011 by Skytrax, an aviation research organization. Our service offering
features individual entertainment screens incorporating free LiveTV at every
seat on virtually all of our jets, extensive legroom with a pitch of 30 inches
or more, two-by-two seating with no middle seats, complimentary beverage and
snack services, and free bus service to key airports (including between the city
of São Paulo and Campinas airport).

As of March 31, 2013, we were the market leader by frequency on 80.8% of our
routes, as the only airline operating on 70.7% of our routes and the most
frequent carrier on an additional 10.1% of our routes, according to IATA. This
extensive network coverage allows us to offer more itineraries and connections
than our competitors, which serve a significantly lower number of destinations.
We believe that this leading network position has enabled us to achieve
significantly higher PRASK than other domestic carriers in the four-year period
ended March 31, 2013. In 2012, we achieved an average load factor of 79% and
generated a 55% PRASK premium relative to Gol, according to its year-end 2012
public disclosure. In addition, for the three months ended March 31, 2013, we
maintained an average load factor of 79% and generated a 62% PRASK premium
relative to Gol, according to its quarterly results of operations filed with the
SEC for the first quarter of 2013.

Utilizing smaller aircraft with lower fuel consumption, gives us trip costs
lower than those of our main competitors. For example, our end-of-period FTEs
per operating aircraft was the lowest in Brazil, at 77 compared to 173 for LATAM
and 126 for Gol as of March 31, 2013, according to their end of first quarter
2013 public disclosures. Our leading revenue performance driven by superior load
factors, combined with our efficient operations and competitive cost structure,
enabled us to achieve an Adjusted EBITDAR margin for the three months ended
March 31, 2013 of 25.1% compared to 17.6% for Gol, our main competitor,
according to its quarterly results of operations filed with the SEC for the
first quarter of 2013. For a description of how we calculate Adjusted EBITDAR,
see "-Summary Financial and Operating Data" below.

Unlike other airlines' loyalty programs, our loyalty program, Tudo Azul, rewards
customers for the amount of money paid for flights as opposed to the number of
miles flown. The program had more than 750,000 enrolled members at December 31,
2009, and more than 2,400,000 members at March 31, 2013. We have plans to expand
the scope of Tudo Azul through commercial partnerships with companies from other
industries where we believe our brand provides a competitive advantage, such as
Azul-branded credit cards. Our current Tudo Azul partners include Banco Itaú,
Banco Santander, American Express and Walmart, among numerous others. As Tudo
Azul expands, we may consider managing it as a separate business unit.

Our hub-and-spoke network is an integral part of our model of stimulating demand
since it allows us to consolidate traffic by serving larger and medium-sized
markets (including every state capital in Brazil) as well as smaller cities that
do not generate sufficient demand for point-to-point service. We believe our
main competitors, with their larger aircraft, are unable to generate sufficient
demand to serve most of our markets profitably.

Our main hubs are located in Campinas and Belo Horizonte, two of the largest
metropolitan areas in the country. Campinas is located approximately 90
kilometers (56 miles) from the city of São Paulo and has a catchment area of
approximately seven million people in a 100km radius, according to IBGE. We are
the leading airline at Campinas, with a 95.7% share of the airport's 166 daily
departures as of March 31, 2013. As a result of heightened demand driven by our
entry into Campinas, as of March 31, 2013, the Campinas airport served 48
destinations, the most non-stop domestic flights of any Brazilian airport. Other
key strategic destinations in our network include the cities of São Paulo
(Guarulhos airport), Rio de Janeiro (Santos Dumont and Galeão airports),
Salvador and Manaus.

Brazil, which is geographically similar in size to the continental United
States, had the second fastest-growing domestic aviation market in the world in
2012 and is expected to be the third largest market for domestic passengers in
2016 according to IATA. We believe Brazil continues to show significant growth
potential as air travel is still significantly underpenetrated, with 0.5 average
flight segments flown per person per year, compared to 2.1 in a mature market
such as the United States in 2012.

The core of our strategy is to drive greater profitability by growing our
network, adding new destinations, further interconnecting our current
destinations, and increasing frequency in existing markets. We believe this
continued roll-out will stimulate further demand, reducing CASK and increasing
margins through the economies of scale created by optimizing our resources and
staff. We also intend to continue growing our ancillary revenue streams, such as
cargo operations and travel packages, by leveraging our existing products and
expanding our offerings.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of preferred shares, 
including in the form of ADSs, in this global offering will be approximately 
R$[      ] million, after deducting commissions and estimated expenses payable 
by us, and assuming an initial public offering of R$[      ] per preferred 
share (and US$ [      ] per ADS, based on an exchange rate of R$[      ] to 
US$1.00 as of [       ], 2014), which is the midpoint of the range set forth 
on the cover of this prospectus. 

We are undertaking this global offering in order to access the public capital 
markets with the main objective of financing our future expansion plans. We 
intend to use the net proceeds from this global offering for the following 
purposes: 

. [        ] million to invest in E-Jets and ATRs to grow our fleet;  

. [        ] million to fund the capital expenditures needed to increase the 
  number of destinations in our network;  

. [        ] million to repay (i) the outstanding amount of US$39.9 million 
  under a credit agreement with Citibank (this indebtedness carries interest 
  at a rate of 2.25% per year and is due to be repaid in full on March 31, 
  2016); (ii) the outstanding amount of US$22.4 million under a credit agreement 
  with Banco Safra (this indebtedness accrues interest at a rate of 4.05% per 
  year and is due to be repaid in full on April 1, 2015); and (iii) the 
  outstanding amount of R$103.2 million under the promissory notes(these notes 
  accrue interest at a rate of 118% of the CDI and are due to be repaid in full 
  on December 27, 2014). The proceeds of this indebtedness were used to finance 
  our working capital requirements. 

. [        ] million for general corporate purposes.  

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of preferred shares, including 
in the form of ADSs, by the Selling Shareholders. We will receive a nominal 
amount in connection with the issuance of new preferred shares to the Private 
Placement Investors as a result of the exercise of Warrants. These Warrants
will be exercisable only if the final offering price is lower than the midpoint 
of the indicative price range in this global offering. 

The total amount of estimated proceeds from this offering excludes any proceeds 
resulting from the exercise of stock options that will be vested and exercisable 
following completion of this offering.


Domestic

The two largest airlines in Brazil are Gol and TAM. Both Gol and TAM operate
similar hub-and-spoke networks, which require that passengers on many of their
routes connect through the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro or Brasília. We
face competition from Gol, TAM and other airlines, such as low-cost carriers and
potential new entrant airlines on all our routes that are also served by any of
these airlines. The principal competitive factors on these routes that are
served by more than one airline are: fare pricing, total price, flight
schedules, aircraft type, passenger amenities, number of routes served from a
city, customer service, safety record and reputation, code sharing
relationships, and frequent flyer programs and redemption opportunities.

As a result of our innovative business model, which is based on stimulating
demand in underserved markets, we are less susceptible to the effects of fare
competition involving our two main competitors, which fly from the airports in
the city of São Paulo. While Gol, TAM or any other airline may enter the markets
we currently serve exclusively or which we hold a large market share, we believe
that our business model allows us to avoid competition in numerous of the
markets we serve, in particular from our competitors operating larger aircraft
such as Gol and TAM.

Before we started our operations, Gol and TAM controlled over 90% of the
Brazilian airline market. From 2008 to 2012, the Brazilian airline market has
grown significantly, partially because of (i) our entry into the market, which
stimulated demand, and (ii) the organic growth of the market, with more
individuals using airline transportation services. As a result, despite the fact
that Gol and TAM lost market share following our entry into the market, the
number of passengers transported by both airlines increased in that time period.
As of September 30, 2014, we had a 16.8% market share of domestic RPKs,
according to ANAC.

Even though our principal competitors on many of our routes are Gol and TAM, as
of December 2013, we competed with TAM and Gol on only 29.4% of our routes. In
Campinas, our primary hub, only six out of 53 destinations faced direct
competition from Gol or TAM as of December 2013. The following table provides
details with respect to the competition faced on our top five routes, based on
weekly frequency as of September 30, 2014.

                                                     At September 30, 2014

In addition to other airlines, our competitors also include companies catering
to other forms of transportation, principally bus services. Notwithstanding
competition generated from other forms of transportation, the middle class in
Brazil is expanding and air travel is becoming an affordable option to such
growing middle class. We believe that most of our fares are competitive with the
cost of road travel on many of our routes, in particular the discounted fares we
offer based on our yield management system for advance purchases.

International

As we expand our international services to select international destinations,
our pool of competitors will increase and we will face competition from
Brazilian, United States, South American and other foreign airlines that are
already established in the international market and that participate in
strategic alliances and code-sharearrangements. In addition, non-Brazilian
airlines may decide to enter or increase their schedules in the market for
routes between Brazil and other international destinations.

In 2010, ANAC approved regulations regarding international fares for flights
departing from Brazil to the United States and Europe, which gradually removes
the previous minimum fares. In 2010, ANAC approved the continuity of bilateral
agreements providing for open skies policies with other South American
countries, as well as a new open skies policy with the United States that is
expected come into force in 2015. In March 2011, Brazil also signed an open
skies agreement with Europe that is expected come into force in 2014. These new
regulations should increase the number of passengers in South America and may
enable the expansion of our international services. On the other hand, we may
face further competition on this expanded South American market.


Company Description
We have been the fastest growing airline in Brazil in terms of ASKs since we
commenced operations in December 2008 and currently have the largest airline
network in the country in terms of cities served, with service at September 30,
2014 to 103 destinations, 217 routes and 864 departures per day.


 We are in the
process of expanding our operations with selected non-stop service to
high-demand locations in the United States, which we expect to launch in
December 2014. Our model is to stimulate demand by providing frequent and
affordable air service to underserved markets, with the result that we are the
sole airline on 64.9% of our existing routes and have a 31.6% share of the
Brazilian aviation market in terms of departures.

We were founded by entrepreneur David Neeleman and are the latest of his four
airline ventures with sustained operational viability in three different
countries, including JetBlue Airways. Backed by Mr. Neeleman and other key
shareholders such as Weston Presidio, TPG Growth, Fidelity, Gávea Investimentos
and Grupo Bozano, we are highly capitalized and have invested in a robust and
scalable business model. We have a management team that combines local knowledge
with diversified experience in and knowledge of best practices from the United
States, the world’s largest and most competitive aviation market.

In 2012 we acquired TRIP, which at the time was the largest regional carrier in
South America by number of destinations and have consolidated its results of
operations into our financial statements since November 30, 2012. The
acquisition substantially increased our network connectivity, enabling us to
become the leading carrier by departures in 66 cities as of September 30, 2014
and consolidate our position as the leader in Brazil’s fast-growing regional
aviation market. Through the acquisition, we became the leading carrier in Belo
Horizonte, Brazil’s third largest metropolitan area and gained strategic landing
rights at Guarulhos airport in São Paulo and Santos Dumont airport in Rio de
Janeiro, complementing our hub at Campinas in the state of São Paulo. In
addition, our operating results have significantly improved since the
acquisition, reflecting what we believe are the synergy gains of our combined
networks.

We believe we have created a robust network of profitable routes by stimulating
demand through frequent and affordable air service. We select routes that we
believe possess high demand and growth potential and are either not served or
underserved by other airlines. We believe we can continue expanding our domestic
network while simultaneously leveraging the strong connectivity we have created
in Brazil to benefit from the addition of select international destinations in
the United States.

Our flexible fleet enables us to serve smaller and larger markets by connecting
them to our extensive network of destinations. Our operating fleet of 128
aircraft, composed of 77 modern Embraer E-Jets, which seat up to 118 customers,
and 51 fuel-efficient ATR aircraft, which seat up to 70 customers, allows us to
effectively match capacity to demand and offer more convenient and frequent
non-stop service than our main competitors, who exclusively fly larger aircraft
within Brazil. We believe this structure not only stimulates demand from
business travelers, who tend to travel more as a result of increased flight
frequencies, but also attracts cost-conscious leisure travelers, many of whom
are first time flyers, by offering low fares for advance purchases. Our current
business plan contemplates the addition of next-generation narrowbody and
widebody aircraft, which are more fuel-efficient than current generation
aircraft. As fuel represents more than 35% of our total operating costs, we
believe that the addition of next-generation aircraft will allow us to further
improve the efficiency of our fleet. We believe that our strategic fleet plan 
will allow us to maintain industry-leading trip costs and further reduce our 
CASK, both in absolute terms and relative to our competitors. With an average 
age of 3.6 years at September 30, 2014, our operating fleet is younger than 
that of our main competitors, Gol and TAM. In addition, we expect that the a
cquisition of larger narrowbody and widebody aircraft will allow us to further 
enhance profitability when servicing high-density markets that allow for the 
profitable use of larger aircraft as well as to service select international 
destinations.

We believe we have built a strong brand by offering a high-quality travel
experience, based on a culture of customer service provided by a highly
motivated team of crewmembers. Among other awards we were named “Best Low Cost
Carrier in Latin America” in 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 by Skytrax, an
independent aviation research organization, and “Best Low Cost Carrier in The
World” in 2012 by CAPA, an independent aviation research organization. Our
domestic service offering features individual entertainment screens
incorporating free LiveTV at every seat on virtually all of our jets, extensive
legroom with a pitch of 30 inches or more, two-by-two seating with no middle
seats, complimentary beverage and snack services, and free bus service to key
airports (including between the city of São Paulo and Campinas airport).

As of September 30, 2014, we were the market leader by frequency on 76.2% of our
routes, as the only airline operating on 64.9% of our routes and the most
frequent carrier on an additional 11.3% of our routes, according to Innovata
data. This extensive network coverage allows us to offer more itineraries and
connections than our competitors, which serve a significantly smaller number of
destinations. We believe that this leading network position has enabled us to
achieve significantly higher PRASK than other domestic carriers in the five-year
period ended December 31, 2013. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we
had an average load factor of 80% and generated a 43% PRASK premium relative to
Gol, according to its publicly available results of operations furnished to the
SEC for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

We believe that by using the right-sized aircraft for the markets we serve we
are able to have lower trip costs than our competitors. Our fleet of ATR and
E-Jets enables us to penetrate markets that our competitors, who only fly larger
narrowbody aircraft, cannot serve profitably. Our modern E-Jets seat up to 118
customers, and our fuel-efficient ATR aircraft seat up to 70 customers, while
the narrowbody aircraft used by our two principal competitors in Brazil have
between 144 and 220 seats and are therefore not suited to serve markets with
lower demand profitably. As a result, the average trip cost for our combined
fleet of E-jets and ATRs is 35.3% lower than that of larger Boeing 737-800 jets
flown by Gol, our main competitor, according to its results of operations
furnished to the SEC for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In addition,
our end-of-period FTEs per aircraft as of September 30, 2014 was the lowest in
Brazil, at 73 compared to 171 for LATAM and 115 for Gol as of September 30,
2014, according to their respective results of operations furnished to the SEC
for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. We expect to continue to utilize
our Embraer E-Jets to service high-demand routes targeted at business travelers
and our ATR aircraft to service short-haul and smaller regional airports and to
continue to seek to provide low cost air service to these cities and locations.
We also plan to receive new next-generation Airbus A320neos, which are more
fuel-efficient than current generation narrowbody aircraft, starting in 2016 to
serve domestic long-haul routes with high-demand targeted at leisure travelers,
including the Northeast of Brazil. We have recently announced an intention to
begin limited international service and are acquiring new aircraft for this and
expanded domestic service. We believe that our leading revenue performance 
driven by superior load factors, combined with our efficient operations and 
competitive cost structure, enabled us to achieve an Adjusted EBITDAR margin 
of 23.2% in 2013 and 22.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In 
2013, we  generated total revenues of R$5.2 billion (US$2.1 billion) and a net 
income of  R$20.7 million (US$8.4 million) and for the nine months ended 
September 30,  2014 our revenues totaled R$4.2 billion (US$1.7 billion) with a 
net loss of  R$63.2 million (US$25.8 million).

With more than 4.0 million members as of September 30, 2014, our loyalty
program, TudoAzul, has been the fastest growing frequent flyer program among our
two main competitors for the past 3 years according to information publicly
available on the websites of Smiles and Multiplus. We believe our program has a
more efficient cost structure as it rewards customers for the amount paid for
flights as opposed to the number of miles flown, thereby seeking to create a
stronger link between passenger revenue and loyalty rewards. We are expanding
the scope of TudoAzul and have launched an Azul branded credit card in September
of 2014 in partnership with Banco Itaucard S.A.. Our current TudoAzul partners
include American Express, Banco do Brasil, Banco Itaú, Bradesco, Banco
Santander, Caixa, HSBC, among numerous others. In addition, we believe that the
introduction of international flights to our network will provide our TudoAzul
members with a broader range of more compelling and attractive redemption
options. To maximize the value creation potential of TudoAzul going forward, we
have recently started to manage the program as a separate business unit. On a
standalone basis, TudoAzul’s sale of points to third parties totaled R$244
million during the last twelve months ended September 30, 2014. Given the number
of exclusive destinations we operate, our network strength, and the projected
growth of passenger air travel in Brazil, we believe that TudoAzul will help
increase operating revenues for our primary passenger travel business.

Our hub-and-spoke network is an integral part of our model of stimulating demand
since it allows us to consolidate traffic by serving larger and medium-sized
markets (including every state capital in Brazil) as well as smaller cities that
do not generate sufficient demand for point-to-point service. As of September 
30, 2014, 53.5% of our passengers at Campinas airport were in transit to 
another destination and 28.9% of all of our customers at the same period were 
connecting to other destinations through our network. We believe our main 
competitors, who only fly larger aircraft, are unable to generate sufficient 
demand to serve most of our markets profitably. As a result of our 
differentiated business strategy, we were the sole airline in 39 of the 
destinations we serve and on 64.9% of our routes as of September 30, 2014.

Our main hubs are located in Campinas and Belo Horizonte, two of the largest
metropolitan areas in the country. Campinas is one of the wealthiest cities in
Brazil according to IBGE, located approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles) from
the city of São Paulo and has a catchment area of approximately seven million
people in a 100km radius, according to IBGE. We are the leading airline at
Campinas, with a 90.8% share of the airport’s 183 daily departures as of
September 30, 2014. As a result of heightened demand driven by our entry into
Campinas, as of September 30, 2014, the Campinas airport served 53 destinations,
the most non-stop domestic flights of any Brazilian airport. Our second largest
hub is located at the main airport of Belo Horizonte, capital of the third
wealthiest state in Brazil according to IBGE, where we currently serve 30
destinations and have a 47.3% share of the airport’s 151 daily departures as of
September 30, 2014. In addition, we are the fastest growing airline at Guarulhos
airport, the largest airport in Brazil located near São Paulo, representing
62.2% of the airport’s growth in terms of domestic departures for the 12 months
ended September 30, 2014. As of September 30, 2014, we offered 51 daily flights
to 14 destinations from Guarulhos airport. Other smaller hubs that contribute to
the increased connectivity of our network include Porto Alegre, Curitiba,
Cuiabá, and Manaus.

Brazil, which is geographically similar in size to the continental United
States, is the third largest market for domestic passengers after the United
States and China, and is expected to reach 122.4 million domestic passengers by
2017, an increase of 32 million passengers compared to 90 million in 2013,
according to Innovata data. We believe Brazil continues to show significant
growth potential as air travel is still significantly underpenetrated, with 0.4
average flight segments flown per person per year, compared to 2.6 in a mature
market such as the United States in 2012.

The core of our strategy is to drive greater profitability by growing our
network on a domestic and international basis, adding new destinations, further
interconnecting our current destinations, and increasing frequency in existing
markets. We believe this continued roll-out will stimulate further demand,
reducing CASK and increasing margins through the economies of scale created by
optimizing our resources and staff. We also intend to continue growing our 
ancillary revenue streams, which represented R$30.7 per passenger in the nine 
months ended September 30, 2014, including cargo operations and travel packages,
by leveraging our existing products and expanding our offerings.
