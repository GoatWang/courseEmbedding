Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

When fleas, ticks and mosquitoes bite your dog, they can cause irritation and transmit deadly diseases. But not all products work the same.K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks AND mosquitoes through contact. No biting required. Now that's a wise choice.

									No biting required.
								
Veterinarian-recommended K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice, and repels biting flies. And because it works through contact, there’s no biting required.

K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.

We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.

Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

K9 Advantix® II FAQs




I have never had a flea problem before. Where are my pets picking up fleas?


Fleas are very hardy pests that are quite capable of hitching rides on a variety of mammals. Wild animals or feral pets traveling through the environment may be a source for a pet’s exposure.
Fleas may be brought to the house by:

You – attached to clothing, luggage, dog blankets, etc.
Your pet – any time your pet steps outside your house, they are potentially exposed to fleas, especially in areas where there are other animals.
Stray or homeless cats and dogs – since these animals are not being cared for, they are easy targets for fleas. A single feral cat walking through your back yard even just one time may drop many flea eggs into the grass or under shrubs.
Wildlife – particularly raccoons and opossums. These animals typically aren’t seen very often, because they are active at night. A single opossum can carry as many as 1,000 adult fleas! An opossum walking through your back yard even just one time can drop many flea eggs into the grass or under shrubs as they pass through.
Non-treated pets in the household – most dogs are treated for fleas and ticks. Often, the cats in the household are not, especially if they are indoor only cats.  
Non-treated pets in the neighborhood – you may be vigilant about treating your pets for fleas, but your neighbor(s) may not. 






How long after using another topical product do I need to wait before applying K9 Advantix&reg II?


We at Bayer have not studied the concurrent use of the wide variety of other products on the market. Please consult your dog’s veterinarian for their recommendation.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How long after using K9 Advantix&reg II do I need to wait before applying a different Bayer topical product?


Please consult your dog’s veterinarian for their recommendation.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





What are the benefits of K9 Advantix&reg II?


K9 Advantix® II provides comprehensive protection against fleas, ticks and mosquitoes.
Get all these benefits in every tube of K9 Advantix® II:

Kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. No biting required!
Kills all life stages of fleas
Starts killing ticks within 10 minutes*
	*Three days post-treatment on previously non-treated dogs1

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.

1. Data on file.





How long does K9 Advantix&reg II last?


A single application of K9 Advantix® II keeps working for a month.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





My dog is strictly indoors. Should I still use K9 Advantix&reg II?


Yes. Even dogs that spend the majority of their time indoors should be treated with K9 Advantix® II because fleas and ticks can be brought into the home by people or other pets without pet owners even realizing it. In fact, the saliva of most ticks has substances that can prevent their hosts from recognizing they have attached.1
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.
1. Ribeiro JM, Makoul GT, Levine J, et al. (1985). Antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive properties of the saliva of a tick, Ixodes dammini. J Exp Med. 161(2):332-344.





I only see fleas on one of my dogs. Is it sufficient to just treat the infested dog?


No. Fleas can jump up to 18.5 inches forward and 6.5 inches high,3 so all dogs in the home should be treated, since the infested dog is likely to pass on fleas to other dogs he is in contact with.
 
3. Cadiergues MC, Joubert C, Franc M. (2000). A comparison of jump performances of the dog flea, Ctenocephalides canis (Curtis, 1829) and the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouche, 1835). Vet Parasitol. 92(3):239-241.





Can I use K9 Advantix&reg II on my cat?



No. K9 Advantix® II is specifically formulated for dogs. Cats have a unique physiology and can’t efficiently metabolize certain products, including K9 Advantix® II.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.






Can I use K9 Advantix&reg II if my dog is on medication?


Please consult your dog’s veterinarian to discuss appropriate products to use in conjunction with any other medications your dog may be taking.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How do I store and dispose of K9 Advantix&reg II?

Disposal and Container Handling: Nonrefillable container. If empty: Do not reuse this container. Place in trash or offer for recycling, if available. If partly filled: Call your local solid waste agency for disposal instructions. Never place unused product down any indoor or outdoor drain.

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.

No. Follow label directions for the application of K9 Advantix® II. If the label directions fail to answer your questions, please consult your dog’s veterinarian.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





What is the expiration date for K9 Advantix&reg II?

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





When can I bathe my dog after application of K9 Advantix&reg II?

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How long after bathing my dog do I need to wait to apply K9 Advantix&reg II?


Apply K9 Advantix® II after your dog has been towel dried.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





When using K9 Advantix&reg II, what type of shampoo should I use? 


We suggest using non-stripping shampoos that are specifically designed for use on dogs. Non-stripping shampoos are generally soap-free formulations designed for general cleansing.
We do NOT recommend the use of either medicated shampoos (commonly used as treatment of various skin conditions) or insecticidal shampoos for general bathing or cleansing purposes. We also do NOT recommend the use of shampoos used for humans.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How often can I bathe my dog when using K9 Advantix&reg II?


We recommend bathing BEFORE applying monthly product. The product can be applied once the dog is towel dried.
We suggest using non-stripping shampoos that are specifically designed for use on dogs. Non-stripping shampoos are generally soap-free formulations designed for general cleansing.

Do fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes have to bite my dog in order for K9 Advantix&reg II to work?


Not all products work the same, K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. No biting required!





Does K9 Advantix&reg II cover more than fleas and ticks?


Yes, fleas and ticks are just scratching the surface! K9 Advantix® II also kills mosquitoes, unlike most products at your veterinarian's office. In addition, you won't find mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package.
As if that isn't enough, K9 Advantix® II also repels biting flies and kills chewing lice.





What is the difference between K9 Advantix&reg II and oral flea and tick products?


K9 Advantix® II is topically applied to your dog's skin and kills fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes through contact, no biting required! With oral flea and tick medications, fleas and ticks have to bite your dog and be exposed to the medication in your dog's blood before they are killed.





Can I apply K9 Advantix&reg II more than once a month?


A single application of K9 Advantix® II remains effective for four weeks. However in cases of severe infestation, retreatment is possible every 7 days. After pest control is attained, return to a monthly retreatment schedule.





How old does my dog need to be for me to use K9 Advantix&reg II?


K9 Advantix® II can be used on dogs as young as 7 weeks of age.





Why am I seeing fleas after applying K9 Advantix&reg II to my dog?


Although K9 Advantix® II kills fleas on your dog, there may still be fleas in your dog's environment that jump on after treatment. Luckily, with K9 Advantix® II, new fleas are killed within 2 hours with protection against further infestation for at least 4 weeks. As fleas die they are no longer able to stay hidden against your dog's skin, and therefore you may also be seeing dying fleas coming to the surface of your dog's fur coat.





How long does it take for K9 Advantix&reg II to kill ticks?


K9 Advantix® II starts killing ticks within 10 minutes.*
*Three days post-treatment on previously non-treated dogs1.
1Data on file, Bayer Animal Health





How long does it take for K9 Advantix&reg II to kill fleas?

How to Apply




How to Apply

View transcript 
The bond between you and your dog is incredibly loving and loyal. He wants to protect you and you feel the same. That’s why Bayer Animal Health recommends the use of flea or tick prevention products year-round.
Before applying a Bayer topical product, check the weight range and minimum age on the package to select the appropriate product for your dog.
Monthly application is easy. Remove the tube. Hold the tube in an upright position and away from your face. Open the tube by pulling off the cap, turning it around, and placing the other end of the cap on the tube. Twist the cap to break the seal, and remove the cap from the tube.
For easy application, your dog should be standing. Next, starting at your dog’s shoulder blades, part the hair until skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin, and gently squeeze to expel a portion of the solution on the skin.
The number of application spots depends on the size and weight of your dog.
Weight bands are indicated in your complete instructions on the package insert. Be sure to empty the entire tube by the end of the application. Do not apply an excessive amount of solution to any one spot that could cause some of the solution to run off the side of your dog.
Lift the tube away from the skin, while maintaining pressure on the tube to make sure the product has all been squeezed out.
(Sign up for monthly application email reminders, Pet-Basics-dot-com.)

									No biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

AdvanSix - Starting 2017 Strong, Add On Dips - AdvanSix Inc. (NYSE:ASIX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AdvanSix - Starting 2017 Strong, Add On DipsMay.12.17 | About: AdvanSix Inc. (ASIX) The Value Investor Long/short equity, special situations, valueMarketplaceValue In Corporate EventsSummaryAdvanSix is off to a great start in 2017.Cash flow conversion continues to be problematic, but the situation is improving.Appealing multiples, low leverage ratios and improving cash flow conversion continue to make shares worthwhile to add on dips.AdvanSix (ASIX) started 2017 on a very strong note. I have already looked at the prospects for the spin-off from Honeywell (HON) on multiple occasions in the recent past. In general, I like AdvanSix as an operator as valuation multiples are modest, especially given the relative soft point in the cycle at which the business operated in recent quarters. These low multiples make shares look very appealing, offset by the fact that cash flow conversion was very poor, with capital spending outpacing depreciation charges by a substantial amount, despite a lack of growth. Instead, AdvanSix had to invest heavily to meet (environmental) requirements, among others. Shares have quickly risen from levels around $15 at the time of the spin-off in the fall of 2016, to trade in a $25-30 range in recent months. I had hoped that poor Q4 results (driven by large maintenance charges) would have provided a buying opportunity, but fortunately this has not materialized. A "Commodity-Like" Business AdvanSix produces products like ammonium sulfates, nylon and chemical intermediates which are in essence commodity-like businesses, although input and selling prices are very closely correlated. Nylon is the key product, responsible for half of sales, as the remainder of sales is split up across the other two product groups. Notably, the non-nylon markets are quite cyclical with regards to pricing, with cumene (which derives its price from crude) being a key input. Given the plunge in crude prices, which has hurt both input and selling prices, sales have come under a great deal of pressure over the past two years, as this has hurt margins as well. Of course the situation has stabilized at this point in time, as crude is now hovering around the $50 mark. If you are operating in a commodity-like business, a key proponent of the performance is not in your control. Therefore, management focuses on what it can control, which is operating a tightly integrated business and delivering on operational excellence, as the company benefits from access to relative cheap US natural gas as well.
 Off To A Strong Start After declining crude prices resulted in sales falling from $1.8 billion in 2013 to $1.2 billion in 2016, AdvanSix is off to a strong start this year. First-quarter revenues rose by more than 25% to $376.7 million, mostly driven by higher prices. Pass-through pricing rose by 19%, market-based pricing was up 3% and volumes rose by 4%. The company was pleased with the generally tighter market conditions, supporting this growth. Notably nylon was very strong, as the company benefits from a recovery in North American construction. Nylon is most commonly used to fabricate carpets. The company posted an EBITDA number of $57.1 million, being equal to 15.2% of sales. This was up just modestly compared to the previous year as last year's number was inflated by a one-time benefit. Adjusted for that benefit, EBITDA rose by 51% as margins improved by 260 basis points. The company posted a net profit number of $27.3 million, equivalent to $0.88 per share. The company continues to project relatively reasonable conditions for the rest of the year, although Nylon pricing might become more challenged in H2. If we assume that this quarter might be representative for the rest of the year, the full year EBITDA number might come in around $225 million. Holding $12 million in cash, operating with $265 million in debt, leverage ratios stand at 1.1 times EBITDA. This number increases to 1.3 times if pension-related liabilities are included in the leverage calculation as well. Note that EBITDA of >$200 million is approaching the 2013 levels, as EBITDA numbers have fluctuated in a $100-200 million range in the period 2014-2016. If the $27 million earnings number can be annualized as well, earnings of $110 million might be within reach. This translates into a healthy earnings number of $3.50 per share for a mere 8 times earnings multiple. The reason why current earnings multiples are so low is the fact that cash flow conversion is very poor. Depreciation charges now run at roughly $45 million a year, as the company guides that capital spending is seen around $90 million this year. That suggests that the company generates free cash flow of $65 million this year, which means that fee cash flow comes in at little over $2 per share for a 14 times multiple.
 The good news is that capital spending already came in at $33 million in Q1, as capital spending is seen at $57 million in the remaining three quarters of the year, although it remains a headache for investors. Another near-term headwind are pension contributions which are seen at $20 million this year, versus a normalized expense of $7-10 million. A Quick Note On Capex And Replacement Values On the conference call, management made an interesting observation. PP&E is valued at little less than $600 million on the balance sheet while the current replacement value comes in at $3 billion. The company guides for 2% capital spending in relation to this replacement value in a normalized environment, translating into annual capital spending of $55-65 million which means that cash flow conversion will continue to improve going forwards. If that replacement valuation is realistic, shareholder equity per share comes closer to $80 per share! While these legacy assets might be very much undervalued on the company's books, it comes at a cost as well. The company does face outages which require frequent maintenance and upgrades. Notably, unexpected outages can be costly in terms of reliability, service to customers and the costs of emergency fixes. With depreciation charges gradually rising to $50 million in 2018, free cash flow generation on the back of the current environment really comes in close to $3 as a very modest leverage ratio and 10% cash flow yield make shares look very appealing, even if conditions are not even red-hot yet at this point in time. Adding On Dips AdvanSix started the year on a stronger foot than I had been expecting, as I anticipated earnings of close to $2.50 per share for 2017 when the company released its results for 2016. After a $0.88 per share number in Q1, it seems relatively safe to say that this target will be achieved, unless major unplanned outages take place in the rest of the year or pricing will be very soft. I note that capital spending still runs at 200% of depreciation charges this year, as free cash flow of $65 million equals just 60% of projected earnings of $110 million. The good news is that much of the capital spending has already taken place in Q1, as the conversion will improve towards 70% in the rest of the year.
 With leverage coming down rapidly, the gap between depreciation & capital spending is narrowing in a rather rapid fashion. While volumes are solid and multiples continue to be quite compelling, I continue to be attracted to the stock. Having not hit the buy button when shares hit a low of $25 in April, I am now (again) left out at $29. Amidst the continued improving operations, I remain a buyer if shares retreat to $25-26 per share.

Does your flea and tick product require a bite?

When fleas, ticks and mosquitoes bite your dog, they can cause irritation and transmit deadly diseases. But not all products work the same.K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks AND mosquitoes through contact. No biting required. Now that's a wise choice.

									No biting required.
								
Veterinarian-recommended K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks, mosquitoes and lice, and repels biting flies. And because it works through contact, there’s no biting required.

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS








































The more you know, the better. For both you and your dog.

We're proud to partner with K9s For Warriors.



Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious issue. An estimated 22 veterans take their own lives every day. That's why K9 Advantix® II has been a longstanding supporter of K9s For Warriors, donating more than $700,000 since 2014.This amazing organization pairs specially trained shelter dogs with military veterans suffering from PTSD or traumatic brain injury.The program has already helped save hundreds of shelter dogs and veterans. 73% of program graduates report improved health and 92% have reduced or eliminated their dependence on medication.

K9 Advantix® II FAQs




I have never had a flea problem before. Where are my pets picking up fleas?


Fleas are very hardy pests that are quite capable of hitching rides on a variety of mammals. Wild animals or feral pets traveling through the environment may be a source for a pet’s exposure.
Fleas may be brought to the house by:

You – attached to clothing, luggage, dog blankets, etc.
Your pet – any time your pet steps outside your house, they are potentially exposed to fleas, especially in areas where there are other animals.
Stray or homeless cats and dogs – since these animals are not being cared for, they are easy targets for fleas. A single feral cat walking through your back yard even just one time may drop many flea eggs into the grass or under shrubs.
Wildlife – particularly raccoons and opossums. These animals typically aren’t seen very often, because they are active at night. A single opossum can carry as many as 1,000 adult fleas! An opossum walking through your back yard even just one time can drop many flea eggs into the grass or under shrubs as they pass through.
Non-treated pets in the household – most dogs are treated for fleas and ticks. Often, the cats in the household are not, especially if they are indoor only cats.  
Non-treated pets in the neighborhood – you may be vigilant about treating your pets for fleas, but your neighbor(s) may not. 






How long after using another topical product do I need to wait before applying K9 Advantix&reg II?


We at Bayer have not studied the concurrent use of the wide variety of other products on the market. Please consult your dog’s veterinarian for their recommendation.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How long after using K9 Advantix&reg II do I need to wait before applying a different Bayer topical product?


Please consult your dog’s veterinarian for their recommendation.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





What are the benefits of K9 Advantix&reg II?


K9 Advantix® II provides comprehensive protection against fleas, ticks and mosquitoes.
Get all these benefits in every tube of K9 Advantix® II:

Kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. No biting required!
Kills all life stages of fleas
Starts killing ticks within 10 minutes*
	*Three days post-treatment on previously non-treated dogs1
Kills mosquitoes through contact, often before they have a chance to bite
Repels biting flies
Kills chewing lice


Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.

1. Data on file.





How long does K9 Advantix&reg II last?


A single application of K9 Advantix® II keeps working for a month.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





My dog is strictly indoors. Should I still use K9 Advantix&reg II?


Yes. Even dogs that spend the majority of their time indoors should be treated with K9 Advantix® II because fleas and ticks can be brought into the home by people or other pets without pet owners even realizing it. In fact, the saliva of most ticks has substances that can prevent their hosts from recognizing they have attached.1
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.
1. Ribeiro JM, Makoul GT, Levine J, et al. (1985). Antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive properties of the saliva of a tick, Ixodes dammini. J Exp Med. 161(2):332-344.





I only see fleas on one of my dogs. Is it sufficient to just treat the infested dog?


No. Fleas can jump up to 18.5 inches forward and 6.5 inches high,3 so all dogs in the home should be treated, since the infested dog is likely to pass on fleas to other dogs he is in contact with.
 
3. Cadiergues MC, Joubert C, Franc M. (2000). A comparison of jump performances of the dog flea, Ctenocephalides canis (Curtis, 1829) and the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis felis (Bouche, 1835). Vet Parasitol. 92(3):239-241.





Can I use K9 Advantix&reg II on my cat?



No. K9 Advantix® II is specifically formulated for dogs. Cats have a unique physiology and can’t efficiently metabolize certain products, including K9 Advantix® II.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.






Can I use K9 Advantix&reg II if my dog is on medication?


Please consult your dog’s veterinarian to discuss appropriate products to use in conjunction with any other medications your dog may be taking.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How do I store and dispose of K9 Advantix&reg II?

Storage: Store in a cool, dry place. Protect from freezing. Keep out of reach of children.
Disposal and Container Handling: Nonrefillable container. If empty: Do not reuse this container. Place in trash or offer for recycling, if available. If partly filled: Call your local solid waste agency for disposal instructions. Never place unused product down any indoor or outdoor drain.

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





Can I split tubes of K9 Advantix&reg II between my dogs?


No. Follow label directions for the application of K9 Advantix® II. If the label directions fail to answer your questions, please consult your dog’s veterinarian.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





What is the expiration date for K9 Advantix&reg II?

How often can I allow my dog to swim when using K9 Advantix&reg II?


We recommend letting your dog swim no more than once a month.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





When can I bathe my dog after application of K9 Advantix&reg II?


We recommend bathing BEFORE applying product. The product can be applied once the dog is towel dried. If a bath is necessary between applications, we recommend waiting at least 4 days after applying the product. Please use a non-stripping, pet shampoo.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How long after bathing my dog do I need to wait to apply K9 Advantix&reg II?


Apply K9 Advantix® II after your dog has been towel dried.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





When using K9 Advantix&reg II, what type of shampoo should I use? 


We suggest using non-stripping shampoos that are specifically designed for use on dogs. Non-stripping shampoos are generally soap-free formulations designed for general cleansing.
We do NOT recommend the use of either medicated shampoos (commonly used as treatment of various skin conditions) or insecticidal shampoos for general bathing or cleansing purposes. We also do NOT recommend the use of shampoos used for humans.
Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





How often can I bathe my dog when using K9 Advantix&reg II?


We recommend bathing BEFORE applying monthly product. The product can be applied once the dog is towel dried.
We suggest using non-stripping shampoos that are specifically designed for use on dogs. Non-stripping shampoos are generally soap-free formulations designed for general cleansing.

Do not use K9 Advantix® II on cats.





Do fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes have to bite my dog in order for K9 Advantix&reg II to work?


Not all products work the same, K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. No biting required!





Does K9 Advantix&reg II cover more than fleas and ticks?


Yes, fleas and ticks are just scratching the surface! K9 Advantix® II also kills mosquitoes, unlike most products at your veterinarian's office. In addition, you won't find mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package.
As if that isn't enough, K9 Advantix® II also repels biting flies and kills chewing lice.





What is the difference between K9 Advantix&reg II and oral flea and tick products?


K9 Advantix® II is topically applied to your dog's skin and kills fleas, ticks, and mosquitoes through contact, no biting required! With oral flea and tick medications, fleas and ticks have to bite your dog and be exposed to the medication in your dog's blood before they are killed.





Can I apply K9 Advantix&reg II more than once a month?


A single application of K9 Advantix® II remains effective for four weeks. However in cases of severe infestation, retreatment is possible every 7 days. After pest control is attained, return to a monthly retreatment schedule.





How old does my dog need to be for me to use K9 Advantix&reg II?


K9 Advantix® II can be used on dogs as young as 7 weeks of age.





Why am I seeing fleas after applying K9 Advantix&reg II to my dog?


Although K9 Advantix® II kills fleas on your dog, there may still be fleas in your dog's environment that jump on after treatment. Luckily, with K9 Advantix® II, new fleas are killed within 2 hours with protection against further infestation for at least 4 weeks. As fleas die they are no longer able to stay hidden against your dog's skin, and therefore you may also be seeing dying fleas coming to the surface of your dog's fur coat.





How long does it take for K9 Advantix&reg II to kill ticks?


K9 Advantix® II starts killing ticks within 10 minutes.*
*Three days post-treatment on previously non-treated dogs1.
1Data on file, Bayer Animal Health





How long does it take for K9 Advantix&reg II to kill fleas?


K9 Advantix® II kills fleas within 12 hours. New fleas are killed within 2 hours with protection against further infestation for at least 4 weeks.






How to Apply




How to Apply

View transcript 
The bond between you and your dog is incredibly loving and loyal. He wants to protect you and you feel the same. That’s why Bayer Animal Health recommends the use of flea or tick prevention products year-round.
Before applying a Bayer topical product, check the weight range and minimum age on the package to select the appropriate product for your dog.
Monthly application is easy. Remove the tube. Hold the tube in an upright position and away from your face. Open the tube by pulling off the cap, turning it around, and placing the other end of the cap on the tube. Twist the cap to break the seal, and remove the cap from the tube.
For easy application, your dog should be standing. Next, starting at your dog’s shoulder blades, part the hair until skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin, and gently squeeze to expel a portion of the solution on the skin.
The number of application spots depends on the size and weight of your dog.
Weight bands are indicated in your complete instructions on the package insert. Be sure to empty the entire tube by the end of the application. Do not apply an excessive amount of solution to any one spot that could cause some of the solution to run off the side of your dog.
Lift the tube away from the skin, while maintaining pressure on the tube to make sure the product has all been squeezed out.
(Sign up for monthly application email reminders, Pet-Basics-dot-com.)

Application & Safety Information

 
















K9 Advantix® II kills through contact, no biting required.













Remember, bites are just the beginning.



Obviously, bites from fleas, ticks and mosquitoes can be very painful to your dog. Worse, those bites may expose your pet to irritation, itching and even deadly diseases. K9 Advantix® II kills those harmful fleas, ticks and mosquitoes through contact. So they don’t have to bite to die. No wonder veterinarians recommend K9 Advantix® II. So why use anything else?SEE PRODUCT DETAILSDo not use on cats.


















Not all flea and tick treatments for dogs work the same.



When it comes to mosquito prevention, Frontline Plus can’t compare to K9 Advantix® II. You won’t find any mention of mosquitoes anywhere on the Frontline Plus package. Even most flea and tick products at your veterinarian don’t kill mosquitoes. And because mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases to your dog, why not kill them while also killing fleas and ticks?What about chewable flea and tick products? They may seem more convenient, but what if we told you that chewable products don’t kill fleas and ticks unless they bite your dog? In other words, fleas and ticks have to bite to die. And no chewable flea and tick product kills mosquitoes.SEE PRODUCT DETAILS

Comprehensive flea, tick and mosquito protection for your dog.



Fleas, ticks and mosquitoes must hate K9 Advantix® II. And why wouldn’t they? K9 Advantix® II kills fleas, ticks and mosquitoes on dogs through contact, and they don’t have to bite your dog to die. 
Because fleas, ticks and mosquitoes don’t just bite:Fleas can cause flea allergy dermatitis (FAD), an allergic reaction that can lead to constant scratching, severe itching and hair loss. FAD is one of the most common reasons pet owners take their dogs to the veterinarian. If swallowed, an infected flea can also transmit tapeworms, one of the most common intestinal parasites.Ticks can transmit deadly diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.Mosquitoes can transmit deadly diseases, too, including heartworm. Other products may kill fleas and ticks, but that’s just scratching the surface.
And if your dog enjoys a weekly dip, K9 Advantix® II is still a wise choice because it’s waterproof.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

Instructions


How to open:

Be sure tube is at bottom of pouch.
Using scissors, cut the pouch across the top and remove tube.

How to apply:

Use only on dogs.
Remove applicator tube from the package. Use scissors and peel down foil.
Hold applicator tube in an upright position. Pull cap off tube.
Turn the cap around and place other end of cap back on tube.
Twist cap to break seal, then remove cap from tube.
The dog should be standing for easy application. The entire contents of the K9 Advantix II tube should be applied evenly on the top of the back from the shoulder to the base of the tail. At each spot, part the hair until the skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin and gently squeeze to expel a portion of the solution on the skin. Do not apply an excessive amount of solution at any one spot that could cause some of the solution to run off the side of the dog.
Discard empty tube.
In cases of severe pest infestations, retreatment is allowable earlier than 4 weeks. Do not retreat more often than once every 7 days. After pest control is attained, return to a monthly retreatment schedule.

Frequently Asked Questions
How is K9 Advantix II different from K9 Advantix?
With the addition of an insect growth regulator (IGR), K9 Advantix II kills all life stages of fleas. K9 Advantix II also prevents development of fleas, flea eggs, larvae (maggots), and pupae (cocoons), and prevents fleas on a treated dog from infesting your home.
What is the benefit of repellency?
Repellency helps prevent ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes from attaching, biting or feeding. A repelled parasite doesn’t bite or attach. If it doesn’t bite or attach, it can’t transmit the organisms that may cause disease.
What is the difference between K9 Advantix II and other tick and flea products?
K9 Advantix II repels and kills ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. It repels biting flies and kills lice, too. Its repellency activity and broad spectrum make K9 Advantix II different from other tick and flea products.
Is K9 Advantix II waterproof?
Yes. There is no need to reapply the product after weekly swimming or a bath. For best results, use a non-detergent shampoo.
Can I use K9 Advantix II on my cat?
No. K9 Advantix II must not be used on cats because of a cat’s unique physiology and inability to metabolize certain compounds.

I started with Advantage when I lived in the city and it worked great, no fleas, but I also didn't have problems with ticks in the yard. I moved to a rural setting where the dogs have land to run with trees around the perimeter. Ticks are a problem! My dogs are inside dogs that only go out with their humans. I changed to Frontline with no success. Ticks attached and were still alive when I removed them. Also had trouble with ticks in the house and getting on me. The Advantix had reduced the number of ticks on the dogs and I haven't noticed any ticks in the house. But I still have to pull off ticks when we come back in the house and those ticks are still kind of alive. I believe they would soon

It is the best so far and I will continue to use it. My pups have sensitive tummies and I do not want to try any of the oral chews.

I've been using Advantix on my dog her whole life.  I live in an area that's known for "horse properties" so we end up with a lot of horse flies.  Our previous dog (Advantix wasn't around yet) used to end up with fly bites on the tips of her ears.  As far as I know, this is the only flea/tick repellent that also repels flies.  Sure enough, never had a problem with fly bites on this dog.  A few years ago was the first time we had to pull two or three ticks off of her.  I called the manufacturer and was told that since it was a bad year/season for ticks, it's possibly for some to still bite.  But, since that year we haven't found any other ones on her.

Great product! We have used this for three dogs and have never had a flea issue. Seems to work well for ticks too! Would recommend this product to friends! And it is more convenient to order through these guys than going to the vet...will continue to be a customer......................................................................................................................

I have an outside dog and we live in louisiana so theres a lot of misquitoes, nats, flies, and ticks. He started to get bumps all over his skin and he was itching real bad you could just tell he was miserable so i got him this medicine and it automatically started working and hes so much happier now!























                                works well

Love chewy.com great customer service!!

Works great very good. No bugs on my pups!!!!!!!! Much better than others I've tried prior. I will only use a topical product..., If there's a reaction, you can bathe many times and save the life of your pet, while edibles are much harder to stop the allergic reaction

This has kept my 2 60lb + Boxer/Pits (who are skin allergy prone) and 1 terrier mix flea free for 11 months! Living in the Midwest comes with humid/rainy weather where the fleas love to run rampant! After trying 3 brands I finally came upon this brand. I haven't looked back since.  I'm able to give them baths after 2 days to get rid of the greasy hair with the product still being effective. Thank you to Chewy for offering so many options for tick and flea relief.

I did use another product years ago and was unaware that the formula had been changed.  Our GSD and all 3 indoor cats got not only fleas but tape worms as well.  It was a nightmare!  K9 A II is the only thing I'll use.  I tried briefly the Trifexis but the dog refused to eat it and it required a separate tick collar that had to be worn a week before going out into the field.  No, no, no.  Back to K9 A II to stay. Good luck with the rest.  By the way, we live in the Pacific Northwest forest.

I recently purchased PetArmor Plus and it only worked for three days at the most. I gave K9 Advantix II to my dog two days ago and YES! Not a single flea and mosquitoes even stay away! I love this stuff!

The flea season came on with a vengeance and so being the mom of 5 German Shepherds who go out and play and come in we gave this a try and are Ecstatic about the results. Haven't seen any scratching or visable fleas on my babies. I would definitely recommend to others who want the protection for their furry children. Thanks Chewy for another super product at a great price !!

Instructions


How to open:

Be sure tube is at bottom of pouch.
Using scissors, cut the pouch across the top and remove tube.

How to apply:

Use only on dogs.
Remove applicator tube from the package. Use scissors and peel down foil.
Hold applicator tube in an upright position. Pull cap off tube.
Turn the cap around and place other end of cap back on tube.
Twist cap to break seal, then remove cap from tube.
The dog should be standing for easy application. The entire contents of the K9 Advantix II tube should be applied evenly on the top of the back from the shoulder to the base of the tail. At each spot, part the hair until the skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin and gently squeeze to expel a portion of the solution on the skin. Do not apply an excessive amount of solution at any one spot that could cause some of the solution to run off the side of the dog.
Discard empty tube.
In cases of severe pest infestations, retreatment is allowable earlier than 4 weeks. Do not retreat more often than once every 7 days. After pest control is attained, return to a monthly retreatment schedule.

Frequently Asked Questions
How is K9 Advantix II different from K9 Advantix?
With the addition of an insect growth regulator (IGR), K9 Advantix II kills all life stages of fleas. K9 Advantix II also prevents development of fleas, flea eggs, larvae (maggots), and pupae (cocoons), and prevents fleas on a treated dog from infesting your home.
What is the benefit of repellency?
Repellency helps prevent ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes from attaching, biting or feeding. A repelled parasite doesn’t bite or attach. If it doesn’t bite or attach, it can’t transmit the organisms that may cause disease.
What is the difference between K9 Advantix II and other tick and flea products?
K9 Advantix II repels and kills ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. It repels biting flies and kills lice, too. Its repellency activity and broad spectrum make K9 Advantix II different from other tick and flea products.
Is K9 Advantix II waterproof?
Yes. There is no need to reapply the product after weekly swimming or a bath. For best results, use a non-detergent shampoo.
Can I use K9 Advantix II on my cat?
No. K9 Advantix II must not be used on cats because of a cat’s unique physiology and inability to metabolize certain compounds.

I started with Advantage when I lived in the city and it worked great, no fleas, but I also didn't have problems with ticks in the yard. I moved to a rural setting where the dogs have land to run with trees around the perimeter. Ticks are a problem! My dogs are inside dogs that only go out with their humans. I changed to Frontline with no success. Ticks attached and were still alive when I removed them. Also had trouble with ticks in the house and getting on me. The Advantix had reduced the number of ticks on the dogs and I haven't noticed any ticks in the house. But I still have to pull off ticks when we come back in the house and those ticks are still kind of alive. I believe they would soon

It is the best so far and I will continue to use it. My pups have sensitive tummies and I do not want to try any of the oral chews.

I've been using Advantix on my dog her whole life.  I live in an area that's known for "horse properties" so we end up with a lot of horse flies.  Our previous dog (Advantix wasn't around yet) used to end up with fly bites on the tips of her ears.  As far as I know, this is the only flea/tick repellent that also repels flies.  Sure enough, never had a problem with fly bites on this dog.  A few years ago was the first time we had to pull two or three ticks off of her.  I called the manufacturer and was told that since it was a bad year/season for ticks, it's possibly for some to still bite.  But, since that year we haven't found any other ones on her.

Instructions


How to open:

Be sure tube is at bottom of pouch.
Using scissors, cut the pouch across the top and remove tube.

How to apply:

Use only on dogs.
Remove applicator tube from the package. Use scissors and peel down foil.
Hold applicator tube in an upright position. Pull cap off tube.
Turn the cap around and place other end of cap back on tube.
Twist cap to break seal, then remove cap from tube.
The dog should be standing for easy application. The entire contents of the K9 Advantix II tube should be applied evenly on the top of the back from the shoulder to the base of the tail. At each spot, part the hair until the skin is visible. Place the tip of the tube on the skin and gently squeeze to expel a portion of the solution on the skin.

Frequently Asked Questions
How is K9 Advantix II different from K9 Advantix?
With the addition of an insect growth regulator (IGR), K9 Advantix II kills all life stages of fleas. K9 Advantix II also prevents development of fleas, flea eggs, larvae (maggots), and pupae (cocoons), and prevents fleas on a treated dog from infesting your home.
What is the benefit of repellency?
Repellency helps prevent ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes from attaching, biting or feeding. A repelled parasite doesn’t bite or attach. If it doesn’t bite or attach, it can’t transmit the organisms that may cause disease.
What is the difference between K9 Advantix II and other tick and flea products?
K9 Advantix II repels and kills ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes. It repels biting flies and kills lice, too. Its repellency activity and broad spectrum make K9 Advantix II different from other tick and flea products.
Is K9 Advantix II waterproof?
Yes. There is no need to reapply the product after weekly swimming or a bath. For best results, use a non-detergent shampoo.
Can I use K9 Advantix II on my cat?
No. K9 Advantix II must not be used on cats because of a cat’s unique physiology and inability to metabolize certain compounds.

I started with Advantage when I lived in the city and it worked great, no fleas, but I also didn't have problems with ticks in the yard. I moved to a rural setting where the dogs have land to run with trees around the perimeter. Ticks are a problem! My dogs are inside dogs that only go out with their humans. I changed to Frontline with no success. Ticks attached and were still alive when I removed them. Also had trouble with ticks in the house and getting on me. The Advantix had reduced the number of ticks on the dogs and I haven't noticed any ticks in the house. But I still have to pull off ticks when we come back in the house and those ticks are still kind of alive. I believe they would soon

It is the best so far and I will continue to use it. My pups have sensitive tummies and I do not want to try any of the oral chews.

I've been using Advantix on my dog her whole life.  I live in an area that's known for "horse properties" so we end up with a lot of horse flies.  Our previous dog (Advantix wasn't around yet) used to end up with fly bites on the tips of her ears.  As far as I know, this is the only flea/tick repellent that also repels flies.  Sure enough, never had a problem with fly bites on this dog.  A few years ago was the first time we had to pull two or three ticks off of her.  I called the manufacturer and was told that since it was a bad year/season for ticks, it's possibly for some to still bite.  But, since that year we haven't found any other ones on her.

Great product! We have used this for three dogs and have never had a flea issue. Seems to work well for ticks too! Would recommend this product to friends! And it is more convenient to order through these guys than going to the vet...will continue to be a customer......................................................................................................................

I have an outside dog and we live in louisiana so theres a lot of misquitoes, nats, flies, and ticks. He started to get bumps all over his skin and he was itching real bad you could just tell he was miserable so i got him this medicine and it automatically started working and hes so much happier now!

Love chewy.com great customer service!! Received everything very fast and the prices are great the dog beds I bought from there there actually have memory foam in them and cost less than the egg crate stuff you find in stores. The people I spoke with on the phone were so nice ,thanks again :)

Works great very good. No bugs on my pups!!!!!!!! Much better than others I've tried prior. I will only use a topical product..., If there's a reaction, you can bathe many times and save the life of your pet, while edibles are much harder to stop the allergic reaction

This has kept my 2 60lb + Boxer/Pits (who are skin allergy prone) and 1 terrier mix flea free for 11 months! Living in the Midwest comes with humid/rainy weather where the fleas love to run rampant! After trying 3 brands I finally came upon this brand. I haven't looked back since.  I'm able to give them baths after 2 days to get rid of the greasy hair with the product still being effective. Thank you to Chewy for offering so many options for tick and flea relief.

















                                good stuff

I did use another product years ago and was unaware that the formula had been changed.  Our GSD and all 3 indoor cats got not only fleas but tape worms as well.  It was a nightmare!  K9 A II is the only thing I'll use.  I tried briefly the Trifexis but the dog refused to eat it and it required a separate tick collar that had to be worn a week before going out into the field.  No, no, no.  Back to K9 A II to stay. Good luck with the rest.  By the way, we live in the Pacific Northwest forest.

















                                The best so far!

I recently purchased PetArmor Plus and it only worked for three days at the most. I gave K9 Advantix II to my dog two days ago and YES! Not a single flea and mosquitoes even stay away! I love this stuff!

















                                Great Product!!!

The flea season came on with a vengeance and so being the mom of 5 German Shepherds who go out and play and come in we gave this a try and are Ecstatic about the results. Haven't seen any scratching or visable fleas on my babies. I would definitely recommend to others who want the protection for their furry children. Thanks Chewy for another super product at a great price !!

I started with Advantage when I lived in the city and it worked great, no fleas, but I also didn't have problems with ticks in the yard. I moved to a rural setting where the dogs have land to run with trees around the perimeter. Ticks are a problem! My dogs are inside dogs that only go out with their humans. I changed to Frontline with no success. Ticks attached and were still alive when I removed them. Also had trouble with ticks in the house and getting on me. The Advantix had reduced the number of ticks on the dogs and I haven't noticed any ticks in the house. But I still have to pull off ticks when we come back in the house and those ticks are still kind of alive. I believe they would soon

It is the best so far and I will continue to use it. My pups have sensitive tummies and I do not want to try any of the oral chews.

I've been using Advantix on my dog her whole life.  I live in an area that's known for "horse properties" so we end up with a lot of horse flies.  Our previous dog (Advantix wasn't around yet) used to end up with fly bites on the tips of her ears.  As far as I know, this is the only flea/tick repellent that also repels flies.  Sure enough, never had a problem with fly bites on this dog.  A few years ago was the first time we had to pull two or three ticks off of her.  I called the manufacturer and was told that since it was a bad year/season for ticks, it's possibly for some to still bite.  But, since that year we haven't found any other ones on her.

















                                Impressive!

Great product! We have used this for three dogs and have never had a flea issue. Seems to work well for ticks too! Would recommend this product to friends! And it is more convenient to order through these guys than going to the vet...will continue to be a customer......................................................................................................................

I have an outside dog and we live in louisiana so theres a lot of misquitoes, nats, flies, and ticks. He started to get bumps all over his skin and he was itching real bad you could just tell he was miserable so i got him this medicine and it automatically started working and hes so much happier now!























                                works well

Love chewy.com great customer service!! Received everything very fast and the prices are great the dog beds I bought from there there actually have memory foam in them and cost less than the egg crate stuff you find in stores. The people I spoke with on the phone were so nice ,thanks again :)

Works great very good. No bugs on my pups!!!!!!!! Much better than others I've tried prior. I will only use a topical product..., If there's a reaction, you can bathe many times and save the life of your pet, while edibles are much harder to stop the allergic reaction

This has kept my 2 60lb + Boxer/Pits (who are skin allergy prone) and 1 terrier mix flea free for 11 months! Living in the Midwest comes with humid/rainy weather where the fleas love to run rampant! After trying 3 brands I finally came upon this brand. I haven't looked back since.  I'm able to give them baths after 2 days to get rid of the greasy hair with the product still being effective. Thank you to Chewy for offering so many options for tick and flea relief.

















                                good stuff

I did use another product years ago and was unaware that the formula had been changed.  Our GSD and all 3 indoor cats got not only fleas but tape worms as well.  It was a nightmare!  K9 A II is the only thing I'll use.  I tried briefly the Trifexis but the dog refused to eat it and it required a separate tick collar that had to be worn a week before going out into the field.  No, no, no.  Back to K9 A II to stay. Good luck with the rest.  By the way, we live in the Pacific Northwest forest.

















                                The best so far!

I recently purchased PetArmor Plus and it only worked for three days at the most. I gave K9 Advantix II to my dog two days ago and YES! Not a single flea and mosquitoes even stay away! I love this stuff!

















                                Great Product!!!

The flea season came on with a vengeance and so being the mom of 5 German Shepherds who go out and play and come in we gave this a try and are Ecstatic about the results. Haven't seen any scratching or visable fleas on my babies. I would definitely recommend to others who want the protection for their furry children. Thanks Chewy for another super product at a great price !!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
