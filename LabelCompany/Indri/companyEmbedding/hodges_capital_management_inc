Hodges Capital Management
Hodges Capital is an investment advisory firm managing assets for institutions, endowments, family offices, and individuals. Hodges Capital is also the advisor to six mutual funds. Hodges Capital was founded in Dallas Texas in 1989 by Don and Craig Hodges. The Hodges Family has been involved in assisting clients with their investment needs for over 25 years.
  

Proprietary Research
We take pride in conducting our own in depth research, often starting at the source through direct contact with management teams. We balance this against objective fundamental analysis to form an investment thesis on a stock. Every company has positives and negatives – we look for both.
Our focus is common stocks and our team of six analysts covers a broad range of industries to gain a greater perspective on particular strengths and weaknesses of the overall market. Collectively we may cover approximately 900 companies at any one time, monitoring, analyzing, and dissecting each before the appropriate investment decision is made.
Invest With Us
We offer each of the Hodges Investment Strategies in a separately managed account (SMA) and unified managed account (UMA) vehicle.

Hodges Fund Lowers Expense Ratio
April 24, 2017



Hodges Funds has voluntarily lowered the fees an investor pays to invest in the fund, effective April 1, 2017.
Read Article 




* Active investing has higher management fees because of the manager’s increased level of involvement while passive investing has lower management and operating fees. Investing in both actively and passively managed mutual funds involves risk and principal loss is possible. Both actively and passively managed mutual funds generally have daily liquidity. There are no guarantees regarding the performance of actively and passively managed mutual funds. Actively managed mutual funds may have higher portfolio turnover than passively managed funds. Excessive turnover can limit returns and can incur capital gains.
The Hodges Funds are offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The fund invests in smaller companies, which involves additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involves greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. The fund may also make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested.
The S&P 500 Index is a broad based unmanaged index of 500 stocks, which is widely recognized as a representative of the equity market in general.

Proprietary Research
We take pride in conducting our own in depth research, often starting at the source through direct contact with management teams. We balance this against objective fundamental analysis to form an investment thesis on a stock. Every company has positives and negatives – we look for both.
Our focus is common stocks and our team of six analysts covers a broad range of industries to gain a greater perspective on particular strengths and weaknesses of the overall market. Collectively we may cover approximately 900 companies at any one time, monitoring, analyzing, and dissecting each before the appropriate investment decision is made.
