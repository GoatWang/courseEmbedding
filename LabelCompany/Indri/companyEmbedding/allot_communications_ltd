Network Anomaly Detection 

Home
Technology
Network Anomaly Detection









When it comes to detecting DDoS and botnet traffic, you need to get it right. Right away.
Your security appliances are constantly on the lookout for traffic irregularities that could spell trouble. When monitoring networks for traffic anomalies, you need to be able to distinguish between malicious flooding and legitimate traffic spikes. Otherwise, you run the risk of over-blocking and angering your users. And when a bona fide attack is detected, it has to be neutralized right away, without blocking or limiting legitimate traffic flows that are sharing the same network resource, often behind a NAT IP. Allot’s advanced anomaly detection technologies – Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD) and Host Behavior Anomaly Detection (HBAD) – do both. These patented technologies power Allot DDoS Protection and Bot Containment solutions which are deployed in service provider and enterprise networks worldwide, where they provide a first line of defense against cyber threats. 





Network Behavior Anomaly Detection (NBAD)
Allot’s patented NBAD technology identifies DDoS and other network flooding events by the anomalies they cause in the normally time-invariant behavior of “network ratios” i.e., combinations of Layer 3 and 4 packet rate statistics. Packet filtering rules are obtained dynamically by searching deep into the captured DDoS packets for unique repeating patterns in each event. Surgical filtering accuracy is often achieved using the patterns detected in the Layer 3 and 4 headers and layer 7 payload. Allot accurately detects network traffic anomalies caused by:

High packet rate
Small packet size or large packet size
Fan-in (many IPs to one IP), typical of DDoS attacks
Fan-out (one IP to many IPs)
DoS (one IP to one IP)
TCP-based incidents (SYN, FIN, ACK, RST, invalid flag combinations)
UDP-based incidents
ICMP (including echo request, echo reply, unreachable)
Other incidents (non-TCP, UDP or ICMP)
Incidents Involving fragmented, truncated or malformed packets
Various amplification attacks

Allot NBAD technology detects network traffic anomalies and creates attack pattern signatures in 20-50 seconds; notifies you of the attack via email, syslog, and SNMP trap (v2c), and immediately begins surgical mitigation. The inline deployment of Allot DDoS Protection solutions means that flooding attacks are stopped on the spot at the edge of your network, without having to divert huge volumes of traffic to cloud scrubbing centers.






Host Behavior Anomaly Detection (HBAD)
Allot’s patented HBAD technology detects hosts or endpoints that are generating abnormal levels of outbound connection activity such as outbound spam, as well as host traffic that exhibits malicious connection patterns matching malware infection or abusive behavior. Allot accurately detects host traffic anomalies caused by:

Address scan
Port scan
Flow bomb (bombarding the same target IP and port with a high number of flows)
Mass SMTP (address scanning or flow bombs to 25/TCP)
Mass DNS (address scanning or flow bombs to 53/UDP)
Mass ICMP (including echo request, echo reply, unreachable)

Allot HBAD technology detects anomalous host traffic in 3-5 minutes, sending notification that allows you to surgically block or limit the outbound traffic. Only anomalous traffic is blocked, even when the source of an attack is behind a NAT IP (when Allot’s DPI is deployed on the private IP space). Allot’s solution can also redirect the infected host to a captive portal for clean-up, enabling you to treat the problem at the source instead of just the symptom. Read how our NBAD and HBAD technologies, embedded in Allot’s multiservice platform, are helping network carriers thwart DDoS attacks and prevent IP domain blacklisting.

Virtualization









Accelerate Service Agility and Lower Costs with Allot’s Virtualized Multiservice Platform
Data networks are shifting dramatically as service provider and enterprise networks migrate to virtualized or cloud-based architectures. Service integration is one of the key challenges to be overcome as operators determine which part of the network to tackle first; how to approach the migration; and how to demonstrate at every step along the way that the intended benefits are being realized. 





Enabling smooth migration 
Allot solutions are uniquely poised to operate seamlessly in hybrid environments where some network functions are virtualized and others are physical in order to ensure interoperability with existing network infrastructure during the NFV migration process. Just like our physical Allot Service Gateway platforms, Allot’s virtual service delivery framework connects and coordinates data and control plane functions to enable end-to-end multiservice delivery. At every stage of your network migration to NFV, Allot’s virtual service delivery framework minimizes or even eliminates integration headaches, enabling seamless deployment and flexible operation of the virtual network functions that power your service offering. 




Assuring interoperability
The virtualized framework is compliant with the ETSI NFV blueprint, providing production-proven integration with multi-vendor networking, provisioning, charging, billing and customer engagement functions, as well as tested interoperability with multi-vendor NFV infrastructure, management and orchestration systems. 




Leveraging Know-How
NFV migration is fraught with unknowns and is not without risks. Virtualization is only part of the goal. The other important goal is to maintain all existing functionality and to be able to leverage the virtualized cloud infrastructure to implement more complex use cases that advance the operator’s business. Allot is a solution partner who has implemented hundreds of successful use cases involving Policy Control and Charging integration in demanding carrier environments. Allot starts in the lab and with proof of concept trials conducted in the customer network. Then we apply our know-how and experience to translate success in the lab to success in the operator’s production network. 






Our field-proven integration and interoperability with NFV+SDN+MANO ecosystem assures faster time to revenue for your virtualized network services.




Allot vTDF/PCEF powers Amdocs Policy Gateway Solution
Accurate traffic visibility and classification is absolutely essential for the provisioning, enforcement and charging of data services. In partnership with Amdocs, the market leader in customer experience software solutions and services for the world’s largest communications, entertainment and media service providers, Allot supplies the virtualized traffic detection (TDF) and policy enforcement (PCEF) functions for Amdocs Policy Gateway (APG) solution.

History[edit]
Allot Communications was founded in 1996, by Michael Shurman and Yigal Jacoby, who served as chief executive and chairman until 2006.[4] Jacoby previously founded Armon Networking, a manufacturer of RMON-based network management solutions, which was sold to Bay Networks for $33 million in 1996.[5]
In November 2003, Deloitte & Touche named Allot the fourth fastest-growing company on its Israel Technology Fast 50 list, citing the company's revenue growth of nearly 1,900% in a year's time.[4]
By 2004, Allot raised $38 million in several rounds of funding from several venture capital funds, including: Genesis Partners, Gemini, Walden Israel, JAFCO Investment, BancBoston Capital, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Tamar Technology Ventures.[4]
In 2006, Rami Hadar was appointed President and CEO. In November 2006, Allot became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol ALLT. The IPO raised $78 million.[6] In November 2010, Allot's dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was approved.[7]
Allot partnered with Openet in January 2011 to optimize monetization of mobile broadband networks.[8] Allot was featured on the Deloitte Fast 50 list in 2014 for a 131% growth between 2009 and 2013.[9] Allot joined the HP OpenNFV Partner Program in July 2015, allowing it to expand its Traffic Detection Function and security services onto the HP OpenNFV platform.[10][11]
Nokia Networks partnered with Allot Communications in January 2016 to enhance visibility, control and security for Swisscom.[12] Later that year, Allot partnered with Intel Security to release McAfee Unified Security Powered by Allot which focused on end-to-end security capabilities.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2002, Allot acquired NetReality, a provider of network application priority switches (NAPS), in order to enhance its quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth management solutions.[14] Allot acquired Esphion, a New Zealand–based developer of network protection solutions for carriers and Internet service providers, in January 2008. The acquisition expanded Allot's mitigation of security threats with the addition of isolation and remedy of infected subscribers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack prevention.[15] In May 2012, Allot acquired Ortiva Wireless, a San Diego-based developer of video traffic optimization equipment.[16] Allot acquired Oversi Networks, a provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, in July 2012.[17] In March 2015, Allot acquired global IT security company Optenet[18] which expanded the company's security-as-a-service offerings.[19][20]
Products[edit]
Allot provides intelligent IP service optimization solutions for DSL, wireless broadband carriers, service providers, and enterprises. Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]
Allot SmartEngage, designed to enhance company engagement with subscribers, was launched in February 2015. SmartEngage uses Allot Service Gateway's traffic awareness feature to suggest content based on browsing activity.[24][25]
In May 2015, Vodafone Germany announced its deployment of Allot WebSafe Personal, a network-based Security-as-a-Service offering designed for mobile users as well as small and medium business clients, which includes anti-malware and parental control options.[26][27] Later that same year, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition (Allot SG-VE). The original Service Gateway was introduced in 2007 to improve efficiency and monetization options for companies. The new framework integrates the Gateway framework with a virtual network to remove physical hardware constraints.[28] In February 2016, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway 9500, expanding its capabilities to include enterprises, data centers, and service providers.[29] In June 2016, Belgian cable company announced that it began using Allot Service Gateway Tera and Allot ServiceProtector for network traffic analysis along with Allot's CMTS to manage congestion and QoS assurance.[30]
Controversy[edit]
In 2011, reports alleged that Allot had been illegally selling equipment to Iran.[31][2] However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing.[32] Also in 2011, Allot settled a class-action lawsuit regarding securities fraud involving its stock whereby it agreed to pay $1.3 million (USD).[33]

Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2002, Allot acquired NetReality, a provider of network application priority switches (NAPS), in order to enhance its quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth management solutions.[14] Allot acquired Esphion, a New Zealand–based developer of network protection solutions for carriers and Internet service providers, in January 2008.

Products[edit]
Allot provides intelligent IP service optimization solutions for DSL, wireless broadband carriers, service providers, and enterprises. Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]

History[edit]
Allot Communications was founded in 1996, by Michael Shurman and Yigal Jacoby, who served as chief executive and chairman until 2006.[4] Jacoby previously founded Armon Networking, a manufacturer of RMON-based network management solutions, which was sold to Bay Networks for $33 million in 1996.[5]
In November 2003, Deloitte & Touche named Allot the fourth fastest-growing company on its Israel Technology Fast 50 list, citing the company's revenue growth of nearly 1,900% in a year's time.[4]
By 2004, Allot raised $38 million in several rounds of funding from several venture capital funds, including: Genesis Partners, Gemini, Walden Israel, JAFCO Investment, BancBoston Capital, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Tamar Technology Ventures.[4]

Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]
Allot SmartEngage, designed to enhance company engagement with subscribers, was launched in February 2015. SmartEngage uses Allot Service Gateway's traffic awareness feature to suggest content based on browsing activity.[24][25]
In May 2015, Vodafone Germany announced its deployment of Allot WebSafe Personal, a network-based Security-as-a-Service offering designed for mobile users as well as small and medium business clients, which includes anti-malware and parental control options.[26][27] Later that same year, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition (Allot SG-VE). The original Service Gateway was introduced in 2007 to improve efficiency and monetization options for companies. The new framework integrates the Gateway framework with a virtual network to remove physical hardware constraints.[28] In February 2016, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway 9500, expanding its capabilities to include enterprises, data centers, and service providers.[29] In June 2016, Belgian cable company announced that it began using Allot Service Gateway Tera and Allot ServiceProtector for network traffic analysis along with Allot's CMTS to manage congestion and QoS assurance.[30]
Controversy[edit]
In 2011, reports alleged that Allot had been illegally selling equipment to Iran.[31][2] However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing.[32] Also in 2011, Allot settled a class-action lawsuit regarding securities fraud involving its stock whereby it agreed to pay $1.3 million (USD).[33]

History[edit]
Allot Communications was founded in 1996, by Michael Shurman and Yigal Jacoby, who served as chief executive and chairman until 2006.[4] Jacoby previously founded Armon Networking, a manufacturer of RMON-based network management solutions, which was sold to Bay Networks for $33 million in 1996.[5]
In November 2003, Deloitte & Touche named Allot the fourth fastest-growing company on its Israel Technology Fast 50 list, citing the company's revenue growth of nearly 1,900% in a year's time.[4]
By 2004, Allot raised $38 million in several rounds of funding from several venture capital funds, including: Genesis Partners, Gemini, Walden Israel, JAFCO Investment, BancBoston Capital, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Tamar Technology Ventures.[4]
In 2006, Rami Hadar was appointed President and CEO. In November 2006, Allot became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol ALLT. The IPO raised $78 million.[6] In November 2010, Allot's dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was approved.[7]
Allot partnered with Openet in January 2011 to optimize monetization of mobile broadband networks.[8] Allot was featured on the Deloitte Fast 50 list in 2014 for a 131% growth between 2009 and 2013.[9] Allot joined the HP OpenNFV Partner Program in July 2015, allowing it to expand its Traffic Detection Function and security services onto the HP OpenNFV platform.[10][11]
Nokia Networks partnered with Allot Communications in January 2016 to enhance visibility, control and security for Swisscom.[12] Later that year, Allot partnered with Intel Security to release McAfee Unified Security Powered by Allot which focused on end-to-end security capabilities.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2002, Allot acquired NetReality, a provider of network application priority switches (NAPS), in order to enhance its quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth management solutions.[14] Allot acquired Esphion, a New Zealand–based developer of network protection solutions for carriers and Internet service providers, in January 2008. The acquisition expanded Allot's mitigation of security threats with the addition of isolation and remedy of infected subscribers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack prevention.[15] In May 2012, Allot acquired Ortiva Wireless, a San Diego-based developer of video traffic optimization equipment.[16] Allot acquired Oversi Networks, a provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, in July 2012.[17] In March 2015, Allot acquired global IT security company Optenet[18] which expanded the company's security-as-a-service offerings.[19][20]

Allot Communications Announces Executive Changes
Jul 17 17
Allot Communications Ltd. announced that Mr.  Manuel Echanove has been appointed to the Board of Directors of the
company (the "Board") to fill the seat previously held by Mr. Rami Hadar who is stepping down to pursue other business interests. The appointment will be effective immediately. Mr. Echanove's appointment will require approval of the company's shareholders at the company's next Annual General Shareholder Meeting. Mr. Echanove is currently the CEO of Wetania Consulting S.L.


Satellite Service Providers Selects Allot Communications Ltd. to Optimize Network Traffic, Protect Against Distributed Denial of Service (Ddos) Attacks, Increase Revenues, and Support Regulatory Compliance Efforts
Jun 27 17
Allot Communications Ltd. announced that it was selected by one of Russia's top satellite service providers to optimize network traffic, protect against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, increase revenues, and support regulatory compliance efforts. With this additional deployment of the Allot Service Gateway multi-service platform, which includes Allot Service Protector for DDoS Mitigation, Quota Management and Allot Content Protector, the company's customers in Russia represent approximately 70% of the Russian VSAT market in terms of stations. With Allot Service Gateway, the Satellite communications providers can expect to improve QoE, optimize network infrastructure, increase their revenues and comply with government regulation through: Traffic Management to optimize TCP connections on each satellite hub, limiting heavy-bandwidth services like P2P and file transfer. Bot Containment to enable endpoint monitoring for anomalous behavior and the isolation of infected botnets that congested the network through outbound attacks and jeopardized satellite equipment. Quota Management to facilitate the delivery of an improved subscriber QoE for certain services, even when subscribers are out-of-quota. Content Protection to allow compliance with government regulations for dynamic filtering of hundreds of thousands of suspected or malicious URLs. DDoS Protection to detect and mitigate zero day attacks whilst keeping critical network elements and the Satellite network services up and running.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Allot Communications was founded in 1996, by Michael Shurman and Yigal Jacoby, who served as chief executive and chairman until 2006.[4] Jacoby previously founded Armon Networking, a manufacturer of RMON-based network management solutions, which was sold to Bay Networks for $33 million in 1996.[5]
In November 2003, Deloitte & Touche named Allot the fourth fastest-growing company on its Israel Technology Fast 50 list, citing the company's revenue growth of nearly 1,900% in a year's time.[4]
By 2004, Allot raised $38 million in several rounds of funding from several venture capital funds, including: Genesis Partners, Gemini, Walden Israel, JAFCO Investment, BancBoston Capital, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Tamar Technology Ventures.[4]
In 2006, Rami Hadar was appointed President and CEO. In November 2006, Allot became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol ALLT. The IPO raised $78 million.[6] In November 2010, Allot's dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was approved.[7]
Allot partnered with Openet in January 2011 to optimize monetization of mobile broadband networks.[8] Allot was featured on the Deloitte Fast 50 list in 2014 for a 131% growth between 2009 and 2013.[9] Allot joined the HP OpenNFV Partner Program in July 2015, allowing it to expand its Traffic Detection Function and security services onto the HP OpenNFV platform.[10][11]
Nokia Networks partnered with Allot Communications in January 2016 to enhance visibility, control and security for Swisscom.[12] Later that year, Allot partnered with Intel Security to release McAfee Unified Security Powered by Allot which focused on end-to-end security capabilities.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2002, Allot acquired NetReality, a provider of network application priority switches (NAPS), in order to enhance its quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth management solutions.[14] Allot acquired Esphion, a New Zealand–based developer of network protection solutions for carriers and Internet service providers, in January 2008. The acquisition expanded Allot's mitigation of security threats with the addition of isolation and remedy of infected subscribers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack prevention.[15] In May 2012, Allot acquired Ortiva Wireless, a San Diego-based developer of video traffic optimization equipment.[16] Allot acquired Oversi Networks, a provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, in July 2012.[17] In March 2015, Allot acquired global IT security company Optenet[18] which expanded the company's security-as-a-service offerings.[19][20]
Products[edit]
Allot provides intelligent IP service optimization solutions for DSL, wireless broadband carriers, service providers, and enterprises. Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]
Allot SmartEngage, designed to enhance company engagement with subscribers, was launched in February 2015. SmartEngage uses Allot Service Gateway's traffic awareness feature to suggest content based on browsing activity.[24][25]
In May 2015, Vodafone Germany announced its deployment of Allot WebSafe Personal, a network-based Security-as-a-Service offering designed for mobile users as well as small and medium business clients, which includes anti-malware and parental control options.[26][27] Later that same year, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition (Allot SG-VE). The original Service Gateway was introduced in 2007 to improve efficiency and monetization options for companies. The new framework integrates the Gateway framework with a virtual network to remove physical hardware constraints.[28] In February 2016, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway 9500, expanding its capabilities to include enterprises, data centers, and service providers.[29] In June 2016, Belgian cable company announced that it began using Allot Service Gateway Tera and Allot ServiceProtector for network traffic analysis along with Allot's CMTS to manage congestion and QoS assurance.[30]
Controversy[edit]
In 2011, reports alleged that Allot had been illegally selling equipment to Iran.[31][2] However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing.[32] Also in 2011, Allot settled a class-action lawsuit regarding securities fraud involving its stock whereby it agreed to pay $1.3 million (USD).[33]

The acquisition expanded Allot's mitigation of security threats with the addition of isolation and remedy of infected subscribers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack prevention.[15] In May 2012, Allot acquired Ortiva Wireless, a San Diego-based developer of video traffic optimization equipment.[16] Allot acquired Oversi Networks, a provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, in July 2012.[17] In March 2015, Allot acquired global IT security company Optenet[18] which expanded the company's security-as-a-service offerings.[19][20]
Products[edit]
Allot provides intelligent IP service optimization solutions for DSL, wireless broadband carriers, service providers, and enterprises. Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]
Allot SmartEngage, designed to enhance company engagement with subscribers, was launched in February 2015. SmartEngage uses Allot Service Gateway's traffic awareness feature to suggest content based on browsing activity.[24][25]
In May 2015, Vodafone Germany announced its deployment of Allot WebSafe Personal, a network-based Security-as-a-Service offering designed for mobile users as well as small and medium business clients, which includes anti-malware and parental control options.[26][27] Later that same year, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition (Allot SG-VE). The original Service Gateway was introduced in 2007 to improve efficiency and monetization options for companies. The new framework integrates the Gateway framework with a virtual network to remove physical hardware constraints.[28] In February 2016, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway 9500, expanding its capabilities to include enterprises, data centers, and service providers.[29] In June 2016, Belgian cable company announced that it began using Allot Service Gateway Tera and Allot ServiceProtector for network traffic analysis along with Allot's CMTS to manage congestion and QoS assurance.[30]
Controversy[edit]
In 2011, reports alleged that Allot had been illegally selling equipment to Iran.[31][2] However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing.[32] Also in 2011, Allot settled a class-action lawsuit regarding securities fraud involving its stock whereby it agreed to pay $1.3 million (USD).[33]

History[edit]
Allot Communications was founded in 1996, by Michael Shurman and Yigal Jacoby, who served as chief executive and chairman until 2006.[4] Jacoby previously founded Armon Networking, a manufacturer of RMON-based network management solutions, which was sold to Bay Networks for $33 million in 1996.[5]
In November 2003, Deloitte & Touche named Allot the fourth fastest-growing company on its Israel Technology Fast 50 list, citing the company's revenue growth of nearly 1,900% in a year's time.[4]
By 2004, Allot raised $38 million in several rounds of funding from several venture capital funds, including: Genesis Partners, Gemini, Walden Israel, JAFCO Investment, BancBoston Capital, Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Tamar Technology Ventures.[4]
In 2006, Rami Hadar was appointed President and CEO. In November 2006, Allot became a publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol ALLT. The IPO raised $78 million.[6] In November 2010, Allot's dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was approved.[7]
Allot partnered with Openet in January 2011 to optimize monetization of mobile broadband networks.[8] Allot was featured on the Deloitte Fast 50 list in 2014 for a 131% growth between 2009 and 2013.[9] Allot joined the HP OpenNFV Partner Program in July 2015, allowing it to expand its Traffic Detection Function and security services onto the HP OpenNFV platform.[10][11]
Nokia Networks partnered with Allot Communications in January 2016 to enhance visibility, control and security for Swisscom.[12] Later that year, Allot partnered with Intel Security to release McAfee Unified Security Powered by Allot which focused on end-to-end security capabilities.[13]
Acquisitions[edit]
In September 2002, Allot acquired NetReality, a provider of network application priority switches (NAPS), in order to enhance its quality of service (QoS) and bandwidth management solutions.[14] Allot acquired Esphion, a New Zealand–based developer of network protection solutions for carriers and Internet service providers, in January 2008. The acquisition expanded Allot's mitigation of security threats with the addition of isolation and remedy of infected subscribers and Distributed Denial of Service (DDos) attack prevention.[15] In May 2012, Allot acquired Ortiva Wireless, a San Diego-based developer of video traffic optimization equipment.[16] Allot acquired Oversi Networks, a provider of rich-media caching and content delivery solutions for Internet video and peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, in July 2012.[17] In March 2015, Allot acquired global IT security company Optenet[18] which expanded the company's security-as-a-service offerings.[19][20]
Products[edit]
Allot provides intelligent IP service optimization solutions for DSL, wireless broadband carriers, service providers, and enterprises. Allot's portfolio of hardware platforms and software applications employs DPI to turn broadband pipes into smart networks, so that value-added Internet services can be rapidly deployed. Allot SG-Sigma, released in 2009, was designed to increase subscriber Quality of Experience (QoE) with the ability to generate additional revenue streams.[3]
In 2014, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway Tera as a unified framework for physical and virtual deployment across access networks.[21] In December 2014, Allot unveiled Allot Cloud Access Optimization, designed for enterprises and cloud managed service providers, which has three levels of coverage and can be used with Office 365 and adds visibility, control and security to applications.[22][23]
Allot SmartEngage, designed to enhance company engagement with subscribers, was launched in February 2015. SmartEngage uses Allot Service Gateway's traffic awareness feature to suggest content based on browsing activity.[24][25]
In May 2015, Vodafone Germany announced its deployment of Allot WebSafe Personal, a network-based Security-as-a-Service offering designed for mobile users as well as small and medium business clients, which includes anti-malware and parental control options.[26][27] Later that same year, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway-Virtual Edition (Allot SG-VE). The original Service Gateway was introduced in 2007 to improve efficiency and monetization options for companies. The new framework integrates the Gateway framework with a virtual network to remove physical hardware constraints.[28] In February 2016, Allot released the Allot Service Gateway 9500, expanding its capabilities to include enterprises, data centers, and service providers.[29] In June 2016, Belgian cable company announced that it began using Allot Service Gateway Tera and Allot ServiceProtector for network traffic analysis along with Allot's CMTS to manage congestion and QoS assurance.[30]
Controversy[edit]
In 2011, reports alleged that Allot had been illegally selling equipment to Iran.[31][2] However, in January 2012 Allot was cleared by the Ministry of Defense of any wrongdoing.[32] Also in 2011, Allot settled a class-action lawsuit regarding securities fraud involving its stock whereby it agreed to pay $1.3 million (USD).[33]
