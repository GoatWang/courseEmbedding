                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

This RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT
(this “Agreement”) is made as of June 1, 2015, by
and between CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC BANK, a California corporation (in
such capacity and for purposes of this Agreement only, the
“Seller”), and CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC FUNDING, LLC, a

“Purchaser”).

WHEREAS, in the regular course of
its business, motor vehicle retail installment sale contracts and
motor vehicle loans secured in each case by an automobile, sport
utility vehicle, light duty truck or similar motor vehicle
(“Auto Receivables”) were assigned by dealers to the
Seller, each of which Auto Receivables was originated by the dealer
in the state where such dealer was located;

WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to
purchase from Seller a portfolio of Auto Receivables (the
“Receivables”);

WHEREAS, Seller is willing to sell
such Receivables to Purchaser;

WHEREAS, Seller is selling such
Receivables to Purchaser and Purchaser is buying such Receivables
for the purpose of selling those Receivables to California Republic
Auto Receivables Trust 2015-2 which will in turn issue notes and
certificates backed by the cash flow from those Receivables in a
transaction contemplated by the parties to this Agreement and the
other Basic Documents (as defined below) to be a
“securitization” as that term is defined in 12 CFR
§360.6 (the “FDIC Rule”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in reliance upon the
foregoing recitals, in consideration of the premises and the mutual
covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

ARTICLE I
DEFINITIONS

Section 1.01.
Definitions . Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
are used in this Agreement as defined in Appendix A of the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2015, among

California Republic Funding, LLC, as Depositor, California Republic
Bank, as Seller, Servicer, Administrator and Custodian, and
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Indenture Trustee, or in
the Amended and Restated Trust Agreement, dated as of June 1,
2015, between California Republic Funding, LLC, as Depositor, and
Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Owner
Trustee.

Section 1.02. Other
Interpretive Provisions . For purposes of this Agreement,
unless the context otherwise requires: (a) accounting terms
not otherwise defined in this Agreement, and accounting terms
partly defined in this Agreement to the extent not defined, shall
have the respective meanings given to them under GAAP;
(b) terms defined in Article 9 of the California UCC and not
otherwise defined in this Agreement are used as defined in that
Article; (c) the words “hereof,”
“herein” and “hereunder” and words of
similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement; (d) references to any
Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit are references to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits in or to this Agreement and
references to any paragraph, subsection, clause or other
subdivision within


any Section or definition refer to such
paragraph, subsection, clause or other subdivision of such Section
or definition; (e) the term “including” means

ARTICLE II
PURCHASE AND SALE OF RECEIVABLES

Section 2.01. Purchase and
Sale of Receivables . Effective as of the Closing Date and
immediately prior to the transactions pursuant to the Indenture,
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, and the Trust Agreement, Seller
does hereby sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey
to Purchaser, without recourse (subject to the obligations herein),
all right, title and interest of Seller in and to the Conveyed
Assets.

The sale, transfer, assignment,
setting over and conveyance made hereunder shall not constitute and
is not intended to result in an assumption by Purchaser of any
obligation of Seller to the Obligors, the Dealers or any other
Person in connection with the Receivables and the other assets and
properties conveyed hereunder or any agreement, document or
instrument related thereto.

It is the intention of the parties
hereto that, other than for federal, State and local income, single
business or franchise tax purposes, the transfer and assignment of
the Conveyed Assets on the Closing Date constitutes an absolute
sale (and not a pledge to secure debt or other obligations of the
Seller) of the Conveyed Assets such that (i) the Conveyed
Assets shall not be included in the bankruptcy estate of the Seller
pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 541, (ii) the FDIC
shall not, by exercise of its authority to disaffirm or repudiate
contracts under Section 13(e) of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, reclaim, recover or recharacterize as property of the Seller
any Conveyed Assets transferred by the Seller to Purchaser or
disregard the separateness of Purchaser or the Issuer from the
Seller, and (iii) the transfer of Conveyed Assets pursuant to
this Agreement shall comply with the requirements of 12 C.F.R.
Section 360.6. If, notwithstanding the intention of Seller and
Purchaser, such conveyance is deemed to be a pledge in connection
with a financing or is otherwise deemed not to be a sale (a
“Recharacterization”), Seller hereby grants, and the
parties intend that Seller shall have granted to the Purchaser, a
first priority perfected security interest in all of Seller’s
right, title and interest in all of the Conveyed Assets and all
proceeds of the foregoing, and that this Agreement shall constitute
a security agreement under Applicable Law and the Purchaser shall
have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor
under the UCC as in force in the relevant jurisdictions. In the
case of any Recharacterization, each of Seller and Purchaser
represents and warrants as to itself that each remittance of
collections by Seller to Purchaser hereunder will have been
(i) in payment of a debt incurred by Seller in the ordinary
course of business or financial affairs of Seller and Purchaser and
(ii) made in the ordinary course of business or financial
affairs of Seller and Purchaser
 
2



Effective as of the Closing Date,
the Seller shall retain possession of the Receivable Files in its
capacity as Custodian.

Section 2.02. Receivables
Purchase Price . In consideration for the Conveyed Assets,
Purchaser shall, on the Closing Date, pay to Seller the Receivables
Purchase Price. The “Receivables Purchase Price” shall
be $405,069,150.63 payable in cash.

Section 2.03. Expenses .
In connection with the purchase of the Receivables hereunder and
the issuance and sale of the Notes and placement of the
Certificates, the Seller shall pay (or shall reimburse the
Underwriter and the Placement Agent or any other Person to the
extent that the Underwriter or the Placement Agent or such other
Person shall pay), to the extent any of the amounts below have not
been paid by Purchaser pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, including: (i) expenses incident to the preparing,
printing, reproducing and distributing of the Prospectus and the
Private Placement Memorandum, (ii) the fees and expenses of
qualifying the Notes and Certificates under the securities laws of
the several jurisdictions and of preparing, printing and
distributing any blue sky survey (including related fees and
expenses of counsel to the Underwriter and the Placement Agent),
(iii) any fees charged by a Rating Agency in connection with
the rating of the Notes, (iv) the fees of DTC in connection
with the book-entry registration of the Notes and Certificates,
(v) the fees and disbursements of the Indenture Trustee and
the Owner Trustee and their respective counsels, (vi) the fees
and disbursements of the accountants, and (vii) the fees and
disbursements of the Underwriter and Placement Agent and, as
previously agreed upon, their counsel.
