Celebrating 25 years

















Careers
With its inherent natural beauty, educational opportunities and lifestyle advantages, the Upper Valley, Lake Sunapee, and Concord regions have much to offer people who live and work here. Recognizing the unique character and needs of the communities in the area, Ledyard National Bank was founded in 1991 with a mission to provide the very best in locally-delivered, personalized banking services.
Since that time, Ledyard has grown to become a leading financial services organization with seven full-service community-banking offices and the area’s premier investment, tax and wealth management division, Ledyard Financial Advisors. We truly believe that our growth and success is a direct result of the skills, dedication and hard work of all our employees.
A Culture of Community and Caring
Ledyard employees believe in providing superlative, personal service to our clients. As an institution, we foster a workplace where respect and caring extends to both co-workers and clients. We know that each employee plays an integral role in our success, and we recognize these contributions by encouraging personal and professional growth.
We continually strive to improve our service, products and technology – we’re a community bank with “big bank” capabilities. As a result, Ledyard is a great place to work and bank.
In the words of Gail Broughton, one of Ledyard’s first employees: “Working for Ledyard National Bank is an opportunity to be part of a local community bank that is committed to community involvement and innovative business banking; there is great satisfaction in being part of team that is an industry leader.
