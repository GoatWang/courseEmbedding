Mr. Bill Frank, President
CareerLab
10475 Park Meadows Drive, Ste. 600
Lone Tree, CO 80124-5437

Dear Bill:

I am looking for some advice and counsel from you, as a friend I know and trust. In December 19__, I became the Controller of TERRA Corporation. The position appeared to have everything I wanted:

A great product that improved the quality of life (Ultrasound for surgery);
An entrepreneurial environment that encouraged change and free thinking;
The potential of an IPO within two years; and,
The opportunity to work with a dedicated management team and venture capital groups.


Unfortunately, the uncertainly of healthcare reform, consolidation of payers and hospitals, and the investment community’s view of medical capital equipment companies has led all venture investors to be cautious with additional investment dollars in healthcare device companies. As a result, the company has decided to eliminate certain functional groups in their entirety (including finance and administration) while seeking an alliance partner or acquirer. These changes will most likely result in my departure from TERRA effective March 31, 19__. While my contributions, commitment and skills have been recognized, these staff reductions are absolutely necessary.

The good news is that I have a wonderful network of successful professionals that are well respected in the Denver marketplace. Additionally, the CEO, President and several venture capitalists are happy to provide a strong testimony to my skills and performance.

In today’s professional marketplace, few quality positions at my level ever reach the newspapers or executive recruiting firms. For that reason, I am soliciting your help in my search for new opportunities. Perhaps you, or one of your business associates, are aware of a company that needs someone of my capabilities. If so, I would appreciate your giving them a copy of the enclosed resume, and I would like their name so that I can contact them personally.

I would appreciate your thoughts and ideas. Please contact me either at work (303) 555-1234 or at home (303) 555-1212, with any input or feedback. Thanks for your help.

Best regards,

Richard P. Dutkiewicz

25 Reasons I love consulting.
            by William S. Frank 

Brand. You are your own brand, and you can define it any way you want. For many years, I provided outplacement to the ex-employees of Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield service corporation. When departing employees left the company, they didn't request outplacement in their severance package. They said, "I want Bill Frank."
Demand. The world will always be full of terrible problems that need solving.
White Hat. I can be a helper and get paid for it.
Pay. I can be paid to do things I'd gladly do for nothing.
Variety. Every day is different.
Happiness. At this stage of my career, I only work for people I respect and care about. If a client micromanages me or is otherwise no fun, I complete the assignment and replace them.
Talent. I'm using 110% of my talents and stretching myself to the max.
Change. I can change my focus any day I want. If you're a McDonald's franchisee, you don't say, "Hey, I've got this great idea for a meatball sandwich—let's try it out today." In consulting you can adjust your focus hour-by-hour, as long as your clients still understand and appreciate what you do.
Income. No one else would pay me as much as I pay myself.
FUN. I can't think of anything I'd rather be doing.
Retirement. I can write and consult as long as I am physically and mentally capable. Peter Drucker worked into his 90s, and when asked which book was his best, he said: "My next one."
Job Security. Although clients come and go, no one can come into my office and say, "Pack up your stuff . . . You don't work here anymore." In 29 years, I've only had one employer: ME.
Travel. I don't have to travel unless I decide to. I travel if it's both FUN and profitable—or at least FUN.
Commute. I live five minutes from my office, a corner office in an upscale six-story tower. In winter, I leave a heated garage at home and drive to an underground heated garage at work. There's seldom time to hear even one song on the radio.
Vacation. Consulting is more fun than vacation (except on Wailea Beach in Maui).
Friends. I have developed hundreds of close acquaintances and several lifetime friends.
Time. I can work as much or as little as I like: four-hour days or 18-hour days. (Of course, my income will reflect that.)
Employees. I can work with employees, subcontractors, partners, or alone—I've done it all.
Passive Income. I've developed several products that provide "mailbox money." I earn while I'm sleeping.
Ethics. I've never had to violate my values or personal code of ethics. I've never had to lie, purposely deceive or harm others, or promise things I can't deliver. I go to bed with a clear conscience. That doesn't mean there's never any conflict. But the conflict is conducted according to generally accepted business practices.
Virtual. My career is fairly portable. With the Internet, e-mail, cell phone, and FedEx, I can work nationally, even internationally from my office—or anywhere in the world.
Purpose. I make a difference in peoples' lives every day. I see it in their faces, hear it in their voices, and read it in their thank-yous.
Experience. Every painful or joyful life experience makes me a better consultant. So does every person I meet or book I read. Grey hair can be good in consulting.
Structure. I have to work very hard, and the clients expect superb results—but I get to structure my days, weeks, months, and years.
Boss. Most of the time, I love my boss.

            As I was posting these letters online, I realized I want to communicate my love for consulting. It's just a great business. The single letters, taken together, may create a picture of enjoyment, but in a burst of creativity I listed some of the reasons consulting is such a good fit for me—and perhaps for you, too. They are not prioritized; this is just how they came out.
