Initiating Relationship


Most investment firms set a minimum dollar investment size  on who they will take as a client.  This  is an understandable practice with which we agree.
We have another screen that we use to help assure a good fit  between our investment firm and client.   We limit our relationships to investors with a mature attitude.  We define maturity as the willingness to  defer gratification, as opposed to those who need to be satisfied in a  quarterly or annual time frame.
We believe a minimum of five years is needed to evaluate  investment performance results.   Therefore, we look for maturity in matching up clients with our  conservative bent.  This is one of the  aspects that we discuss in our early meetings with prospective clients.  We prefer to meet with all prospective  clients.  Please contact us at (630)  941-9460, or send and email to info@graybillbartz.com.
 
                Why Choose Graybill, Bartz, & Associates: 

Investment services since 1969
Conservative, growth investing

Graybill, Bartz, & Associates - Overview




































Our Company History





Graybill, Bartz & Associates, Ltd. has been in the investment services business since 1969. In the early years, under the name of R.W. Graybill Ltd., Bob Graybill’s growth stock investment philosophy helped investors through insightful newsletters and individually managed accounts.
Sharing the same philosophy, integrity and commitment to clients, Steven Bartz and Bob Graybill joined forces in 1996. The company’s name was changed to reflect this strong partnership. Since then, Steve has directed the firm’s investment management activities. 
As the firm’s clients and assets continued to grow, Philip Karlson joined Graybill, Bartz & Associates, Ltd., as a principal in 2000. Phil is Executive Vice President and Chief Equity Strategist. Don Canfield joined the firm in 2004, adding over 25 years of investment management experience and depth to the leadership team. Don is a principal of the firm and also serves as the firm’s compliance and operations specialist.
As the firm’s fixed income holdings increased, we retained the services of a large institutional bond management firm in 2001 to monitor credit quality and consult on strategy.  In February 2009 we hired Gary Dhein from that institutional bond firm to oversee the fixed income strategy for Graybill, Bartz & Associates, Ltd.  Gary, now a principal of the firm, has implemented a Prime Brokerage Platform that allows us to obtain research and buy bonds from major bond providers across the United States.
Today, Graybill, Bartz & Associates, Ltd. is a well-respected investment management organization stressing capital preservation, growth, and close client relationships and service.  Our clients include individuals, company pension and profit sharing accounts, as well as foundations and tax-exempt organizations.  Within our client base, we have an expertise in working with physicians and other medical professionals.

Graybill, Bartz, & Associates - Investment Philosophy - Strategy and Products


































 


Strategy and Products
Graybill, Bartz & Associates employs a fundamental, research-driven approach to develop custom, diversified portfolios for our clients, which include individuals, pension and other retirement plans, as well as charitable foundations.  Our initial meetings with clients help to determine the appropriate asset allocation for their portfolios.  These meetings often include an aspect of financial planning that takes into account retirement goals, income needs and risk tolerance. 
Over the past several years, we have expanded our portfolio management team and added to our investment products to better meet the unique needs of our clients.  While all portfolios are customized to meet client goals and objectives, they generally fall into the following product categories:
Balanced Portfolio 
This approach utilizes individual equity and fixed-income instruments to provide a balance between growth and income.  We seek diversification through exposure to multiple asset classes including domestic and international equities from small to large capitalizations.  Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are used to gain diversified exposure to certain equity and fixed income asset classes.  The asset allocation of our portfolios varies over time based on opportunities in the equity and fixed-income markets and can be customized based on client circumstances.  Our Equity and Fixed-Income philosophies are explained in further detail in the following pages.
Income Portfolio 
This approach is intended for that portion of a client’s assets for which income generation is the sole objective.  Our fixed-income approach, which is described in the following pages, is combined with other income-generating securities, such as preferred stock and real-estate-investment-trusts, to generate a higher level of income while carefully mitigating risk.  Again, asset allocation for this strategy varies among clients based on income needs and risk tolerance.
Mutual Fund Strategy 
This approach is intended for that portion of a client’s assets for which adequate diversification among many asset classes can best be achieved through the use of mutual funds.  Often, these accounts represent a portion of a client’s assets that are segregated for tax or estate purposes, such as in IRAs or trusts.  Our goal with this strategy is to build well diversified portfolios using many different mutual funds and with an asset allocation that is similar to that of our larger balanced portfolios.

Graybill, Bartz, & Associates - Investment Philosophy - Fixed Income Philosophy


































 


Fixed Income Philosophy
Overview 
It is our belief that the fixed income portion of a well diversified portfolio provides a stable anchor to the overall plan.  Over the long term, the equity portion rewards investors with greater return while bonds provide important diversification and stability.  It follows from this belief that the fixed income portion should not be the riskier portion.  For this reason, we mainly focus on investment grade bonds.  When we believe the risk/ reward profile is favorable, however, we will opportunistically purchase high-yield securities or exchange-traded-funds (ETF’s) that participate in the high yield securities market. 
Corporate Bond Strategy
We look to the areas of the bond market which provide incremental income – this leads us to corporate bonds, our main emphasis for fixed income.  We have many years of experience in analyzing companies that issue corporate bonds.
Portfolio Construction
In developing bond portfolios, we favor spreading out maturities over a number of years to reduce the reinvestment risk.   Our typical purchase is an intermediate bond with a maturity of 5 to 8 years.  The major issuers in this maturity range tend to be financial institutions.  We have extensive experience in analyzing financial entities, so our client’s bond portfolios will typically have representation in this sector.   We diversify across industrial companies as well and include utilities when available.  For high tax bracket clients in taxable accounts we also utilize tax exempt bonds – we make these determinations based on the tax equivalent yield and relative credit quality.
For larger portfolios, we favor investing in individual bonds instead of bond funds.  The yield to maturity is known at the time of purchase and as long as the bond is held to maturity, the investor knows the return.  For bond funds, however, there is no maturity and the net asset value of the fund can change daily. 
Institutional Network
Since bonds, unlike stocks, are not traded on an exchange, it is important to have multiple dealer relationships.  Over the course of many years of experience investing in bonds, we have built up relationships with quite a few individuals and broker/dealers.  We have the advantage of dealing with many different firms in the bond business.  Some have municipal bond expertise, some specialize in corporate bonds.   A few of them offer economic or credit research, some specialize in transacting in small quantities.  The advantage is that we are not confined to dealing with one or two firms when transacting bonds.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
