In addition to MogulREIT I, accredited Investors can invest in private placements on the RealtyMogul.com platform.

What are the benefits of using RealtyMogul.com?

RealtyMogul.com makes it easy for accredited, non-accredited, and institutional investors to invest in real estate
We provide access that was historically limited and pre-vet every investment in the marketplace. We spend countless hours sourcing real estate investments so you don’t have to. We also allow you to invest in real estate with dramatically smaller check sizes. Instead of $50,000 or $100,000 minimums, you can buy shares of investments with as little as $1,000. And we make the process frictionless – allowing you to screen investments online, sign legal documents online, and have access to all your documents in one place on your investor dashboard.
For institutional investors, we are a source of efficient and technology-based production, helping them diversify their portfolio while getting access to a wide suite of commercial debt products.

What types of investments does RealtyMogul.com offer?

On RealtyMogul.com, you can invest in two primary investment types: loans (debt) or equity:

Real Estate Loans (debt): In this investment type, investors purchase a specific loan or a pool of loans.  The underlying loan is tied to a residential or commercial property and the loan is secured by the property until the borrower repays the loan in full.  Investors earn monthly interest on their money typically with a balloon payment at the end.  Hold periods for the loans could be as short as a few months and as long as a few years.
Equity Investments:  In this investment type, we focus on equity investments with existing cash-flow, like apartment buildings, office buildings, retail shopping centers, and self-storage facilities. With this type of investment, investors pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific property or a pool of properties.  The investment is acquired and managed by a professional real estate investment company, also known as a “sponsor”, with a track record of acquiring and managing real estate.  Investors are typically entitled to a share of the cash-flow from rents as well as a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold.  The hold period for an investment like this may range from 1-10 years.


How does an investment opportunity get listed on RealtyMogul.com?

Real estate companies or individuals list their investment opportunities in the RealtyMogul.com marketplace only after joining RealtyMogul.com, submitting an application, and going through an underwriting and due diligence process.
For equity investments, the RealtyMogul.com underwriting team along with our broker-dealer partner, North Capital, reviews their materials and determines whether the company and the investment is a good fit for our members. We go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including return structure, market statistics, quality of the property and the track record, reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with. This process also includes background, criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud. Finally, we always tour the property as a final step before it is listed. We reject many equity transactions that are proposed to us, keeping in mind one of our core values - Investor Protection.
At RealtyMogul.com, we look for transactions that provide cash flow to investors as quickly as possible.  Some properties may have some level of vacancy or have the ability for our operating partner to add value and increase cash flow over the life of the investment.  We do not currently fund ground-up development, as we believe one of the benefits of real estate investing is passive income and development projects typically take 18-36 months to generate income. We do fund apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, hotels, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.
For debt investments, RealtyMogul.com provides loans for commercial properties including apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.  We examine many variables when evaluating debt investment opportunities.  For loans on commercial properties, we evaluate metrics including debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, and debt yields. Regardless of loan type, we look for borrowers with a successful track record and make sure they undergo background and credit checks so we can ensure financial competence and responsibility.
The liens associated with our debt are frequently “senior” or in “first position,” so in the event of a borrower default, our investors have first claim to the proceeds in the event of a foreclosure.  Most of these loans are short-term, ranging from 6-36 months before principal is repaid. We may from time to time offer debt in the second position (mezzanine debt), which is subordinate to our more frequent offering of senior debt.  Investors are always made aware of the debt position prior to making an investment decision.

Are the investments secure?

Although no investment is guaranteed, one benefit of investing with RealtyMogul.com is that you are investing in physical assets around the United States. Your investment is in an actual property as opposed to a stock or bond or other non-physical asset.

Are these investments risky?

Yes. Similar to investing in the stock market, there is no guarantee when you are investing in real estate. The real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change.

Does RealtyMogul.com do background or credit checks when new investors register with the site?

Yes. Our broker-dealer, North Capital, runs KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering on all who invest in deals on our site. Additionally, on some offerings where advertising may have been used, some additional verification of an investor’s status as an accredited investor may be required.

Is there an investment minimum?

Yes. The minimum investment is different for each investment, but can be as low as $1,000. 

Are there fees for investors?

Joining RealtyMogul.com and browsing the marketplace requires no obligation. For those who choose to invest, there are fees associated with each investment.  The fees depend on the type of investment (loan purchase or equity purchase) and the nature of the transaction.  In addition to administrative and legal expenses, the fees will cover the ongoing reporting and communications for the investments. As we are big believers in transparency, you can find the specific fee structure for each deal when you browse through our investment opportunities.

How does the investment process work?

An investment is not final until all legal documents are signed and funding has been contributed and cleared.  When an investor makes their investment, the money is held securely at a US bank.  Once the fundraising target is met and the real estate transaction is completed, the money is transferred for the sole purpose of the specific loan or specific property that is being invested in.

How do investors transfer funds to RealtyMogul.com?

Standard ACH transfer can be made from an investor’s bank account for amounts up to $100,000. Amounts larger than $100,000 are made using a wire transfer. For each investment opportunity there will be specific account numbers that we will provide to the investor so that funds are properly received on our end.

How are legal documents handled on RealtyMogul.com?

All legal documents can be sent and signed electronically through our website. This allows for more efficient and seamless transfer of documents between you and RealtyMogul.com, while maintaining the authenticity and security of your information. Investments are finalized once proper legal documentation is accepted, funds are confirmed received, and we provide you with completed counterpart signatures.

Can I use an SDIRA or other type of IRA for my investment and cash flow distributions?

At this time, we can (and regularly do) process debt investments made through a self-directed IRA account, but it will depend on your custodian's processes/procedures.  Our two requirements are that the custodian be able to process documents via electronic signatures, and that it be able to process contributions and distributions via ACH transfer payments. Unfortunately, some custodians have problems meeting these conditions; inquire of your current custodian whether they can work with these requirements, and if not, we can refer you over to other providers who can meet these guidelines.

How will investors be updated about their investment status?

Investors will be able to view real time updates of their investments when they login to the site and view their investor dashboard.  This is their hub of information, and will provide comprehensive metrics about their distributions to date, upcoming milestones, and overall return on investment.  Additional emails are sent out when distributions are sent to your bank account.

Once invested, how do investors get regular updates about their investments?

RealtyMogul.com will work with the real estate company to provide timely updates shared with all investors at least quarterly.  Updates will be provided via email and via the investor dashboard. In addition, investors will receive tax documents every year that they have a distribution from a real estate investment on RealtyMogul.com.

How will my investment cash flow allocations be distributed?

Investors who invest in debt typically receive interest payments on a monthly basis, while investors who invest in equity typically receive quarterly distributions.
Usually we will send the cash flow income to the same bank account that the investor provided for their original investment, though we can accommodate changing a distribution bank account by request.  We ask for bank information that will allow for monthly or quarterly standard ACH transfers.
Distributions are never guaranteed in amount or timing and you should carefully read the offering documents on the specific deal you are interested in to fully understand how projected distributions look like and what risks are involved.

Is my investment liquid?

No.  The real estate investments found on RealtyMogul.com are private transactions in physical properties around the United States.  The investments are not traded on public stock exchanges and cannot be easily sold or traded.
You may be able to resell your investment security in a private transaction subject to restrictions that are specific to each investment and under the Securities Act of 1933. Since the resale restrictions on RealtyMogul.com can be very limiting, you should not invest with the expectation of reselling your investment.

When will I get my investment back?

Different properties have different expected hold periods.  A hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is re-sold or the loan on it is paid off.  It is important to read the offering documents for each investment opportunity for a deeper understanding of the hold period for each investment.

I see the name North Capital on your website. Who is North Capital?

North Capital is RealtyMogul.com’s broker-dealer partner who provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyMogul.com.

What happens if RealtyMogul.com goes out of business? 

In the event of a corporate bankruptcy, there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide, however, we would work to put replacement servicers in place for all RealtyMogul.com transactions.

 




Invest in Equity



What types of properties are available through equity investments?

RealtyMogul.com offers access to a variety of property types including, but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality.

How are equity investments structured?

Investors are typically purchasing shares in a Realty Mogul Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) that in turn invests into an LLC or Limited Partnership (“LP”) that holds title to the real property.

When I invest in equity investments on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in an equity opportunity, you are typically purchasing shares of an LLC as a limited member. In turn, that LLC owns (directly or indirectly), along with the sponsor and other investors, a share of a joint venture entity that owns a specific investment property, like a specific apartment building. An LLC gives you liability protection, shielding your personal assets from the investment.

Why do investors invest into a Realty Mogul LLC instead of directly into the company that holds title to the real property?

By investing into a Realty Mogul LLC, it minimizes overhead for the sponsors who work with RealtyMogul.com and allows us to access more investment opportunities for investors. It also allows for streamlined reporting, distributions, and tax documentation through the RealtyMogul.com platform.

Who makes decisions in an LLC?

Decisions in an LLC are governed by a document called an “operating agreement”. While every operating agreement is slightly different, they usually include a manager (who may also be a member) and limited members. The manager typically makes all of the day-to-day decisions and the limited members act as passive investors on the transaction. The manager can determine how much cash to distribute to the limited members versus how much to hold in reserve and assess possible sales for the property. There are certain activities that might mandate a vote by the limited members and the limited members can typically take action if the managing member defaults on the terms of the agreement or is grossly negligent.

Who makes decisions in the Realty Mogul LLC that investors contribute to?

RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com is typically the Managing Member of Realty Mogul LLCs.  RM Manager is an Exempt Reporting Advisor. RM Manager does not own a piece of the Realty Mogul LLCs, but is responsible for certain limited decision making. However, you will need to review the specific offering materials for each investment to fully understand the structure and the duties of all entities involved.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to equity investors each quarter. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What if I invested in equity and more money is needed for the property in the future? Am I obligated to invest more as an equity owner?

RealtyMogul.com investments typically do not have capital calls.  A capital call is where the investor is required to commit more money to the property, beyond the initial investment.  Rather than requiring an additional investment, it is possible that investors will be diluted if more money needs to be raised. While this is typically the case with equity investments offered on RealtyMogul.com, please check the offering materials for each investment to fully understand your liabilities as an investor.

What are the tax implications of investing in Equity opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

One of the benefits of investing in real estate equity through limited liability companies (LLCs) is that LLCs can be treated as partnerships for tax purposes. Partnerships generally are not taxed at the entity level (other than annual franchise taxes and filing fees) and can “pass through” applicable items of income, loss and depreciation to their members.

Non-cash depreciation deductions can shelter or eliminate the amount taxable income that may be otherwise passed through to an investor from a real estate equity investment, particularly in the early stages of the investment. As a result, cash distributions received by an investor, in a year when there is no corresponding pass-through of taxable income (again, due to depreciation deductions), may result in lower or deferred taxes.
The special purpose entity (a Realty Mogul LLC) you own when you invest in an equity transaction reports your annual share of income and loss and distributions on federal and state K-1s that you can then use to prepare your tax return. While the special purpose entities (the Realty Mogul LLCs) that are formed for each equity transaction typically are Delaware entities, there may be filing requirements and tax liabilities in other states depending on the details of a particular transaction, your state of residence, and the location of the investment property.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.

 




Invest in Debt



What types of loan/debt investments can investors make?

When investing in loans, investors will either acquire a borrower payment dependent promissory note (a “Platform Note”) from Realty Mogul, Co. or purchase a whole loan.

When I invest in a Platform Note on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in a Platform Note, you are purchasing an unsecured note in Realty Mogul, Co., the performance of which is tied to the underlying real estate loan.  This Platform Note allows you to receive periodic payments on the loan if and when the borrower on the underlying real estate loan makes interest payments.

Are Platform Notes secured by real estate?

No, the Platform Notes are not secured by real estate.

When Investing in Platform Notes, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

No, an investor will not need to fund additional amounts once the initial investment has been made.

Who is eligible to buy whole loans?

Institutional investors looking to invest >$25 million are eligible to buy whole loans from RealtyMogul.com. These whole loans differ from the Platform Notes in that they are secured by real estate.

When investing in whole loans, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

Yes, an investor will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default when purchasing whole loans.

If a borrower stops paying, what happens?

If a borrower stops paying, we will determine what loan modification or loss mitigation options to pursue before beginning foreclosure proceedings. RealtyMogul.com will inform all investors if any significant actions are taken on their specific loan investments.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to debt investors each month. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What are the tax implications of investing in Debt opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

Tax information regarding first lien debt investments is reported annually to investors on Form 1099.  For other types of debt (like mezzanine debt), distributions may be characterized as interest, dividends, or other distributions, and investors may receive either a Form 1099 or a Federal and state Form K-1, depending on the structure of the transaction.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.


 




Invest in MogulREIT



What is MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I is a limited liability company formed to invest in and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate investments, such as loans, equity in commercial real estate ventures, and other real estate-related assets.
MogulREIT I is a registered, non-traded REIT. That means that it is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but is not traded on a stock exchange. 

What types of properties or investments go into MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I can invest in a variety of property types, including but not limited to, multifamily, office, industrial, self-storage, and retail real estate opportunities. MogulREIT I can invest in various commercial real estate-related equity and debt assets across these different property types

Who can invest in MogulREIT I?

MogulREIT I is available to both accredited and non-accredited investors. For non-accredited investors, limitations based on the investor’s annual income or net worth apply to the amount that may be invested.

What is the minimum amount I can invest in MogulREIT I?

For most investors, the minimum investment is $1,000 and investors may invest additional capital in increments of $1,000.
For Self-Directed IRA (“SDIRA”) investors, the minimum investment is $10,000 and $1,000 thereafter.
For a Registered Investment Advisor (“RIA”) account, the minimum investment is $25,000 for the first transaction and $1,000 thereafter.

How liquid is an investment in MogulREIT I?

Redemptions from the fund are generally allowed on a quarterly basis, subject to the redemptions rights and limitations outlined in the Offering Circular.

How is investing in MogulREIT I different from other investment opportunities offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform?

The RealtyMogul.com Platform currently offers individual real property-related investments as private placements to accredited investors only. The RealtyMogul.com Platform allows accredited investors to review due diligence materials for individual transactions and invest in one transaction at a time. Investing in MogulREIT I is different since investment decisions are made by its Manager, RM Adviser, LLC, and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT I is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform. RM Adviser, LLC charges a 1% asset management fee for managing MogulREIT I and its investments, whereas the other investment opportunities offered through the RealtyMogul.com Platform may charge fees that are higher or lower. Finally, MogulREIT I is set up as a “blind pool” REIT, which means that it is not committed to acquiring any particular investments with the net proceeds of its offering. Investing in MogulREIT I can lead to greater diversification because MogulREIT I intends to invest its assets in multiple real estate opportunities. However, unlike other investments on the RealtyMogul.com Platform, a purchaser of common shares in MogulREIT I may not know what investments MogulREIT I will make with its assets at the time the investor purchases common shares in MogulREIT I.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is managed by RM Adviser, LLC, a SEC registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of Realty Mogul, Co. RM Adviser, which manages MogulREIT I’s day-to-day operations, will have access to the experienced team of real estate finance professionals employed by Realty Mogul, Co., including Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at Realty Mogul have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. MogulREIT I expects to benefit from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles.
The credit team of Realty Mogul and its affiliates is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. This team has substantial experience in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments and has adopted approaches used by real estate finance industry leaders in its analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies, and these approaches will be brought to bear for MogulREIT I’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on MogulREIT I’s investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If MogulREIT I chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the REIT, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

 




Invest in 1031



What is a 1031 Exchange?

A 1031 exchange is a strategy for deferring the capital gains tax from the sale of a property. By exchanging a relinquished property for like-kind real estate, owners may be able to defer their federal taxes and use the proceeds for the purchase of replacement property.

What is “like-kind property”?

Generally any form of property held for business or investment purposes qualifies including Apartment Buildings, Single-Family Rentals, Vacant Land, Office Buildings, Self-Storage Facilities, Shopping Centers, and Hotels. These property types may be 1031 eligible properties.

What does it mean to be “1031 eligible”?

Not all real estate investments are eligible for 1031 exchanges. In order for your investment in real property to be 1031 eligible you must have a direct ownership in the underlying real estate. Debt investments aren’t eligible because they are interests in a promissory note, not the underlying real estate. Similarly, partnership interests (including LLC’s) where an investor owns a share of a partnership interest instead of a share of the underlying real estate would be ineligible. However, per the IRS’s Revenue Ruling 2004-86, ownership of a beneficiary interest in a Delaware Statutory Trust does qualify to be part of an investor’s 1031 Exchange.

What is a Delaware Statutory Trust Property?

Commonly known as “DST”, this entity is often used to hold title to real estate similar to an LLC. Instead of owning a membership interest in an LLC, a DST investor owns a beneficial interest in the DST. Also like an LLC, the entity shields the investor from individual liability. However, unlike an LLC, a DST 1031 property will qualify as a “like kind” exchange replacement property for a 1031 exchange per Internal Revenue Ruling 2004-86.

What are the downsides of investing in a DST?


      The DST is typically managed by the DST Trustee and the beneficial owners do not have voting right like they would typically have in an LLC. Instead the DST and therefore the real property investments held by the DST are managed by the Trustee, not the investors themselves. Additionally, the IRS established seven prohibitions over the powers of the DST Trustee, which includes the following:
      
Once the offering is closed, there can be no future equity contribution to the DST by either current or new co-investors or beneficiaries.
The DST Trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans, nor can it borrow any new funds from any other lender or party.
The DST Trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its investment real estate.
The DST Trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property to those for a) normal repair and maintenance, (b) minor non-structural capital improvements, and (c) those required by law.
Any liquid cash held in the DST between distribution dates can only be invested in short-term debt obligations.
All cash, other than necessary reserves, must be distributed to the co-investors or beneficiaries on a current basis, and
The Trustee cannot enter into new leases or renegotiate the current leases.


What is a Springing LLC?

DST Agreements often contain a provision that allows the Trustee to convert the DST to an LLC (the “Springing LLC”) if the Trustee determines that the DST is in danger of losing the property due to its inability to act because of the prohibitions in the trust agreement. The conversion to an LLC will allow the Trustee, who becomes the Manager of the LLC to raise additional funds, renegotiate terms of existing debt, and enter into new leases. However, because a membership interest in a Springing LLC is not a 1031 eligible the members (investors) lose their ability to defer capital gains upon the sale of the property owned by the LLC through another 1031 exchange.

What are the basic requirements to complete a 1031 Exchange?


      The following is a list of the basic elements involved in typical 1031 Exchanges:
      
A Qualified Intermediary, sometimes referred to as a “1031 Accommodator” is used to exchange the funds from the real estate that is sold to the real estate that is purchased.
Investors identify their replacement properties (typically 3 properties) with their 1031 Accommodator within 45 days of sale of the initial property.
Investors reinvest 100% of the net sales proceeds from the initial property sale into their replacement properties.
Investors acquire an equal or greater amount of debt on the replacement properties than they had on their initial properties.
Investors close on the purchase of the replacement properties within 180 days of the sale of their initial property.

1031 Exchanges can be very complicated and you should consult with your CPA and Attorney before proceeding with an exchange.

Can I invest if I do not currently own a 1031 eligible property?

Yes. “Cash Investors” are investors who use non-1031 money to invest in a 1031 eligible deal. Once they have completed their investment, those investment funds become 1031 eligible and can be used as part of a 1031 exchange in the future.

All RealtyMogul.com investors are pooled into a special purpose vehicle, typically an LLC, and then RealtyMogul.com subscribes to the sponsor’s entity as a single investor.

What reporting is required?

RealtyMogul.com requires quarterly qualitative and quantitative investor reporting.

Does the sponsor interact directly with individual investors?

Typically, the sponsor deals and interacts with RealtyMogul.com only, but in certain instances RealtyMogul.com will make direct introductions to the sponsor.

Does RealtyMogul.com require control rights?

Depending on how much equity the Realty Mogul LLC is investing, RM Manager, LLC, RealtyMogul.com's affiliated Exempt Reporting Advisor, may require some control rights or consent rights. We do require manager removal for gross negligence, fraud or other deceit.

How long does it take to fund a transaction?

Most transactions are funded within 45-60 days of submission.

Can a sponsor white-label the technology?

No, RealtyMogul.com does not currently have a white-label solution.

What is your deal approval process?

RealtyMogul.com has a two-stage approval process that involves a full underwriting of the investment and a tour of the asset.

What is the return profile of RealtyMogul.com's targeted investments?

RealtyMogul.com is a value-added investment partner generally targeting individual projects with a levered IRR objective of 15% or greater, and cash-on-cash yields at stabilization of 8% or greater. However, each deal is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Does RealtyMogul.com raise capital from non-accredited investors?

No. We only work with accredited investors.

Approximately how many equity transactions has RealtyMogul.com completed to-date?

RealtyMogul.com has raised approximately $70 million for approximately 55 joint ventures.

What type of equity does RealtyMogul.com provide?

RealtyMogul.com will invest as either pari-passu common equity, or as preferred equity where the common equity is subordinated.

Does RealtyMogul.com require sponsors to invest their own equity into their transactions?

Yes. We typically require sponsors to co-invest 10% of the total equity requirement of a transaction.

Who is North Capital?

RealtyMogul.com is aligned with North Capital Private Securities Corp. (NCPS), a broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC and many RealtyMogul.com employees are also affiliated with North Capital. All equity raises are done through North Capital.

 




Borrower – Raise Debt



What is the process to get a loan?

To apply for a loan, start the application process here. You’ll be asked a quick series of questions about the property and you. Our propriety technology then will screen your application and if found to be suited, one of our account executives will reach out to discuss further details and provide you with a quote.

What types of loans does RealtyMogul.com offer?

RealtyMogul.com offers loans for acquisition and refinance of commercial properties like apartments, office, retail, industrial, self-storage, mixed use, and more.
We offer three main loan products:

Private “Hard” money loans: 1-2 year term, $0.5-10 million, full recourse, interest only at 9%+. Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.
Bridge loans: 2-5 year term, $3-50 million size, non-recourse, interest only at Libor +4-7%. Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.
Permanent loans: 5-10 year term, $1-50 million size, non-recourse, interest only at market rate.  Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.


What types of properties does RealtyMogul.com lend on?

RealtyMogul.com lends on single and multi-tenant office buildings, manufactured home communities, multifamily and student housing, anchored and unanchored retail buildings, industrial, warehouse and flex properties, self-storage facilities, and mixed use properties.

Is it the same as borrowing from a traditional bank or private lender?

While we make loans similar to a traditional or private lender, our online systems and technology are designed to enhance the process and provide capital throughout the full capital stack.

How do borrowers benefit?

Borrowers benefit from competitive interest rates, a quicker and more transparent underwriting process, flexibility in product offerings and loan structures.

What rates do you charge?

We offer competitive interest rates but they are subject to a variety of factors including property location, loan size, and experience of the borrower.  For CMBS loans, we charge market rates.  For bridge loans, we are typically priced between Libor + 4% to Libor + 7%.  For private money loans, we typically charge 8-12%.

What states do you lend in?

All except NV, AZ, ND, SD, TN, MN, VT.

How long does the process take and what does it include?

Although this is determined on a case-by-case basis, we aspire to fund within 30-45 days from application submission. The process typically includes an in-house underwriting, third party reports review, site visit, documentation and legal review.

Where does the money to make the loans come from?

The majority of our loans are sold to institutional investors who we have defined relationships or joint venture agreements with.

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp.").

Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
 

At Lightstone, we believe investing in large-scale, commercial real estate shouldn’t be limited to large corporations, institutions, or high net worth individuals. Since 2005, Lightstone has offered investors the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate through its various public non-traded REIT offerings.
A real estate investment trust is a company that owns, and in many cases manages, income-producing real estate. Investors purchase shares within the REIT and receive a pro-rata share of income that is derived from the real estate. REITs offer distinct advantages for investors, including: portfolio diversification and income through a transparent and regulated operating structure.
Lightstone’s Non-Traded REIT offerings, include:

Lightstone Value Plus REIT, Inc. (closed to new investors)

NEW YORK—Lightstone Value Plus Real Estate Investment Trust III, Inc. announced it has acquired the 120-key Hampton Inn at Des Moines International Airport for $10.9 million. This marks the first acquisition for the public, non-traded REIT. The purchase further increases Lightstone's footprint in Des Moines, adding to its 2013 purchase of SpringHill Suites by Marriott and Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott.
The Hampton Inn is one of the closest properties to the Des Moines International Airport and is in close proximity to downtown Des Moines.
"We're excited to make our third acquisition in the Des Moines area, which represents our confidence in this region, with its strong economy and low unemployment", said David Lichtenstein, chairman and CEO of Lightstone. "This property is strategically located in a highly desirable area that is widely recognized for its significant presence in the insurance and financial services sectors."
The property will be placed under new management, which will be overseen by Lightstone's hospitality division.

What are the benefits of using RealtyMogul.com?

RealtyMogul.com makes it easy for accredited, non-accredited, and institutional investors to invest in real estate
We provide access that was historically limited and pre-vet every investment in the marketplace. We spend countless hours sourcing real estate investments so you don’t have to. We also allow you to invest in real estate with dramatically smaller check sizes. Instead of $50,000 or $100,000 minimums, you can buy shares of investments with as little as $1,000. And we make the process frictionless – allowing you to screen investments online, sign legal documents online, and have access to all your documents in one place on your investor dashboard.
For institutional investors, we are a source of efficient and technology-based production, helping them diversify their portfolio while getting access to a wide suite of commercial debt products.

What types of investments does RealtyMogul.com offer?

On RealtyMogul.com, you can invest in two primary investment types: loans (debt) or equity:

Real Estate Loans (debt): In this investment type, investors purchase a specific loan or a pool of loans.  The underlying loan is tied to a residential or commercial property and the loan is secured by the property until the borrower repays the loan in full.  Investors earn monthly interest on their money typically with a balloon payment at the end.  Hold periods for the loans could be as short as a few months and as long as a few years.
Equity Investments:  In this investment type, we focus on equity investments with existing cash-flow, like apartment buildings, office buildings, retail shopping centers, and self-storage facilities. With this type of investment, investors pool their money to purchase a piece of a specific property or a pool of properties.  The investment is acquired and managed by a professional real estate investment company, also known as a “sponsor”, with a track record of acquiring and managing real estate.  Investors are typically entitled to a share of the cash-flow from rents as well as a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold.  The hold period for an investment like this may range from 1-10 years.


How does an investment opportunity get listed on RealtyMogul.com?

Real estate companies or individuals list their investment opportunities in the RealtyMogul.com marketplace only after joining RealtyMogul.com, submitting an application, and going through an underwriting and due diligence process.
For equity investments, the RealtyMogul.com underwriting team along with our broker-dealer partner, North Capital, reviews their materials and determines whether the company and the investment is a good fit for our members. We go to great lengths to fully understand the variables of each transaction including return structure, market statistics, quality of the property and the track record, reputation and quality of the real estate investment company we are working with. This process also includes background, criminal and credit checks to mitigate the risk of fraud. Finally, we always tour the property as a final step before it is listed. We reject many equity transactions that are proposed to us, keeping in mind one of our core values - Investor Protection.
At RealtyMogul.com, we look for transactions that provide cash flow to investors as quickly as possible.  Some properties may have some level of vacancy or have the ability for our operating partner to add value and increase cash flow over the life of the investment.  We do not currently fund ground-up development, as we believe one of the benefits of real estate investing is passive income and development projects typically take 18-36 months to generate income. We do fund apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, hotels, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.
For debt investments, RealtyMogul.com provides loans for commercial properties including apartment buildings, self-storage facilities, mobile home parks, office and multi-tenant industrial buildings and retail shopping centers.  We examine many variables when evaluating debt investment opportunities.  For loans on commercial properties, we evaluate metrics including debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, and debt yields. Regardless of loan type, we look for borrowers with a successful track record and make sure they undergo background and credit checks so we can ensure financial competence and responsibility.
The liens associated with our debt are frequently “senior” or in “first position,” so in the event of a borrower default, our investors have first claim to the proceeds in the event of a foreclosure.  Most of these loans are short-term, ranging from 6-36 months before principal is repaid. We may from time to time offer debt in the second position (mezzanine debt), which is subordinate to our more frequent offering of senior debt.  Investors are always made aware of the debt position prior to making an investment decision.

Are the investments secure?

Although no investment is guaranteed, one benefit of investing with RealtyMogul.com is that you are investing in physical assets around the United States. Your investment is in an actual property as opposed to a stock or bond or other non-physical asset.

Are these investments risky?

Yes. Similar to investing in the stock market, there is no guarantee when you are investing in real estate. The real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change.

Does RealtyMogul.com do background or credit checks when new investors register with the site?

Yes. Our broker-dealer, North Capital, runs KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering on all who invest in deals on our site. Additionally, on some offerings where advertising may have been used, some additional verification of an investor’s status as an accredited investor may be required.

Is there an investment minimum?

Yes. The minimum investment is different for each investment, but can be as low as $1,000. 

Are there fees for investors?

Joining RealtyMogul.com and browsing the marketplace requires no obligation. For those who choose to invest, there are fees associated with each investment.  The fees depend on the type of investment (loan purchase or equity purchase) and the nature of the transaction.  In addition to administrative and legal expenses, the fees will cover the ongoing reporting and communications for the investments. As we are big believers in transparency, you can find the specific fee structure for each deal when you browse through our investment opportunities.

How does the investment process work?

An investment is not final until all legal documents are signed and funding has been contributed and cleared.  When an investor makes their investment, the money is held securely at a US bank.  Once the fundraising target is met and the real estate transaction is completed, the money is transferred for the sole purpose of the specific loan or specific property that is being invested in.

How do investors transfer funds to RealtyMogul.com?

Standard ACH transfer can be made from an investor’s bank account for amounts up to $100,000. Amounts larger than $100,000 are made using a wire transfer. For each investment opportunity there will be specific account numbers that we will provide to the investor so that funds are properly received on our end.

How are legal documents handled on RealtyMogul.com?

All legal documents can be sent and signed electronically through our website. This allows for more efficient and seamless transfer of documents between you and RealtyMogul.com, while maintaining the authenticity and security of your information. Investments are finalized once proper legal documentation is accepted, funds are confirmed received, and we provide you with completed counterpart signatures.

Can I use an SDIRA or other type of IRA for my investment and cash flow distributions?

At this time, we can (and regularly do) process debt investments made through a self-directed IRA account, but it will depend on your custodian's processes/procedures.  Our two requirements are that the custodian be able to process documents via electronic signatures, and that it be able to process contributions and distributions via ACH transfer payments. Unfortunately, some custodians have problems meeting these conditions; inquire of your current custodian whether they can work with these requirements, and if not, we can refer you over to other providers who can meet these guidelines.

How will investors be updated about their investment status?

Investors will be able to view real time updates of their investments when they login to the site and view their investor dashboard.  This is their hub of information, and will provide comprehensive metrics about their distributions to date, upcoming milestones, and overall return on investment.  Additional emails are sent out when distributions are sent to your bank account.

Once invested, how do investors get regular updates about their investments?

RealtyMogul.com will work with the real estate company to provide timely updates shared with all investors at least quarterly.  Updates will be provided via email and via the investor dashboard. In addition, investors will receive tax documents every year that they have a distribution from a real estate investment on RealtyMogul.com.

How will my investment cash flow allocations be distributed?

Investors who invest in debt typically receive interest payments on a monthly basis, while investors who invest in equity typically receive quarterly distributions.
Usually we will send the cash flow income to the same bank account that the investor provided for their original investment, though we can accommodate changing a distribution bank account by request.  We ask for bank information that will allow for monthly or quarterly standard ACH transfers.
Distributions are never guaranteed in amount or timing and you should carefully read the offering documents on the specific deal you are interested in to fully understand how projected distributions look like and what risks are involved.

Is my investment liquid?

No.  The real estate investments found on RealtyMogul.com are private transactions in physical properties around the United States.  The investments are not traded on public stock exchanges and cannot be easily sold or traded.
You may be able to resell your investment security in a private transaction subject to restrictions that are specific to each investment and under the Securities Act of 1933. Since the resale restrictions on RealtyMogul.com can be very limiting, you should not invest with the expectation of reselling your investment.

When will I get my investment back?

Different properties have different expected hold periods.  A hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is re-sold or the loan on it is paid off.  It is important to read the offering documents for each investment opportunity for a deeper understanding of the hold period for each investment.

I see the name North Capital on your website. Who is North Capital?

North Capital is RealtyMogul.com’s broker-dealer partner who provides compliance and regulatory oversight to RealtyMogul.com.

What happens if RealtyMogul.com goes out of business? 

In the event of a corporate bankruptcy, there would be uncertainty and ultimately it would be up to the bankruptcy courts to decide, however, we would work to put replacement servicers in place for all RealtyMogul.com transactions.

 




Invest in Equity



What types of properties are available through equity investments?

RealtyMogul.com offers access to a variety of property types including, but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, self-storage, retail, medical office, and hospitality.

How are equity investments structured?

Investors are typically purchasing shares in a Realty Mogul Limited Liability Company (“LLC”) that in turn invests into an LLC or Limited Partnership (“LP”) that holds title to the real property.

When I invest in equity investments on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in an equity opportunity, you are typically purchasing shares of an LLC as a limited member. In turn, that LLC owns (directly or indirectly), along with the sponsor and other investors, a share of a joint venture entity that owns a specific investment property, like a specific apartment building. An LLC gives you liability protection, shielding your personal assets from the investment.

Why do investors invest into a Realty Mogul LLC instead of directly into the company that holds title to the real property?

By investing into a Realty Mogul LLC, it minimizes overhead for the sponsors who work with RealtyMogul.com and allows us to access more investment opportunities for investors. It also allows for streamlined reporting, distributions, and tax documentation through the RealtyMogul.com platform.

Who makes decisions in an LLC?

Decisions in an LLC are governed by a document called an “operating agreement”. While every operating agreement is slightly different, they usually include a manager (who may also be a member) and limited members. The manager typically makes all of the day-to-day decisions and the limited members act as passive investors on the transaction. The manager can determine how much cash to distribute to the limited members versus how much to hold in reserve and assess possible sales for the property. There are certain activities that might mandate a vote by the limited members and the limited members can typically take action if the managing member defaults on the terms of the agreement or is grossly negligent.

Who makes decisions in the Realty Mogul LLC that investors contribute to?

RM Manager, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RealtyMogul.com is typically the Managing Member of Realty Mogul LLCs.  RM Manager is an Exempt Reporting Advisor. RM Manager does not own a piece of the Realty Mogul LLCs, but is responsible for certain limited decision making. However, you will need to review the specific offering materials for each investment to fully understand the structure and the duties of all entities involved.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to equity investors each quarter. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What if I invested in equity and more money is needed for the property in the future? Am I obligated to invest more as an equity owner?

RealtyMogul.com investments typically do not have capital calls.  A capital call is where the investor is required to commit more money to the property, beyond the initial investment.  Rather than requiring an additional investment, it is possible that investors will be diluted if more money needs to be raised. While this is typically the case with equity investments offered on RealtyMogul.com, please check the offering materials for each investment to fully understand your liabilities as an investor.

What are the tax implications of investing in Equity opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

One of the benefits of investing in real estate equity through limited liability companies (LLCs) is that LLCs can be treated as partnerships for tax purposes. Partnerships generally are not taxed at the entity level (other than annual franchise taxes and filing fees) and can “pass through” applicable items of income, loss and depreciation to their members.

Non-cash depreciation deductions can shelter or eliminate the amount taxable income that may be otherwise passed through to an investor from a real estate equity investment, particularly in the early stages of the investment. As a result, cash distributions received by an investor, in a year when there is no corresponding pass-through of taxable income (again, due to depreciation deductions), may result in lower or deferred taxes.
The special purpose entity (a Realty Mogul LLC) you own when you invest in an equity transaction reports your annual share of income and loss and distributions on federal and state K-1s that you can then use to prepare your tax return. While the special purpose entities (the Realty Mogul LLCs) that are formed for each equity transaction typically are Delaware entities, there may be filing requirements and tax liabilities in other states depending on the details of a particular transaction, your state of residence, and the location of the investment property.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.

 




Invest in Debt



What types of loan/debt investments can investors make?

When investing in loans, investors will either acquire a borrower payment dependent promissory note (a “Platform Note”) from Realty Mogul, Co. or purchase a whole loan.

When I invest in a Platform Note on RealtyMogul.com, what do I own?

When you invest in a Platform Note, you are purchasing an unsecured note in Realty Mogul, Co., the performance of which is tied to the underlying real estate loan.  This Platform Note allows you to receive periodic payments on the loan if and when the borrower on the underlying real estate loan makes interest payments.

Are Platform Notes secured by real estate?

No, the Platform Notes are not secured by real estate.

When Investing in Platform Notes, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

No, an investor will not need to fund additional amounts once the initial investment has been made.

Who is eligible to buy whole loans?

Institutional investors looking to invest >$25 million are eligible to buy whole loans from RealtyMogul.com. These whole loans differ from the Platform Notes in that they are secured by real estate.

When investing in whole loans, if a loan defaults, is there any obligation to invest more?

Yes, an investor will be responsible for the cost of any foreclosure in the event of a default when purchasing whole loans.

If a borrower stops paying, what happens?

If a borrower stops paying, we will determine what loan modification or loss mitigation options to pursue before beginning foreclosure proceedings. RealtyMogul.com will inform all investors if any significant actions are taken on their specific loan investments.

How often should distributions be expected?

Distributions depend on the specific investment, but are typically provided to debt investors each month. Please review the expected distribution schedule for each investment before making an investment. No distributions are guaranteed.

What are the tax implications of investing in Debt opportunities with RealtyMogul.com?

Tax information regarding first lien debt investments is reported annually to investors on Form 1099.  For other types of debt (like mezzanine debt), distributions may be characterized as interest, dividends, or other distributions, and investors may receive either a Form 1099 or a Federal and state Form K-1, depending on the structure of the transaction.
Realty Mogul, Co. and its affiliates do not provide tax, legal, or accounting advice. This material has been prepared for informational purposes only, and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for, tax, legal or accounting advice. You should consult your own tax, legal, and accounting advisors before engaging in any transaction.  See offering documents for additional details, disclosures, and disclaimers.

Investing in MogulREIT I is different since investment decisions are made by its Manager, RM Adviser, LLC, and you are investing in a diversified portfolio and not a specific transaction or property. Additionally, MogulREIT I is accessible to both accredited and non-accredited investors and offers a lower investment minimum than some of the transactions offered on the RealtyMogul.com Platform. RM Adviser, LLC charges a 1% asset management fee for managing MogulREIT I and its investments, whereas the other investment opportunities offered through the RealtyMogul.com Platform may charge fees that are higher or lower. Finally, MogulREIT I is set up as a “blind pool” REIT, which means that it is not committed to acquiring any particular investments with the net proceeds of its offering. Investing in MogulREIT I can lead to greater diversification because MogulREIT I intends to invest its assets in multiple real estate opportunities. However, unlike other investments on the RealtyMogul.com Platform, a purchaser of common shares in MogulREIT I may not know what investments MogulREIT I will make with its assets at the time the investor purchases common shares in MogulREIT I.

Who is on the Manager team of MogulREIT?

MogulREIT I is managed by RM Adviser, LLC, a SEC registered investment adviser and wholly-owned subsidiary of Realty Mogul, Co. RM Adviser, which manages MogulREIT I’s day-to-day operations, will have access to the experienced team of real estate finance professionals employed by Realty Mogul, Co., including Jilliene Helman, its Chief Executive Officer. Many of the senior executives and loan origination professionals at Realty Mogul have deep experience in the commercial real estate sector and have been in leadership roles at financial services institutions for many years. Collectively, these professionals have approximately 200 years of combined direct experience in the commercial real estate business, and have managed more than $4 billion of originations and more than $8.5 billion in underwritings in commercial real estate loans and equity investments. MogulREIT I expects to benefit from the knowledge and industry contacts, experience and judgment that these professionals have accumulated over numerous real estate cycles.
The credit team of Realty Mogul and its affiliates is very experienced in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments. This team has substantial experience in reviewing and underwriting commercial real estate investments and has adopted approaches used by real estate finance industry leaders in its analysis of real estate capital structures and financial strategies, and these approaches will be brought to bear for MogulREIT I’s benefit.

What services will the Manager perform?

The Manager performs the following services: investment advisory and acquisition services (including performing due diligence on MogulREIT I’s investments), offering services, asset management services, accounting and other administrative services, shareholder services, financing services, and disposition services.

How does RealtyMogul.com decide which investments go into the fund and which don’t?

MogulREIT I pursues the investment strategy using the criteria described in its Offering Circular. Some opportunities may arise which could be allocated to either MogulREIT I or the RealtyMogul.com Platform. In these instances, any potential debt investment exceeding $1,000,000 and equity investment exceeding $1,500,000 will first be made available to MogulREIT I. If MogulREIT I chooses not to invest and the investment opportunity meets the investment criteria for Realty Mogul, then those investment opportunities will be made available to other investors through the RealtyMogul.com Platform. MogulREIT I may, where the investment committee of its Manager determines that the size of an investment would create undue concentration in its portfolio or that the entire investment would otherwise be unsuitable for the REIT, permit a portion of an investment to be sold on the RealtyMogul.com Platform.

 




Invest in 1031



What is a 1031 Exchange?

A 1031 exchange is a strategy for deferring the capital gains tax from the sale of a property. By exchanging a relinquished property for like-kind real estate, owners may be able to defer their federal taxes and use the proceeds for the purchase of replacement property.

What is “like-kind property”?

Generally any form of property held for business or investment purposes qualifies including Apartment Buildings, Single-Family Rentals, Vacant Land, Office Buildings, Self-Storage Facilities, Shopping Centers, and Hotels. These property types may be 1031 eligible properties.

What does it mean to be “1031 eligible”?

Not all real estate investments are eligible for 1031 exchanges. In order for your investment in real property to be 1031 eligible you must have a direct ownership in the underlying real estate. Debt investments aren’t eligible because they are interests in a promissory note, not the underlying real estate. Similarly, partnership interests (including LLC’s) where an investor owns a share of a partnership interest instead of a share of the underlying real estate would be ineligible. However, per the IRS’s Revenue Ruling 2004-86, ownership of a beneficiary interest in a Delaware Statutory Trust does qualify to be part of an investor’s 1031 Exchange.

What is a Delaware Statutory Trust Property?

Commonly known as “DST”, this entity is often used to hold title to real estate similar to an LLC. Instead of owning a membership interest in an LLC, a DST investor owns a beneficial interest in the DST. Also like an LLC, the entity shields the investor from individual liability. However, unlike an LLC, a DST 1031 property will qualify as a “like kind” exchange replacement property for a 1031 exchange per Internal Revenue Ruling 2004-86.

What are the downsides of investing in a DST?


      The DST is typically managed by the DST Trustee and the beneficial owners do not have voting right like they would typically have in an LLC. Instead the DST and therefore the real property investments held by the DST are managed by the Trustee, not the investors themselves. Additionally, the IRS established seven prohibitions over the powers of the DST Trustee, which includes the following:
      
Once the offering is closed, there can be no future equity contribution to the DST by either current or new co-investors or beneficiaries.
The DST Trustee cannot renegotiate the terms of the existing loans, nor can it borrow any new funds from any other lender or party.
The DST Trustee cannot reinvest the proceeds from the sale of its investment real estate.
The DST Trustee is limited to making capital expenditures with respect to the property to those for a) normal repair and maintenance, (b) minor non-structural capital improvements, and (c) those required by law.
Any liquid cash held in the DST between distribution dates can only be invested in short-term debt obligations.
All cash, other than necessary reserves, must be distributed to the co-investors or beneficiaries on a current basis, and
The Trustee cannot enter into new leases or renegotiate the current leases.


What is a Springing LLC?

DST Agreements often contain a provision that allows the Trustee to convert the DST to an LLC (the “Springing LLC”) if the Trustee determines that the DST is in danger of losing the property due to its inability to act because of the prohibitions in the trust agreement. The conversion to an LLC will allow the Trustee, who becomes the Manager of the LLC to raise additional funds, renegotiate terms of existing debt, and enter into new leases. However, because a membership interest in a Springing LLC is not a 1031 eligible the members (investors) lose their ability to defer capital gains upon the sale of the property owned by the LLC through another 1031 exchange.

What are the basic requirements to complete a 1031 Exchange?


      The following is a list of the basic elements involved in typical 1031 Exchanges:
      
A Qualified Intermediary, sometimes referred to as a “1031 Accommodator” is used to exchange the funds from the real estate that is sold to the real estate that is purchased.
Investors identify their replacement properties (typically 3 properties) with their 1031 Accommodator within 45 days of sale of the initial property.
Investors reinvest 100% of the net sales proceeds from the initial property sale into their replacement properties.
Investors acquire an equal or greater amount of debt on the replacement properties than they had on their initial properties.
Investors close on the purchase of the replacement properties within 180 days of the sale of their initial property.

1031 Exchanges can be very complicated and you should consult with your CPA and Attorney before proceeding with an exchange.

Can I invest if I do not currently own a 1031 eligible property?

Yes. “Cash Investors” are investors who use non-1031 money to invest in a 1031 eligible deal. Once they have completed their investment, those investment funds become 1031 eligible and can be used as part of a 1031 exchange in the future.

 




Sponsor – Raise Equity



What is the process to raise equity through RealtyMogul.com?

The process is online and the application can be accessed here. You’ll be asked a series of questions about your firm, the specific transaction and other relevant details. From there, a RealtyMogul.com representative will be in contact to initiate the process and work through due diligence with you.

How much equity can be raised through RealtyMogul.com?

RealtyMogul.com focuses on small balance equity raises, ranging from $1 million to $5 million.

What types of properties can I raise funds for on RealtyMogul.com?

Cash-flowing commercial real estate of most major property types across the United States, including but not limited to, multi-family, office, industrial, retail, mobile home parks, self-storage, and hospitality. We do not currently raise funds for any ground up development, residential real estate, or owner occupied real estate.  We are currently looking for diversified, multi-tenant, well located, cash flow producing properties.

What types of sponsors does RealtyMogul.com work with?

Real estate companies that have at least $25 million in acquisition experience as principal. However, sponsors are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 

Does RealtyMogul.com run background, criminal and credit checks?

Yes, RealtyMogul.com requires background, criminal and credit checks for sponsors as part of our due diligence process.

How are investments structured?

RealtyMogul.com’s investors invest as a single limited member into the joint venture entity that owns the real property. All RealtyMogul.com investors are pooled into a special purpose vehicle, typically an LLC, and then RealtyMogul.com subscribes to the sponsor’s entity as a single investor. This means the sponsor is only responsible for one report, one distribution and one K-1. RealtyMogul.com processes all of the underlying reports, distributions and K-1s for our investors.

What reporting is required?

RealtyMogul.com requires quarterly qualitative and quantitative investor reporting.

Does the sponsor interact directly with individual investors?

Typically, the sponsor deals and interacts with RealtyMogul.com only, but in certain instances RealtyMogul.com will make direct introductions to the sponsor.

Does RealtyMogul.com require control rights?

Depending on how much equity the Realty Mogul LLC is investing, RM Manager, LLC, RealtyMogul.com's affiliated Exempt Reporting Advisor, may require some control rights or consent rights. We do require manager removal for gross negligence, fraud or other deceit.

How long does it take to fund a transaction?

Most transactions are funded within 45-60 days of submission.

Can a sponsor white-label the technology?

No, RealtyMogul.com does not currently have a white-label solution.

What is your deal approval process?

RealtyMogul.com has a two-stage approval process that involves a full underwriting of the investment and a tour of the asset.

What is the return profile of RealtyMogul.com's targeted investments?

RealtyMogul.com is a value-added investment partner generally targeting individual projects with a levered IRR objective of 15% or greater, and cash-on-cash yields at stabilization of 8% or greater. However, each deal is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Does RealtyMogul.com raise capital from non-accredited investors?

No. We only work with accredited investors.

Approximately how many equity transactions has RealtyMogul.com completed to-date?

RealtyMogul.com has raised approximately $70 million for approximately 55 joint ventures.

What type of equity does RealtyMogul.com provide?

RealtyMogul.com will invest as either pari-passu common equity, or as preferred equity where the common equity is subordinated.

Does RealtyMogul.com require sponsors to invest their own equity into their transactions?

Yes. We typically require sponsors to co-invest 10% of the total equity requirement of a transaction.

Who is North Capital?

RealtyMogul.com is aligned with North Capital Private Securities Corp. (NCPS), a broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC and many RealtyMogul.com employees are also affiliated with North Capital. All equity raises are done through North Capital.

 




Borrower – Raise Debt



What is the process to get a loan?

To apply for a loan, start the application process here. You’ll be asked a quick series of questions about the property and you. Our propriety technology then will screen your application and if found to be suited, one of our account executives will reach out to discuss further details and provide you with a quote.

What types of loans does RealtyMogul.com offer?

RealtyMogul.com offers loans for acquisition and refinance of commercial properties like apartments, office, retail, industrial, self-storage, mixed use, and more.
We offer three main loan products:

Private “Hard” money loans: 1-2 year term, $0.5-10 million, full recourse, interest only at 9%+. Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.
Bridge loans: 2-5 year term, $3-50 million size, non-recourse, interest only at Libor +4-7%. Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.
Permanent loans: 5-10 year term, $1-50 million size, non-recourse, interest only at market rate.  Please note that rates and terms are subject to change.


What types of properties does RealtyMogul.com lend on?

RealtyMogul.com lends on single and multi-tenant office buildings, manufactured home communities, multifamily and student housing, anchored and unanchored retail buildings, industrial, warehouse and flex properties, self-storage facilities, and mixed use properties.

Is it the same as borrowing from a traditional bank or private lender?

While we make loans similar to a traditional or private lender, our online systems and technology are designed to enhance the process and provide capital throughout the full capital stack.

How do borrowers benefit?

Borrowers benefit from competitive interest rates, a quicker and more transparent underwriting process, flexibility in product offerings and loan structures.

What rates do you charge?

We offer competitive interest rates but they are subject to a variety of factors including property location, loan size, and experience of the borrower.  For CMBS loans, we charge market rates.  For bridge loans, we are typically priced between Libor + 4% to Libor + 7%.  For private money loans, we typically charge 8-12%.

What states do you lend in?

All except NV, AZ, ND, SD, TN, MN, VT.

How long does the process take and what does it include?

Although this is determined on a case-by-case basis, we aspire to fund within 30-45 days from application submission. The process typically includes an in-house underwriting, third party reports review, site visit, documentation and legal review.

Where does the money to make the loans come from?

The majority of our loans are sold to institutional investors who we have defined relationships or joint venture agreements with.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

In addition, Bank of America or its Affiliates, their shareholders, directors, officers and/or employees, may from time to time have long or short positions in such securities or in options, futures or other derivative instruments based thereon.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
