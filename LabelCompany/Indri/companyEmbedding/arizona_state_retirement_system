 ASRS Legislative News 
 June 9, 2017 
  The 53rd Legislature – First Regular Session, adjourned on May 10, 2017. The Arizona State Retirement System had five legislative initiatives pass into law. They all have relatively minor impact to members and retirees, mainly clarifying language in existing state statutes.Below is a brief summary. You can also follow these and other retirement-related bills throughout the legislative session on our ASRS Bill Tracker.  

 New Trustees appointed to ASRS Board 
 May 5, 2017 
  Eight individuals have been appointed or reappointed to the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) Board of Trustees. Appointments are made by the Governor and confirmed by the State Senate.Previously serving appointees are: Tom Manos, former County Manager of Maricopa County; Kevin McCarthy, president of the Arizona Tax Research Association, and Clark Partridge, State Comptroller with the Arizona Department of Administration. 

 Ruling changes ASRS compensation definition regarding employer-paid deferred comp payments 
 April 21, 2017 
  On March 23, 2017, in the case of Wade and Paddock v. ASRS (No. CV-16-0087-PR), the Arizona Supreme Court held that employer-paid contributions on behalf of an employee to a tax qualified deferred compensation plan – such as a 457 or 401(k) – are compensation and therefore require ASRS contributions.Employee-paid contributions into these plans have always been considered compensation for ASRS purposes. This ruling adds employer-paid contributions are compensation as well.

 Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout myASRS Secure Account AccessI registered online a while ago, but can't get back in. What do I do?We have a quick and easy process for you to reset your password and/or unlock your account! Click on “Having Trouble Logging In?” link right here and follow the steps to verify your identity. We have added a new security feature to further secure member accounts, which includes using a third-party provider to assist us in verifying your identity.Then, using the email address or mobile phone number we already have on file for you, our system will send you an unlock code that you can use to reset your password.Having Trouble Logging In?What are these new questions I am being asked when I try to do something online?An increased security measure has been added to some online functions to help protect the safety of your retirement funds. When you try to perform some functions on the secure myASRS website, you will be asked to answer additional authenticating questions to verify your identity before continuing the process. They are similar to questions asked when you request an online credit report. The authenticating questions are presented and managed by a leading third-party provider, not the ASRS, in a safe and secure manner embedded within the transaction process. The ASRS has no visibility to questions or answers.This security measure will further enhance the ASRS’ ability to protect our members’ retirement accounts from fraud.If for any reason the ASRS could not authenticate you after you answered the questions, you can try again as part of the "Having Trouble Logging In?" process.Having Trouble Logging In?Can the ASRS let me skip or bypass these extra questions?No. ASRS staff cannot allow you to bypass the online authentication questions when they are presented. They are there for your protection and for the protection of your ASRS retirement funds.We do understand that a very small portion of members cannot answer the questions and/or the third party vendor cannot identify you based on the information provided. In that case, contact us and we can help answer your questions or perform your requested action through a different method.But I never registered before. How do I register for the first time?Registration for secure access to your ASRS retirement account, via myASRS, is easy! Just click this link below to get started. Once you verify your identity, you can manage all aspects of your ASRS retirement account right there at your fingertips.First Time RegisteringWhy would I want to register for secure access to my ASRS account?With secure access, you can track your retirement account and benefits throughout your entire career and into retirement. Prior to retirement, you can see contribution history and a variety of benefit estimates, all with real-time data based on the latest contributions reported by your employer. After retirement, you can view and update beneficiaries, taxes, direct deposit, health insurance coverages and working after retirement elections. All benefit recipients can view and download their payment history and annual 1099s as well.Find a complete list of online functions here:Why Register?About Login Confirmation Emails from ASRSWhy did I just get an email that I logged in?The ASRS has a new security feature to notify members when they access their private, secure myASRS account using their login information. This feature sends a confirmation email to the email address on file each time the account is accessed. The email clearly tells you to call the ASRS if you did NOT just log in.This is a great way to control for unauthorized access to your private myASRS account!But I didn’t log in, yet this email says I did! Is there a problem?Yes, generally that is a problem. You should contact us as soon as possible.However, if you have provided your complete login information to a third party, such as an online financial service that aggregates all of your account balances in one convenient place, it may have been THAT service that accessed your account using the credentials you provided them. These sites generally check all of your accounts at least once per day. You will receive a login confirmation email from the ASRS every time one of these third parties accesses your account.The ASRS does not recommend sharing your login credentials with any person or service. You are allowing these third parties complete access to your myASRS account, not just your ASRS contributions or pension amount, which could potentially put you and others at risk.I don't want to stop using that service. What can I do?If you continue to use the third party service, you will continue to receive login notifications from the ASRS each time they access your account on your behalf. There is no need to contact us.Please be aware that the ASRS is a defined benefit retirement system. Your "balance" at any given time is simply a reflection of your mandatory contributions into a future monthly retirement benefit.The account balance is not indicative of funds available to you on an as-needed basis, and so can be misleading if aggregated alongside other, more-accessible funds.Please review our website under the ‘Members’ tab for further description of ASRS benefits.About your 1099-R Tax StatementWhen will I receive my 1099-R?1099Rs for the prior fiscal year are mailed by the end of January. Printable copies of the 1099R are available in your myASRS secure account by mid-February.What if I never get the 1099-R? Or, if I lose it?A printable image of your 1099-R(s) for the prior tax year will be available in your myASRS account by February 15 of the current year. Just log in to your secure myASRS account and click on the 1099 link on the left-hand navigation.Why did I receive more than one 1099-R?We are required to send you a 1099-R for each combination of payment type and distribution code. Under any of several scenarios, you may have received more than one kind of payment from the ASRS.Also, if you turned 59.5 in the past year, you will receive more than one 1099-R. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers age 59.5 to be a factor in determining whether retirement income paid to an individual is considered an “early” or a “normal” distribution. As a result, we are required to send you two 1099-R forms for the year you turned 59.5. One will report income and taxes paid prior to age 59.5, and the other will be for the remainder of the year after reaching age 59.5.Is Box 5 on my 1099-R the amount of my out-of-pocket health insurance premiums?No. The amount you see in Box 5 is the portion of your retirement pension that is not subject to taxation. If you contributed to the ASRS prior to July 1986 or purchased service credit using after-tax payments, those contributions cannot be taxed again when disbursed as part of your retirement pension. The IRS requires the non-taxable contributions be spread over the life of your pension, so every year you will see a non-taxable amount in Box 5 until those contributions are exhausted.Where can I find my total out-of-pocket health insurance premium?For those retirees whose premiums are deducted from their ASRS pension, you can view your total out-of-pocket health insurance costs for the previous tax year by logging in to your secure myASRS account. Go to 'Payment History' and select the appropriate tax year (for example, "2016") to see a summary with year-to-date totals.For more on taxes, and how to read your 1099R, click here:Tax InformationTo log in to your myASRS account, click here:myASRS LoginAbout your Tax WithholdingsI want see my current withholdings from my ASRS pension or survivor benefitYou can view your current withholding elections by selecting 'Taxes' from the left-hand menu in your myASRS secure account.myASRS LoginHow do I change my withholdings?While viewing the 'Taxes' page on your secure myASRS account, you can update the elections and click the 'Submit' button.

You can also enroll within 30 days of experiencing a Qualifying Life Event such as losing coverage elsewhere, including termination of COBRA coverage, or becoming Medicare eligible.What is the Premium Benefit? As part of your benefits, the ASRS provides a health insurance premium benefit to supplement the cost of retiree health insurance. Retirees with five or more years of credited service who have health insurance through the ASRS or their former employer are eligible for a monthly premium benefit, which is paid to the health insurer or your former employer. For more information visit the Retiree Health Insurance Premium Benefit Program  page on our website.For more on healthcare, check out our pages dedicated to healthcare:HealthcareAbout Health Insurance Open EnrollmentWhen will I receive my Open Enrollment packet?Open Enrollment for 2017 begins October 24, 2016.

You do not need to take any action if you are already enrolled in ASRS insurance and want your coverage to carry over to 2017.For more on Open Enrollment:Open Enrollment InformationAbout RetirementDo I really have to wait 3 months to get a payment when I retire? Retirement processing can take 60 to 90 days. To ease the transition from regular employment to retirement, the ASRS issues up to 3 estimated payments to eligible members during processing. The first estimated payment is issued within 10 business days of the retirement date. Lump Sum payments are not disbursed until the retirement is fully processed. You can follow the progress of your retirement processing by logging in to your myASRS account, then click on 'Pending Requests'.myASRS LoginWhy is the first check smaller than the benefit estimate I received? While your retirement is being processed, “estimated” payments to eligible members are conservative in order to reduce the potential for overpayment. Any underpaid benefits will be disbursed retroactive to your retirement date once the processing has been completed.My account says that my processing has been completed. When will I get paid and how much will I receive?You will receive your first regular annuity payment no later than the 15th of the following month. We will send a detailed letter to you during the first week of that month to explain the final gross annuity amount and how it was calculated. The first annuity payment will cover the current month retroactive to your retirement and include adjustments for any estimated payments received during processing. After your retirement is finalized, all future payments will be issued on the 1st of every month for your lifetime. You can follow the progress of your retirement processing by logging in to your secure myASRS account, and clicking on 'Pending Requests'.myASRS LoginDo I need a form to update my Tax Withholding or Direct Deposit information?No. You can easily update tax withholding and direct deposit information through your secure myASRS account. Log in, then click on the appropriate link to view and then (as needed) update your elections. Once you save the changes, you will receive a message that confirms when the change will go in to effect.How do I schedule an appointment with an advisor? Call our office. We have Senior Benefit Advisors taking calls, leading group meetings, answering secure messages and meeting with members. For a meeting on pension benefits, an appointment is required. For a meeting strictly on health or dental insurance, no appointment is needed.For more on retirement, check out our pages dedicated to retirement:Retirement CentralAbout RefundingHow do I get a refund of my account?Log into your account, go to “Apply Now”, click on “Refund”. If you request funds to be paid directly to you, a mandatory 20% is withheld for federal tax, 5% for state tax. You will need to enter your bank’s routing number and account number for funds paid to you. If you request a rollover, provide the qualified plan’s name, account number and address where a rollover check can be received. Rollovers are not subject to tax withholding or penalty.How long does it take to receive my refund? If a refund is requested within 6 months of ending your job, we request an Ending Payroll Verification (proof of termination). If it has been years since you contributed, we may request proof of identity from you as a security measure. Once all required information is received, the refund is processed within 15 business days.Why does the payment date for my refund keep on changing?Our system generates a date that is approximately 15 days out to give you an idea of when to expect payment. If other information is required, such as an Ending Payroll Verification, the date will be pushed forward since processing cannot continue until all required information has been received.For more on refunds, check out our page dedicated to refunding:RefundingAbout Survivor BenefitsI am a retiree. How much money will my survivors receive if I pass away? Survivor benefits are determined by your retirement election. Log in to your secure myASRS account and click "Benefit Details" to view your elections, as well as an estimate of survivor benefits remaining as of today. If you elected a Joint-and-Survivor benefit, the dollar amount of that benefit is shown on the page. If you elected a Straight Life Annuity or Term Certain, this section will detail whether any benefits remain.I am a survivor. What is the status of my survivor benefits? Survivor benefit payment processing can take approximately 2 to 6 weeks depending on whether the deceased member was an active employee or retired. We must have all required documents from the beneficiary, such as the notarized Survivor Benefit Application, original certified death certificate, a photocopy of the beneficiary’s Social Security card, and proof of the beneficiary’s age, in order to process payment.For more on survivor benefits, check out our page:Survivor Benefits Secure Message  Have a question about your account that we can answer by safe, secure message?

Estimate Your Benefits











Chart Demo
	














Step 1: Learn the calculation
The formula to calculate a retirement is quite simple.
Total Service Credit * Graded Multiplier * Average Monthly Compensation = Monthly Benefit
Use this simple tool to calculate a Straight Life Annuity option. This tool does not use any of your personal information. It gives you an idea of how the formula works and how the benefit changes as your age, compensation, and service credit increase. Have some fun with it!


	When did you first start contributing to ASRS?
 Before 7/1/2011   
	 After 7/1/2011


Use the sliders to adjust the Estimated Benefit




Average monthly compensationAge at retirement










 









Note: red bars indicate an 'early retirement' reduction factor has been applied.
Service Credit
The more service you have accrued, the higher your retirement benefit. The ASRS credits service based on reported contributions from your ASRS-covered employers. Make sure all 
           contributions have been reported by logging in to your secure account, and clicking 'Balances' under My Account. Service is awarded in the month in which contributions are reported to us, 
           not necessarily in the month you worked.
Graded Multiplier
As you accrue more service, you qualify for a higher multiplier of your final average monthly compensation, which increases your benefit.

Average Monthly Compensation
The ASRS calculates your eligible compensation based contributions paid into your account, which are a percentage of your regular salary each pay period.     
The method used to calculate your average monthly compensation is based on when you became an ASRS member.
Compensation
Retirement Central
 There is so much more to retirement than the basic ASRS benefit calculator. Find out how to leave benefits to a beneficiary, how health insurance and taxes impact your take-home benefit, how you can afford to retire and so much more in our dedicated section called 'Retirement Central'.

Step 2: Log in to get YOUR estimate
Log in to see your personalized estimate, including your latest projected retirement date and other retirement options such as term certain and survivor annuities, partial lump sum and health insurance premium benefits. When logged in, you can also view personalized benefit estimates for refund, long term disability, service purchase and survivor benefits.
Once logged in, click 'Retirement' under 'Your Benefit Estimates' to check and customize your own personalized estimate.

Wage Replacement Rates
The longer you work and accrue service credit, the closer your retirement benefit is to your final monthly salary. Multiplying your Years of Service by the appropriate multiplier will provide you 
            with the percentage of your average monthly compensation that will be paid as a monthly retirement benefit.

As the table demonstrates, even if you spend a full career in public service, your retirement benefit will only be a fraction of the wages you received while working.  In fact, the ASRS was 
           designed to be only one of three savings methods used by public employees to save for retirement, with social security and personal savings being the other two forms of retirement 
           savings.


Frequently Asked Questions


When can I retire?
Any member can retire at 65 years old, but you can retire with a reduced benefit as early as 50 years old as long as you have 5 years of service credits. Any retirement prior to "normal retirement" - determined by your membership date - has a reduction factor applied to ensure that total benefits paid over your lifetime do not exceed those paid if you had waited until normal retirement. 

Retirement Eligibility

Once you have reviewed the requirements for Retirement Eligibility, Log In to your account to view and customize your own personalized estimate.



Should I refund now, or should I wait to retire?
Once you log in, you can see customized estimates of both your refund benefit and your retirement benefit. Review each number carefully, and read the explanations and disclaimers attached to each. Generally, a lifetime benefit is worth more money over time than a one-time lump sum benefit, but each decision is up to you. If you want to talk to someone about your options, feel free to Contact Us


Can I invest more money toward retirement than just my contributions?
Statute does not allow for members to contribute more than the actuarially determined rate toward your defined benefit, but many ASRS employers provide supplemental retirement savings programs for their employees.  The ASRS also provides employers with access to supplemental retirement savings programs to help you Supplement Your Retirement.

What happened to the old estimator?
We still have that estimator! After logging in and viewing the 'My Benefit Estimates -> Retirement' link, you can hit the 'customize' button to see all the various retirement options and tabs for customizing the benefit estimate to meet your needs. However, to ensure you are starting with solid data (service years and monthly compensation, as known by ASRS), we require you to access this function after logging in. Retirement is an incredibly important decision, one that should be made with the best possible information at the start.

Retirement










 Eligibility and Compensation RulesThere are rules for retirement eligibility and what salary (or, compensation) is eligible for use in the calculations. Click the button to learn more.EligibilityThe Basic Calculation - Straight Life AnnuityWhile there is a lot to learn, the ASRS is a defined benefit plan which means that the formula to calculate an annuity (monthly pension) is quite simple. Total Service Credit * Graded Multiplier * Average Monthly Compensation (AMC) = Monthly Benefit That's it. The graded multiplier determines the percentage of your AMC you will receive for each year of service credited to your account. Learn more about the formula and create personalized benefit estimates on the “Estimate Your Benefits” page by clicking this button.Try the calculatorStraight Life AnnuityThe basic monthly benefit is something called a Straight Life Annuity (SLA). The SLA is the most money you can receive per month, but it does not guarantee any benefits to your survivors after your death.Other Annuity OptionsThere are 6 additional options to choose from when you apply for your pension. All the options will pay you (the retiree) a monthly benefit for life. If you want to leave benefits to your spouse or anyone else after your death, you might want to choose one of the other options.Retirement Annuity OptionsClick the picture below to learn the difference between the various benefit options in a self-paced, interactive eLearning.Other ConsiderationsOf course, while the formula is simple, there are other things to consider when you're thinking about retirement.Partial Lump Sum (PLS): You are allowed to take a lump sum advance on some of your retirement funds in exchange for a lower monthly benefit. Log in to estimate your benefits, and click 'customize' to experiment with different PLS options.Early Retirement: You can retire with a reduced lifetime benefit as early as 50 years old with 5+ years of service. Experimenting with different retirement dates in the 'Retirement' link under 'Your Benefit Estimates' on the secure site will show you how the reductions are applied. You still might decide that the extra years of benefits will offset the lifetime reduction.Health Insurance: When you retire, you will need health coverage and you may be eligible for a subsidy called a 'premium benefit'. Look at our Health Insurance section of the website for more details.HealthcareName your beneficiary(ies): Designating your beneficiary(ies) is very important, and makes survivor benefit processing that much faster. Read more on our beneficiaries page, including the need to designate your spouse as primary beneficiary or obtaining spousal consent to designate otherwise.Choosing BeneficiariesService Purchase: If you are in the process of purchasing service, or you have a Payroll Deduction Agreement in progress, read through the Service Purchase page including the Frequently Asked Questions before filing for retirement.Service PurchaseAdditional Information: The ASRS is a retirement system after all with benefits other than retirement, such as survivor benefits and a Long Term Disability plan. Read over the entire website for all of the benefits you have, and the details about those benefits. When you log in to the secure site, we will show you YOUR customized estimates of each type of benefit.Log in to Estimate Benefits and File for RetirementBy logging in, you can see a customized benefit estimate just for you. You can run different customized scenarios, such as the various annuity options, PLS options and health insurance premium benefits.When you are ready to retire, we encourage you to use our online retirement application to file for retirement. Using our online application is virtually error free and we take you through all the various options to make sure you haven’t missed anything to avoid delay in processing your benefits.myASRS Login Why Register?For a look at the big picture of Retirement - before, during and after filing - check out our dedicated section called 'Retirement Central'Retirement Central Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy should I file online, rather than by the paper form?Because when you fill out paper, it's too easy to make a mistake. The Online Retirement application is easy and explains every decision along the way so you understand exactly what's going to happen with your benefit. The process is designed like popular tax software that keeps a running tally of your elections and the impact on your estimated benefit.What if I have Service Purchase in progress?Purchasing service to enhance your retirement can be a complicated process. The ASRS strongly encourages you to work with an advisor to make sure all payment timelines are met so that your retirement is calculated correctly and not delayed. A paper application is required if you plan to pay off your payroll deduction agreement using partial lump sum (only for PDA’s established before 1/6/2013). For more, read the 'Frequently Asked Questions' section of the Service Purchase page.Service PurchaseHow do I know what annuity option to choose?Choosing a retirement option is a very personal choice. We encourage you to discuss with your spouse, family, and/or financial advisor and decide what your needs are. The basic option is a Straight Life Annuity which provides the highest payout per month but does not guarantee a benefit to your survivors after death. Watch the video on Annuity Options to learn the details of each option which will help you decide. The Online Retirement process also details the various options, and provides estimates of the impact to your benefit with each option.If I take a Partial Lump Sum (PLS) up front, does that delay my monthly benefits?No, but there are some considerations. Your monthly benefits are effective beginning on your retirement date, regardless of whether you take a PLS advance. But by taking an advance in a lump sum, your monthly benefit is reduced for your lifetime to offset the advance of PLS. And, while monthly benefits begin on your retirement date, PLS advances take up to 90 days after your retirement date to finalize before payment is made.How will I check the status on my retirement?Once you file your application, you can check the status of your retirement at any time under the 'Pending Requests' link in your secure account. The table will detail each pending document, if any additional documents are required, and will provide estimated dates for payment. Once the your retirement calculation has been completed (60-90 days), the first payroll date will show as finalized.Why is the first check smaller than the benefit estimate I received?While your retirement is being processed, “estimated” payments to eligible members are conservative in order to reduce the potential for overpayment. Any underpaid benefits will be disbursed retroactive to your retirement date once the processing has been completedDo I need a form to update my Tax Withholding or Direct Deposit information?When you file for retirement using the Online Retirement application, you will make those elections at the same time. No separate forms are required. If you file your retirement application by paper, then the tax and direct deposit forms must be filled out as well. After retirement, you can easily update tax withholding and direct information through your secure account. Log in, click on “Payment History”, then click on the appropriate link at the top of the payment listing to “View/Update Tax Withholding Elections” or “View/Update Direct Deposit Information”. After you submit your changes, you will receive a message that confirms when the change will go in to effect.How do I schedule an appointment with an advisor?Call our office. We have Senior Benefit Advisors taking calls, leading group meetings, answering emails and meeting with members. We first encourage you to attend a group meeting - either online or in person - to learn more about the basics of retirement and to speak to an advisor before or after the session. For a one-on-one meeting on pension benefits, an appointment is required. To meet with an insurance representative regarding health or dental insurance, no appointment is needed.

Rules










 Arizona Administrative CodeThe Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the state of Arizona are published. The Code is the official compilation of rules that govern state agencies, boards and commissions. The Arizona State Retirement System is responsible for ensuring that all ASRS rules, five-year-review reports and substantive policy statements meet statutory requirements and are clear, concise and understandable. ASRS official rules are published in the Arizona Administrative Code, and can be found in Title 2, Administration, Chapter 8, State Retirement System Board, of the Code. The Secretary of State provides an on-line version of the Code at: Arizona Administrative CodePlease be aware that Arizona Administrative Code is only updated every three months, and that newer rules may be in effect than the ones published in the Code. Below is the ASRS Regulatory Agenda for calendar year 2016 and 2017.  Regulatory Agenda - 2017 Regulatory Agenda - 2016Information on RulesExplanation of RulesGenerally speaking, a rule is an administrative law that is created by a government entity to clarify requirements the agency imposes on the public based on a statute that allows the agency to regulate certain activities.According to the Arizona Revised Statutes, a rule is "an agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency. Rule includes prescribing fees or the amendment or repeal of a prior rule but does not include intra-agency memoranda that are not delegation agreements." A.R.S. § 41-1001(19).Explanation of Substantive Policy StatementsAccording to the Arizona Revised Statutes, a substantive policy statement is “a written expression which informs the general public of an agency's current approach to, or opinion of, the requirements of the federal or state constitution, federal or state statute, administrative rule or regulation, or final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, including, where appropriate, the agency's current practice, procedure or method of action based upon that approach or opinion. A substantive policy statement is advisory only. A substantive policy statement does not include internal procedural documents which only affect the internal procedures of the agency and does not impose additional requirements or penalties on regulated parties, confidential information or rules made in accordance with this chapter.” A.R.S. § 41-1001(22).In other words, substantive policy statements are filed with the Secretary of State in order to provide notice to the public about how an agency handles certain legal requirements, but substantive policy statements do not impose additional requirements on the public. Currently, the ASRS does not have any substantive policy statements on file with the Secretary of State.ASRS Rules ProceduresThe rulemaking process is the way government entities may create rules. There are four basic types of rulemaking: regular, exempt, emergency and expediated. The ASRS generally follows the regular rulemaking process, located in the Arizona Administrative Procedures act outlined in A.R.S 41-1001 through 41-1057.Those procedures require various documents to be filed with the Secretary ofState and the Governor's Regulatory Review Council. The following documents must be filed in this order:Notice of Docket Opening (NDO) - To inform the public that the agency is planning to change or add to its rules.Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) - To inform the public of how the agency is going to change or add to the rules and allow a miniumum of 30 days for public comment.Notice of Final Rulemaking (NFR) - To inform the public of how the agency has changed or added to the rules.These documents are part of the rulemaking record and are available for public inspection at the ASRS Phoenix office.Rulemaking MoratoriumBefore engaging in the rulemaking process, the ASRS must obtain approval from the Governor’s Office for each specific rulemaking. Governor Doug Ducey instituted a rulemaking moratorium in Executive Order 2017-02 that will expire on December 31, 2017. The rulemaking moratorium requires most state agencies to seek approval from the Governor's Office before proceeding with rulemaking actions. The ASRS complies the Executive Order and seeks approval from the Governor’s Office before proceeding with any rulemaking actions. If the agency does not obtain approval from the Governor’s Office to proceed with the specific rulemaking, the agency cannot engage in the rulemaking process for that particular rulemaking.Public ParticipationThere are multiple opportunities for members of the public to participate in and comment on the rulemaking process. Members of the public are welcome to contact the ASRS at any time to comment on exisitng rules. The public may also participate on proposed rules through written and oral comments. The ASRS schedules an Oral Proceeding for each rulemaking that is open to the public for comment. Oral Proceedings on ASRS proposed rules are generally held at the ASRS Phoenix office, and noticed on this page, under the Rules Under Development column.For information or to comment on ASRS rules, please contact ASRS Rules Writer, Jessica Thomas, at [email protected] (Please note: Correspondence to and from this or other ASRS email addresses is subject to public disclosure under the Arizona Public Records Law.)Additional ResourcesArizona Administrative CodeThe Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the state of Arizona are published. Please be aware that updates are published every three months and newer rules may be in effect.Arizona Administrative RegisterThe Arizona Administrative Register is the official publication for tracking rulemaking actions from concept to completion. It is published regularly by the Secretary of State.Secretary of StateThe Secretary of State is the official publisher of the Arizona Administrative Code and the Arizona Administrative Register. The Secretary of State does not interpret or enforce administrative rules.Governor's Regulatory Review CouncilThe Governor's Regulatory Review Council (GRRC) is a council of seven members appointed by the Governor to review agency rulemakings and Five-year Review Reports. Before submitting a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Secretary of State for publication in the Arizona Administrative Register, an agency must obtain approval from GRRC. The council meets twice a month.Required NoticesAbility to PetitionA person may petition the ASRS and/or the Governor’s Regulatory Review Council to review an agency rule or agency practice, pursuant to A.R.S. § 41-1033.  To submit a petition to the Governor’s Regulatory Review Council, visit the council’s website. To submit a petition to the ASRS, contact Jessica Thomas at [email protected].  Input Needed for "Regulation Rollback"A new rulemaking initiative called "Regulation Rollback" is being implemented by the Governor's Office and your input is needed. "Regulation Rollback" is a strategic step in the Governor's ongoing work to make Arizona the best state in the nation for businesses and consumers alike. However, a lot of work still needs to be done to make sure outdated rules aren't slowing Arizona down.Read on for more details and how to submit your suggestions.

Rules










 Arizona Administrative CodeThe Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the state of Arizona are published. The Code is the official compilation of rules that govern state agencies, boards and commissions. The Arizona State Retirement System is responsible for ensuring that all ASRS rules, five-year-review reports and substantive policy statements meet statutory requirements and are clear, concise and understandable. ASRS official rules are published in the Arizona Administrative Code, and can be found in Title 2, Administration, Chapter 8, State Retirement System Board, of the Code. The Secretary of State provides an on-line version of the Code at: Arizona Administrative CodePlease be aware that Arizona Administrative Code is only updated every three months, and that newer rules may be in effect than the ones published in the Code. Below is the ASRS Regulatory Agenda for calendar year 2016 and 2017.  Regulatory Agenda - 2017 Regulatory Agenda - 2016Information on RulesExplanation of RulesGenerally speaking, a rule is an administrative law that is created by a government entity to clarify requirements the agency imposes on the public based on a statute that allows the agency to regulate certain activities.According to the Arizona Revised Statutes, a rule is "an agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency. Rule includes prescribing fees or the amendment or repeal of a prior rule but does not include intra-agency memoranda that are not delegation agreements." A.R.S. § 41-1001(19).Explanation of Substantive Policy StatementsAccording to the Arizona Revised Statutes, a substantive policy statement is “a written expression which informs the general public of an agency's current approach to, or opinion of, the requirements of the federal or state constitution, federal or state statute, administrative rule or regulation, or final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, including, where appropriate, the agency's current practice, procedure or method of action based upon that approach or opinion. A substantive policy statement is advisory only. A substantive policy statement does not include internal procedural documents which only affect the internal procedures of the agency and does not impose additional requirements or penalties on regulated parties, confidential information or rules made in accordance with this chapter.” A.R.S. § 41-1001(22).In other words, substantive policy statements are filed with the Secretary of State in order to provide notice to the public about how an agency handles certain legal requirements, but substantive policy statements do not impose additional requirements on the public. Currently, the ASRS does not have any substantive policy statements on file with the Secretary of State.ASRS Rules ProceduresThe rulemaking process is the way government entities may create rules. There are four basic types of rulemaking: regular, exempt, emergency and expediated. The ASRS generally follows the regular rulemaking process, located in the Arizona Administrative Procedures act outlined in A.R.S 41-1001 through 41-1057.Those procedures require various documents to be filed with the Secretary ofState and the Governor's Regulatory Review Council. The following documents must be filed in this order:Notice of Docket Opening (NDO) - To inform the public that the agency is planning to change or add to its rules.Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) - To inform the public of how the agency is going to change or add to the rules and allow a miniumum of 30 days for public comment.Notice of Final Rulemaking (NFR) - To inform the public of how the agency has changed or added to the rules.These documents are part of the rulemaking record and are available for public inspection at the ASRS Phoenix office.Rulemaking MoratoriumBefore engaging in the rulemaking process, the ASRS must obtain approval from the Governor’s Office for each specific rulemaking. Governor Doug Ducey instituted a rulemaking moratorium in Executive Order 2017-02 that will expire on December 31, 2017. The rulemaking moratorium requires most state agencies to seek approval from the Governor's Office before proceeding with rulemaking actions. The ASRS complies the Executive Order and seeks approval from the Governor’s Office before proceeding with any rulemaking actions. If the agency does not obtain approval from the Governor’s Office to proceed with the specific rulemaking, the agency cannot engage in the rulemaking process for that particular rulemaking.Public ParticipationThere are multiple opportunities for members of the public to participate in and comment on the rulemaking process. Members of the public are welcome to contact the ASRS at any time to comment on exisitng rules. The public may also participate on proposed rules through written and oral comments. The ASRS schedules an Oral Proceeding for each rulemaking that is open to the public for comment. Oral Proceedings on ASRS proposed rules are generally held at the ASRS Phoenix office, and noticed on this page, under the Rules Under Development column.For information or to comment on ASRS rules, please contact ASRS Rules Writer, Jessica Thomas, at [email protected] (Please note: Correspondence to and from this or other ASRS email addresses is subject to public disclosure under the Arizona Public Records Law.)Additional ResourcesArizona Administrative CodeThe Arizona Administrative Code is where the official rules of the state of Arizona are published. Please be aware that updates are published every three months and newer rules may be in effect.Arizona Administrative RegisterThe Arizona Administrative Register is the official publication for tracking rulemaking actions from concept to completion. It is published regularly by the Secretary of State.Secretary of StateThe Secretary of State is the official publisher of the Arizona Administrative Code and the Arizona Administrative Register. The Secretary of State does not interpret or enforce administrative rules.Governor's Regulatory Review CouncilThe Governor's Regulatory Review Council (GRRC) is a council of seven members appointed by the Governor to review agency rulemakings and Five-year Review Reports. Before submitting a Notice of Final Rulemaking to the Secretary of State for publication in the Arizona Administrative Register, an agency must obtain approval from GRRC. The council meets twice a month.Required NoticesAbility to PetitionA person may petition the ASRS and/or the Governor’s Regulatory Review Council to review an agency rule or agency practice, pursuant to A.R.S. § 41-1033.  To submit a petition to the Governor’s Regulatory Review Council, visit the council’s website. To submit a petition to the ASRS, contact Jessica Thomas at [email protected].  Input Needed for "Regulation Rollback"A new rulemaking initiative called "Regulation Rollback" is being implemented by the Governor's Office and your input is needed. "Regulation Rollback" is a strategic step in the Governor's ongoing work to make Arizona the best state in the nation for businesses and consumers alike. However, a lot of work still needs to be done to make sure outdated rules aren't slowing Arizona down.Read on for more details and how to submit your suggestions.

Supplement Your Retirement










 What You Will Need to RetireThe ASRS Defined Benefit Plan provides for a guaranteed lifelong monthly benefit to retirees.There are, however, no provisions in the plan for automatic benefit increases, such as a Cost of Living Adjustment, after retirement.By statute, the purpose of the ASRS is to “Provide a base retirement benefit that is less than 100 percent of a member’s post-retirement income requirements” (A.R.S. § 38-712). Separate post-retirement income from Social Security, individual retirement plans such as a 401(k), and personal savings are vital for members to build a more complete and diverse retirement portfolio.Think of your retirement plan as a three-legged stool. How sturdy is yours?Your ASRS BenefitThe average ASRS benefit payment is approximately $1,630 a month, or about $19,500 per year.Based on recent ASRS demographics, the average retiree’s benefit provides about 40 percent of what they were earning before retirement. Again, there are no provisions to provide for annual cost of living adjustments to your base benefit.Social SecurityMost all ASRS members also participate in the federal Social Security plan. The average Social Security benefit is approximately $1,269 per month, or about $15,200 per year. Social Security does have provisions for providing cost of living increases, predicated upon Congressional approval.Personal SavingsA supplemental retirement savings plan is an excellent opportunity for members to save during their working careers for their post-retirement years. The ASRS offers several supplemental saving plans for employers to participate in and offer to their employees.Additionally, anyone may set up a tax-deferred savings plan though a bank or qualified financial institution.The ASRS encourages members to consult a trusted tax advisor or financial planner for information.ASRS Supplemental Savings PlansOpening a secondary but separate retirement account from your ASRS benefit is an effective way to help provide for a more secure retirement. Even if you can only contribute a small amount now, opening such a plan early in your career will help set a more solid foundation for a well-diversified retirement portfolio.The ASRS offers several separate, voluntary plans to participating employers, who may then offer the option to their employees. Members may wish to explore these separate defined contribution plans.ASRS Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan (SRSP)The ASRS SRSP is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The SRSP allows eligible members to contribute tax-deferred money into an account that can be drawn upon in retirement.ASRS members are eligible to participate in this plan only if their employer signs up for the plan. This plan is not available to employees of the State of Arizona and the state universities, which have access to similar programs through the Arizona Department of Administration.Due to the distinctive features and benefits of the SRSP, the Internal Revenue Service requires restrictions that are unique to other tax-deferred plans.

Investments










 Investment ManagementThe financial health of the ASRS depends on our ability to generate optimal returns from our investments while minimizing risk. This assures the security of retirement benefits and helps keep down the ongoing funding costs to our employers and active members. As a result, the following are the ASRS investment goals:Maximize the fund rate of return for acceptable levels of fund risk.Achieve a 75th percentile rate of return compared to peers.Achieve long-term fund rates of return equal to or greater than the actuarial assumed interest rate.Achieve long-term economic and actuarial funded statuses of 100 percent.Mitigate contribution rate volatility.Asset AllocationKey Investment DocumentsRates of ReturnInvestment Program ReportsASRS Investment StaffHistorical Annualized Rates of Return (Net of Fees)Fiscal YearReturn2015-160.6%2014-153.2%2013-1418.6%2012-1313.1%2011-121.3%2010-1124.6%2009-1014.6%2008-09-18.1%2007-08-7.6%2006-0717.8%Frequently Asked Questions - Market ImpactsWhat impact does a volatile stock market have on the ASRS?The ASRS is invested in nearly all sectors of the market, including the major indexes. When the markets go up, the ASRS fund increases; when the markets go down, so does the ASRS fund. The ASRS total fund has fluctuated from approximately $25 billion in September 2008 prior to the steady market decline began, down to $17 billion in March 2009, and is currently at approximately $33 billion.What impact do market fluctuations have on members?ASRS members participate in a defined benefit plan. Member benefits are determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and average salary at the time of retirement. The ups and downs of the stock market do not affect the level of your retirement benefit, as it would with a defined contribution plan, such as a personal 401(k) plan. For retired members, their monthly lifetime benefit is guaranteed not to decline despite what the markets or the ASRS total fund may do at any given time. However, prolonged down markets make it difficult for the ASRS to accumulate excess funds used to fund the Permanent Benefit Increase program. That benefit, also defined in state statute, provides for an increase to retirees' monthly benefits only when excess earnings are sufficient to generate such an additional benefit. For active members, prolonged down markets that lead to multiple years of rates of return below the ASRS assumed earnings rate of 8 percent will put upward pressure on contribution rates. For inactive members who have an account balance with the ASRS but are no longer making contributions because they are no longer employed by a participating employer, their accounts continue to accrue interest at the rate of 8 percent. (For withdrawal of contributions only, however, interest applied will vary dependent upon the dates contributions were received.).Where does the ASRS have investments and have you made changes based on the current state of the markets?The ASRS manages a well-diversified portfolio that is designed to produce returns over a long period of time. This institutional investment approach relies primarily on an asset allocation strategy that does not radically change due to market conditions. See the ASRS Strategic Asset Allocation Policy above for more details. There are, however, opportunities to shift funds to take advantage of market conditions. For example, the ASRS has:Tactically committed and invested capital to non-U.S. Treasury securities (trading at attractive historical yields).Through our Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) sector, we have marginally reduced over-weighting in equities and commodities, reallocating to other opportunities.Continued to analyze markets for other opportunistic investments.Why not make bolder moves? Why not shift assets out of the financial sector, for example?Timing the markets to produce a steady return is difficult, if not impossible. Consider this: From 1997 through 2011, the Dow Jones Industrial Average produced an annualized return of 6.63% for those who stayed fully invested in the fund. Missing the 10 best days produced a return of 1.97%, and missing the 20 best days produced a return of -1.05%.Should I be worried about my retirement savings?Obviously, market conditions affect us all. During these volatile times, the ASRS will continue to closely monitor investments and make adjustments when prudent, but will continue to take a long-term approach to investing. It is in such times that members can be particularly reassured as participants in a defined benefit plan that is supported by a professionally managed, well-diversified portfolio that benefits are guaranteed, and not tied to any account balance that may go up or down. Funds used to pay benefits come into the Retirement System through member and employer contributions, and from investments. Although the market value of the ASRS fund will fluctuate, as will the markets in general, there are sufficient funds to meet current benefit obligations.Can the ASRS collapse, as has been seen in the banking industry? What guarantee do I have that my retirement funds are safe?Benefits to ASRS members are guaranteed by the Arizona Constitution, which states that the "assets of public retirement systems, including investment earnings and contributions, are separate and independent trust funds" to be used solely for the benefit of members and beneficiaries, and that benefits "shall not be diminished or impaired."

 Frequently Asked QuestionsAbout myASRS Secure Account AccessI registered online a while ago, but can't get back in. What do I do?We have a quick and easy process for you to reset your password and/or unlock your account! Click on “Having Trouble Logging In?” link right here and follow the steps to verify your identity. We have added a new security feature to further secure member accounts, which includes using a third-party provider to assist us in verifying your identity.Then, using the email address or mobile phone number we already have on file for you, our system will send you an unlock code that you can use to reset your password.Having Trouble Logging In?What are these new questions I am being asked when I try to do something online?An increased security measure has been added to some online functions to help protect the safety of your retirement funds. When you try to perform some functions on the secure myASRS website, you will be asked to answer additional authenticating questions to verify your identity before continuing the process. They are similar to questions asked when you request an online credit report. The authenticating questions are presented and managed by a leading third-party provider, not the ASRS, in a safe and secure manner embedded within the transaction process. The ASRS has no visibility to questions or answers.This security measure will further enhance the ASRS’ ability to protect our members’ retirement accounts from fraud.If for any reason the ASRS could not authenticate you after you answered the questions, you can try again as part of the "Having Trouble Logging In?" process.Having Trouble Logging In?Can the ASRS let me skip or bypass these extra questions?No. ASRS staff cannot allow you to bypass the online authentication questions when they are presented. They are there for your protection and for the protection of your ASRS retirement funds.We do understand that a very small portion of members cannot answer the questions and/or the third party vendor cannot identify you based on the information provided. In that case, contact us and we can help answer your questions or perform your requested action through a different method.But I never registered before. How do I register for the first time?Registration for secure access to your ASRS retirement account, via myASRS, is easy! Just click this link below to get started. Once you verify your identity, you can manage all aspects of your ASRS retirement account right there at your fingertips.First Time RegisteringWhy would I want to register for secure access to my ASRS account?With secure access, you can track your retirement account and benefits throughout your entire career and into retirement. Prior to retirement, you can see contribution history and a variety of benefit estimates, all with real-time data based on the latest contributions reported by your employer. After retirement, you can view and update beneficiaries, taxes, direct deposit, health insurance coverages and working after retirement elections. All benefit recipients can view and download their payment history and annual 1099s as well.Find a complete list of online functions here:Why Register?About Login Confirmation Emails from ASRSWhy did I just get an email that I logged in?The ASRS has a new security feature to notify members when they access their private, secure myASRS account using their login information. This feature sends a confirmation email to the email address on file each time the account is accessed. The email clearly tells you to call the ASRS if you did NOT just log in.This is a great way to control for unauthorized access to your private myASRS account!But I didn’t log in, yet this email says I did! Is there a problem?Yes, generally that is a problem. You should contact us as soon as possible.However, if you have provided your complete login information to a third party, such as an online financial service that aggregates all of your account balances in one convenient place, it may have been THAT service that accessed your account using the credentials you provided them. These sites generally check all of your accounts at least once per day. You will receive a login confirmation email from the ASRS every time one of these third parties accesses your account.The ASRS does not recommend sharing your login credentials with any person or service. You are allowing these third parties complete access to your myASRS account, not just your ASRS contributions or pension amount, which could potentially put you and others at risk.I don't want to stop using that service. What can I do?If you continue to use the third party service, you will continue to receive login notifications from the ASRS each time they access your account on your behalf. There is no need to contact us.Please be aware that the ASRS is a defined benefit retirement system. Your "balance" at any given time is simply a reflection of your mandatory contributions into a future monthly retirement benefit.The account balance is not indicative of funds available to you on an as-needed basis, and so can be misleading if aggregated alongside other, more-accessible funds.Please review our website under the ‘Members’ tab for further description of ASRS benefits.About your 1099-R Tax StatementWhen will I receive my 1099-R?1099Rs for the prior fiscal year are mailed by the end of January. Printable copies of the 1099R are available in your myASRS secure account by mid-February.What if I never get the 1099-R? Or, if I lose it?A printable image of your 1099-R(s) for the prior tax year will be available in your myASRS account by February 15 of the current year. Just log in to your secure myASRS account and click on the 1099 link on the left-hand navigation.Why did I receive more than one 1099-R?We are required to send you a 1099-R for each combination of payment type and distribution code. Under any of several scenarios, you may have received more than one kind of payment from the ASRS.Also, if you turned 59.5 in the past year, you will receive more than one 1099-R. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers age 59.5 to be a factor in determining whether retirement income paid to an individual is considered an “early” or a “normal” distribution. As a result, we are required to send you two 1099-R forms for the year you turned 59.5. One will report income and taxes paid prior to age 59.5, and the other will be for the remainder of the year after reaching age 59.5.Is Box 5 on my 1099-R the amount of my out-of-pocket health insurance premiums?No. The amount you see in Box 5 is the portion of your retirement pension that is not subject to taxation. If you contributed to the ASRS prior to July 1986 or purchased service credit using after-tax payments, those contributions cannot be taxed again when disbursed as part of your retirement pension. The IRS requires the non-taxable contributions be spread over the life of your pension, so every year you will see a non-taxable amount in Box 5 until those contributions are exhausted.Where can I find my total out-of-pocket health insurance premium?For those retirees whose premiums are deducted from their ASRS pension, you can view your total out-of-pocket health insurance costs for the previous tax year by logging in to your secure myASRS account. Go to 'Payment History' and select the appropriate tax year (for example, "2016") to see a summary with year-to-date totals.For more on taxes, and how to read your 1099R, click here:Tax InformationTo log in to your myASRS account, click here:myASRS LoginAbout your Tax WithholdingsI want see my current withholdings from my ASRS pension or survivor benefitYou can view your current withholding elections by selecting 'Taxes' from the left-hand menu in your myASRS secure account.myASRS LoginHow do I change my withholdings?While viewing the 'Taxes' page on your secure myASRS account, you can update the elections and click the 'Submit' button. The system will make those new elections effective in the next available payroll cycle, and will confirm that effective date with you.myASRS LoginAbout Contacting UsHow can I reach the ASRS?The ASRS has a small call center open 8 AM to 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM to 5 PM Monday through Wednesday and 8 AM to 11:30 AM and 12:30 PM to 4 PM Thursday and Friday, excluding holidays. You can also send us a secure message at any time of day or night, and except a complete response within 1-3 business days.

If you are having trouble finding the information you’re looking for, be sure to try the Search function (upper right on every page).

Those on ADOA or ASRS-provided health insurance can see any active or pending medical and dental insurance coverages, including net costs, in their myASRS secure account. Just log in and select the 'Medical/Dental Insurance Details' link.myASRS LoginCan I get insurance later if I don’t choose to enroll when I retire? Retirees and members receiving Long Term Disability (LTD) benefits receive an Open Enrollment packet each year, for coverage to begin the following January 1. You can also enroll within 30 days of experiencing a Qualifying Life Event such as losing coverage elsewhere, including termination of COBRA coverage, or becoming Medicare eligible.What is the Premium Benefit? As part of your benefits, the ASRS provides a health insurance premium benefit to supplement the cost of retiree health insurance. Retirees with five or more years of credited service who have health insurance through the ASRS or their former employer are eligible for a monthly premium benefit, which is paid to the health insurer or your former employer. For more information visit the Retiree Health Insurance Premium Benefit Program  page on our website.For more on healthcare, check out our pages dedicated to healthcare:HealthcareAbout Health Insurance Open EnrollmentWhen will I receive my Open Enrollment packet?Open Enrollment for 2017 begins October 24, 2016.

Find out more here.New Non-Medicare PlansAdditionally, there will be no changes to the Dental programs in 2017.Do I have to submit the enrollment form if I don’t want to make changes?No. This is a passive open enrollment period. You do not need to take any action if you are already enrolled in ASRS insurance and want your coverage to carry over to 2017.For more on Open Enrollment:Open Enrollment InformationAbout RetirementDo I really have to wait 3 months to get a payment when I retire? Retirement processing can take 60 to 90 days. To ease the transition from regular employment to retirement, the ASRS issues up to 3 estimated payments to eligible members during processing. The first estimated payment is issued within 10 business days of the retirement date. Lump Sum payments are not disbursed until the retirement is fully processed. You can follow the progress of your retirement processing by logging in to your myASRS account, then click on 'Pending Requests'.myASRS LoginWhy is the first check smaller than the benefit estimate I received? While your retirement is being processed, “estimated” payments to eligible members are conservative in order to reduce the potential for overpayment. Any underpaid benefits will be disbursed retroactive to your retirement date once the processing has been completed.My account says that my processing has been completed. When will I get paid and how much will I receive?You will receive your first regular annuity payment no later than the 15th of the following month. We will send a detailed letter to you during the first week of that month to explain the final gross annuity amount and how it was calculated. The first annuity payment will cover the current month retroactive to your retirement and include adjustments for any estimated payments received during processing. After your retirement is finalized, all future payments will be issued on the 1st of every month for your lifetime. You can follow the progress of your retirement processing by logging in to your secure myASRS account, and clicking on 'Pending Requests'.myASRS LoginDo I need a form to update my Tax Withholding or Direct Deposit information?No. You can easily update tax withholding and direct deposit information through your secure myASRS account. Log in, then click on the appropriate link to view and then (as needed) update your elections. Once you save the changes, you will receive a message that confirms when the change will go in to effect.How do I schedule an appointment with an advisor? Call our office. We have Senior Benefit Advisors taking calls, leading group meetings, answering secure messages and meeting with members. For a meeting on pension benefits, an appointment is required. For a meeting strictly on health or dental insurance, no appointment is needed.For more on retirement, check out our pages dedicated to retirement:Retirement CentralAbout RefundingHow do I get a refund of my account?Log into your account, go to “Apply Now”, click on “Refund”.

Arizona State Retirement System


The Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS) was created to provide retirement and other benefits for Arizona employees. It includes faculty, and employees of the state's political subdivisions who signed membership contracts. Maricopa Community Colleges is a Plan employer of the Arizona State Retirement System and all employees of MCCCD become members of the System once eligibility requirements are satisfied.

Employees are required to make contributions to the ASRS Plan if they work for twenty hours or more per week for twenty weeks or more in a fiscal year.
For Faculty, one load hour is equivalent to two clock hours.

Arizona State Retirement contributions will automatically be deducted from your paychecks. The state retirement withholding rate may change each fiscal year. Rates can be found on the ASRS web site.
Once an employee starts making contributions to the Plan, the employee becomes a "member" and begins earning credited service. Maricopa Community Colleges as a Plan employer will match the employee's contributions.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
