Jean-Claude Kihn appointed president of Goodyear’s EMEA business
Dec 2, 2015 | People
 

Jean-Claude Kihn has been named president of Goodyear’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business. Currently the president of Goodyear’s Latin America business, Kihn will fully assume his new role on January 1, 2016.  He succeeds Darren R. Wells, who will leave the company in early 2016.

“Jean-Claude is a well-rounded executive with leadership experience in all of our regions and every aspect of our operations,” said Goodyear chairman and CEO Richard J. Kramer in a company press release adding : “As Goodyear’s chief technical officer, he led our technology and innovation progress and was responsible for research, development, engineering, and quality worldwide.  He also has managed our Latin America strategic business unit, and has excelled at building customer relationships.  We believe Jean-Claude is the right leader to take our EMEA business to the next level of performance.”
Kihn, 56, joined Goodyear in 1988 as an engineer in the company’s technical center in his native Luxembourg.  A member of Goodyear’s senior leadership team since 2008, he has served as chief technical officer, senior vice president and managing director of Goodyear Brazil, and most recently, president of the company’s Latin America business unit.      
Goodyear is one of the world’s largest tire companies. It employs approximately 66,000 people and manufactures its products in 49 facilities in 22 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry.

Article excerpt

I joined Goodyear at the Innovation Center in Luxembourg as someone responsible for the development of rubber compounds. A few years later, I got an assignment in a Goodyear plant in Thailand, where I got my first manufacturing experience. This was extremely interesting; when you are developing tires or compounds and you see how your work affects the work of others, it is a very informative experience.
In 2003 I got an opportunity to become the managing director of Goodyear Peru. When I was the managing director in Peru, we had a supply problem. It took us a long time to get tires to where they were needed, even though those tires were in production and, very often, even in the warehouse. At about that time, I went to a conference and saw a video of a lean simulation exercise in manufacturing. That was really a revelation for me. I could see that it might be exactly what we needed to solve our problems in getting the tires to our customers faster.
When I saw the results, I thought, "This would work extremely well for our product development process and for R&D." In R&D, cycle times are much longer-getting tires to a customer is something that takes days or weeks, whereas developing a new product takes a year or two. If we could apply the same lean principles that worked in logistics to product development, it would give us a huge advantage.
When I came back to Akron as the head of the Innovation Center, we started using lean principles to improve product development. We saw our results significantly improve. We had previously had an on-time delivery rate of about 30 percent, and the projects that were late were late by weeks and sometimes months. We are now at 90 percent on-time delivery, with 10 percent that are late by a few days or a few weeks. The results can be summarized in a few seconds, but it took us years of effort to apply lean principles to our product development problems.
Lean thinking is not natural. It is counterintuitive, and it is countercultural. …

Dec 4, 2015 | 









Jean-Claude Kihn has been named president of Goodyear’s Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business. Currently the president of Goodyear’s Latin America business, Kihn will fully assume his new role on January 1, 2016.  He succeeds Darren R. Wells, who will leave the company in early 2016.

“Jean-Claude is a well-rounded executive with leadership experience in all of our regions and every aspect of our operations,” said Goodyear chairman and CEO Richard J. Kramer in a company press release adding : “As Goodyear’s chief technical officer, he led our technology and innovation progress and was responsible for research, development, engineering, and quality worldwide.  He also has managed our Latin America strategic business unit, and has excelled at building customer relationships.  We believe Jean-Claude is the right leader to take our EMEA business to the next level of performance.”
Kihn, 56, joined Goodyear in 1988 as an engineer in the company’s technical center in his native Luxembourg.  A member of Goodyear’s senior leadership team since 2008, he has served as chief technical officer, senior vice president and managing director of Goodyear Brazil, and most recently, president of the company’s Latin America business unit.
