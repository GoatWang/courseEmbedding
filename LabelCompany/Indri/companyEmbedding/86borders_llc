In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

What we do/Mission


Platform as a Service

			Communication and visibility are two words that sum up
			the philosophy of 86Borders. Our services are robust, unique, and
			almost without limit. By leveraging the cutting edge WebRTC protocol
			we provide video, chat, voice, screen sharing, and location based
			information directly through your web browser. No installation
			required. 
		

			86Borders allows for incredible customization of its services
			to accommodate virtually any user. Create a profile just like any
			popular social media service, or streamline the process by using an
			existing LinkedIn profile to automatically register. Then create,
			join, or manage any number of groups for whatever purpose they need:
			business or personal. Furthermore, make groups within groups so that
			members can be subdivided into increasingly specific categories.
		

			Simply put, 86Borders is a Platform as a
			Service (PaaS). On top of our platform for managing groups, we
			provide business grade applications, like 
			86EnRoute
			, that work on every
			device. These applications can be subscribed to or purchased for
			individuals or entire groups. In this users have their own personal
			applications, and they have access to programs that are available to
			groups of which they are members.
		

			Our applications are known as widgets
			because they are self-contained, fully-functional programs that move
			between devices. These widgets can interact with each other to
			enhance effectiveness and increase productivity. For example, the
			data generated from one widget can be analyzed in a different widget.
			Each widget has its own purpose and can be acquired depending on
			need. Additionally, the suite of widgets used by organizations and
			individuals is fully customizable.
		




			86Borders takes the simple, the complex, and everything in
			between and seamlessly blends it all into one single platform. We
			unify the disparate and expand possibility. This is the source of our
			system's vast potential. By offering a blend of so many services in
			one package, 86Borders can accommodate any customer's needs.

FAQ


What are groups and how are they used?

			Groups are just that, a collection of people
			put together who share a common interest or purpose. Within
			86Borders, you can create a group and add anybody to it. In this way,
			you can keep people arranged however you want. You have the ability
			to group people based on how you interact with them. They can be a
			part of your personal life, your professional life, or both! Organize
			anything from a world wide company down to the local little league
			team. Enhance major business processes or send out a reminder to the
			new social group (like a tennis club or school organization) you just
			created.
		


What are widgets?

			86Borders is a PaaS that uses widgets.
			Widgets are self-contained, fully-functioning applications that work
			on every device and utilize any available information those devices
			offer. They work congruently to provide data, statistics and reports.
			Widgets can be added to your personal home page or to a group.
		



			What is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) and
			how does it relate to 86Borders?
		

			A Platform as a service (PaaS) is a
			category of cloud computing services that allow customers to develop, run,
			and manage web applications without the complexity of building and
			maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing
			and launching an app.
			
			86Borders (hosted by Amazon's AWS) is a PaaS
			because we provide the necessary tools to build your own widgets or
			use the ones we've already made and distribute them to the necessary
			individuals. The Directory Service and widget data is in the cloud
			and we always know who should have access to what widget. Therefore,
			you can access your programs from whatever device whenever you need
			them.
		


How can 86Borders increase the efficiency of my workflow?


				With 86Borders you can collect everything in one centralized location, keep contacts organized into groups,
				and access widgets according to those groups. 86Borders allows disparate entities to connect seamlessly.
			


				With the right set of widgets, both publicly available or company specific, a group administrator can define
				and manage a unique organizational workflow. Such workflows can help to pass documents and information
				between group members, entire groups, or unaffiliated parties. The widgets involved can help not only with
				routing and managing workflow, but also with the presentation of information.
			


				86Borders provides a variety of APIs to give custom widgets access to relevant information about groups and
				group members, thus enhancing functionality by providing communication capabilities, visibility, and robust
				group member routing.
			



What is WebRTC?

WebRTC is an open
			project that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time
			Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC
			components have been optimized to best serve this purpose. The WebRTC
			initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera,
			amongst others. 86Borders uses WebRTC to bring you lightweight
			communication tools (like voice, video, chat, and screen sharing)
			without having to download any new software.
		


Does 86Borders enable communication between users and non-users?
 
			Yes. In addition to providing seamless
			internal communication, 86Borders makes communicating with external
			contacts equally convenient.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS
Life threatening bleeding can occur from emergency situations in our communities everyday. From vehicle crashes and incidents involving farming equipment or public transportation to accidental injuries from natural disasters like tornadoes or inflicted injuries from intentional acts of violence like shootings and bombings, uncontrolled bleeding can result in death within minutes – even before emergency medical services or other emergency responders can arrive. These first minutes following a traumatic injury are crucial in saving a life.
North American Rescue is leading the way to equip bystanders and initial first responders with the essential medical gear needed to take immediate action in life threatening emergencies.These lifesaving modular aid components are designed for individuals or groups in public buildings and populated public areas to administer immediate bleeding control at the point of wounding.
Prepare yourself and your communities for the unexpected – lives are depending on it…

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.
