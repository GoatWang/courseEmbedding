(NYSE MKT: ROX), a developer and international marketer of premium and super-premium brands, today announced an agreement to supply Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer and      Goslings Stormy Diet Ginger Beer to all U.S. Walmart stores. Consumers can expect to find Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer in Walmart stores in March 2017. In addition to its uses as a stand-alone soft drink and as a mixer, Goslings Stormy        Ginger Beer and Goslings Black Seal Rum combine to make the trademarked Dark n' Stormy ® Cocktail.     John Glover, Chief Operating Officer of Castle Brands said, "Supplying Walmart with both the Regular and Diet Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer adds to the brand's impressive growth and strengthens our position in the U.S. market. We are            pleased that Walmart has implemented a full store roll-out.  We look forward to working with Walmart to promote the continued success of Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer."     Malcolm Gosling, President of Goslings-Castle Partners Inc., a global export venture between Castle Brands and the Goslings said, "The agreement with Walmart, the world's largest retailer, to supply approximately 4,500 stores with Goslings    Stormy Ginger Beer, which we believe is the largest selling U.S. premium ginger beer, is an indication of the strength and growing value of the Goslings brand."     B) Unannounced Distribution Deal: Goslings Ginger Beer can be found in 270 ShopRite Supermarkets in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania    5) Financial Benchmarks:     A) ROX fiscal 2017 Year End 10K (Click here or copy and paste to browser): https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1311538/000149315217006635/form10-k.htm     B) The first GAAP black Quarter was Fiscal Q4 2016 ending 03/31/2016          The second GAAP black Q was Fiscal Q3 2017 ending 12/31/2016          The third GAAP black Q was Fiscal Q4 2017 ending 3/31/2017 (that marks the first time ever that ROX has posted consecutive GAAP black quarters)     C) The net loss attributable to common shareholders was the smallest ever in fiscal 2017          (2013) ... $(6,193)         (2014) ... $(9,291)         (2015) ... $(3,800)         (2016) ... $(2,517)         (2017) ... $(853)      D) ROX is trending towards being GAAP black on an annual basis in fiscal 2018. That's NOW.         ROX is currently in it's 1st fiscal Q of 2018.     E) Gross profit is increasing:         2012 = 35.3%         2013 = 34.5%         2014 = 36.6%         2015 = 37.5%         2016 = 39.5%         2017 = 41.0%     F) EBITDA turned from loss to growing profit:         2012 = ($4,591,165)         2013 = ($4,803,961)         2014 = ($7,959,287)         2015 = ($484,156)         2016 = $962,532         2017 = $5,222,989    G) Revenues have more than doubled in 5 years:          Fiscal 2012 = $35,494,615  (for the year ending on March 31, 2012)          Fiscal 2017 = $77,269,131  (for the year ending on March 31, 2017)      H) Inventories are increasing:         March 31, 2012 inventory = $10.733 million         March 31, 2017 inventory = $29.801 million      I) Reason for increasing inventories:         Trey Zoellar's marketing efforts and Jeffersons's great tasting 11 unique bourbon extensions are directly responsible for Jefferson's growing reputation for fine quality products worthy of higher price points.          The shortfall of its aged and blended bourbons of it's 8 unique extensions has resulted in some distributors nationwide needing to supply some stores with just one case at a time, until they could be restocked themselves.          The more whiskey and bourbon Castle Brands can distill and age in it's own distilleries and warehouses (and at sea), for future sales and consumption years down the road, means they have more control over product consistency,                      assurance of availability, and it will lower the cost-of-goods on future income statements while increasing profit margins.         Each year going forward Castle Brands will be better able to satisfy consumer demand through more retail outlets, which can be supplied by more domestic and international distributors.     J) During the 2017 fiscal year, the Company purchased approximately 3,600 barrels of aged bourbon and laid down approximately 6,400 barrels of new fill.  6) ROX Investor Presentation highlights (Click here or copy and paste to browser): https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1311538/000119312517079461/d337241dex991.htm      Page 4 highlights a 14.1% gross profit increase for the 12 months ended 12-31-16 YoY, and that's on top of a 9.1% revenue increase YoY.       Page 5 highlights an annual net loss of only $0.6 million. That's the smallest ever, and for the prior comparable YoY period, it's a reduction from an annual loss of $3.6 million. That's fantastic progress.       EBITDA increased from $2.6 million to $4.5.       BIG NEW INVESTOR PRESENTATION STATEMENT:       Page 7 announces "Goslings Stormy Ginger Beer soon available in all 4,500 U.S. Walmart stores.       In the introduction to Jefferson's Bourbon: Note between pages 8 & 9 is the picture of our extensions. Be aware the picture doesn't include the Presidential or Rye extensions. It also doesn't contain the "Wood Experimental" package of 5-200     MLs bottles which is still on store shelves. Hopefully ROX is aging some bourbon to reintroduce the very high priced 21 year old Presidential. ROX also previously announced the purchase of RYE stock. Let's hope ROX reintroduces the RYE     extension.       Page 11 is very important because it shows the really big name companies and their Small Batch Bourbons with only 4 selling more than Jefferson's. Moreover ROX jumped ahead of Jack Daniels Single Barrel.       Page 13 shows a brand new Jefferson's print advertisement.      Page 17 shows Goslings will have an America's Cup Television campaign.  (Click here or copy and paste to browser to view the commercial): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDs_Tni3iKA      Page 20 shows Knappogue and Clontarf together sold over 48,000 cases for the full year in comparison to 42,000 in 2015.  7) ROX has great Guerilla Marketing and Award Winning products:      * Goslings is the official rum of the Boston Red Sox     * Goslings sponsors several USA World Cup Alpine ski race weekends each winter.     * Goslings is an official America's Cup sponsor, also a sponsor of 5 PGA and LPGA tour championships, of the World Rugby Classic in Bermuda, of the annual Fort Lauderdale International Boat Show, and Louis Vuitton         America's Cup World Series * * * *Japan https://www.facebook.com/events/551189241758897/      * The Goslings Invitational      https://www.facebook.com/events/586276161575316/     * Knappogue Castle Crowned 'Irish Whiskey of the Year 2016'     http://www.hospitalityireland.com/knappogue-castle-crowned-irish-whiskey-year-2016/33894     * Big win in the big easy!

Southern Wine and Spirits.       2. Glazers.       3. United Liquors.        Also in July while that occurred Southern Wine and Spirits and Glazers completed their merger and became Southern Glazer's Wine and Spirits.        Southern Glazer’s is the largest North American wine and spirits distribution company, distributing more than 150 million cases of wine and spirits annually, and employing more than 20,000 team members with operations in 44 states plus          the District of Columbia, the Caribbean, and Canada.        Our new distributors according to the corporate presentation dated 7 Sept 2016 are       1. Southern Glazers Wine and Spirits.       2. United Liquors.       3. RNDC-USA. (New)       4. Breakthru Bev. (New)        Here's more about RNDC-USA.

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.

Investacorp, Inc., an independent broker-dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida, has been serving the independent registered representative community since 1978 and has approximately 440 independent financial advisors nationwide. The firm was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in October 2007.[10]

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Investacorp, Inc.[edit]
Investacorp, Inc., an independent broker-dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida, has been serving the independent registered representative community since 1978 and has approximately 440 independent financial advisors nationwide. The firm was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in October 2007.[10]
Triad Advisors, Inc.[edit]
Triad Advisors, Inc., was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in August 2008.[11] The firm was founded in 1993, and is a independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor headquartered in Norcross, Georgia that offers a broad menu of products, services and total wealth management solutions through approximately 590 independent financial advisors nationwide.
Premier Trust, Inc.[edit]
Founded in 2001, Premier Trust, Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in September 2010.[12] It is a Nevada-chartered trust company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, with assets under management of approximately $530 million.
Securities America Inc.[edit]
Securities America Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann from Ameriprise Financial in November 2011 for $150 million in cash and potential future payments.[13] The firm was founded in 1993 and has headquarters in La Vista, Nebraska. The firm is a SEC-Registered investment advisory firm that offers investment management, financial advice and financial planning through a national network of independent financial advisors. It is the nation's seventh largest independent broker-dealer (as ranked by Financial Planning magazine, June 2011, based on 2010 total revenue). The firm received the inaugural Thought Leadership Award from the Retirement Income Industry Association in March 2011.

Our Story
Harnessing a History of Growth and Success to Support Today’s Independent Financial Advisor:
Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services Inc. (NYSE MKT: LTS) is a leading innovator of the network model in the independent broker-dealer and advisory space. The firm draws on its illustrious financial services history to empower and strengthen its subsidiaries while embracing their unique cultures and identities, pooling their collective resources to meet the needs of mainstream American investors.
135-Year Heritage
In 2014, our investment banking business, Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., celebrated 135 years as a New York Stock Exchange member, the sixth oldest member on record.

People first
Our successful evolution into a diversified financial services company provides our network with the advantages of a large-scale organization while allowing them to maintain their firms’ unique cultures, core values and management teams. This approach gives our advisors the freedom to focus on building client relationships and helping investors face the often-intimidating tasks of financial planning, funding retirement, saving for children’s education, complex insurance needs and other crucial financial goals.
Commitment to individual’s affordable financial advice
Ladenburg Thalmann’s commitment to independent financial advice is reflected in CEO Richard Lampen’s role as Director of the Financial Services Institute, an advocacy group committed to providing all individuals with access to competent and affordable financial advice, products and services.
An Established Foundation
