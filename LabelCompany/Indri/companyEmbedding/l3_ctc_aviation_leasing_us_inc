L-3 Acquires CTC Aviation Group | Business Wire


























































L-3 Acquires CTC Aviation Group






May 28, 2015 08:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) announced today that on May 27, 2015 it 
      acquired UK-headquartered CTC Aviation Group, now known as L-3 CTC Ltd. 
      The purchase price is £143 million (approximately $220 million) and was 
      funded with cash on hand. The acquisition is expected to be immediately 
      accretive to L-3’s results of operations.
    


      L-3 CTC is a high-quality, global airline pilot training and crew 
      resourcing specialist that offers customized and innovative solutions to 
      major airlines and retail customers globally. This acquisition expands 
      L-3’s Commercial Aviation Training business, which also includes L-3 
      Link UK, a provider of world-class flight training simulation devices, 
      aftermarket solutions and training, to encompass a growing portfolio of 
      airline and third-party training company customers. L-3 CTC has 
      approximately 265 employees. L-3 CTC forecasts sales for the years 
      ending December 31, 2015 and 2016, of $86 million and $95 million, 
      respectively, and is expected to add approximately $50 million to L-3’s 
      sales for the year ending December 31, 2015. L-3 CTC is a high-margin 
      business that is expected to generate operating margins that generally 
      exceed those of the Electronic Systems segment as a whole.
    

      “This acquisition is a very good fit with our strategy of expanding our 
      international and commercial presence by focusing on higher-margin 
      businesses with number one or two positions in the markets we serve,” 
      said Michael T. Strianese, L-3’s chairman, president and chief executive 
      officer. “L-3 CTC has a worldwide reputation for excellence and 
      strengthens our Link Simulation & Training and Link UK businesses with 
      value-added synergies for total training solutions across a wide range 
      of military and commercial platforms. This addition will solidify L-3’s 
      position as a global leader in commercial flight simulation and 
      training, while delivering value to our customers and shareholders.”
    

      L-3 CTC and L-3 Link UK will retain their individual brands and 
      strengths as independent operational entities, while continuing to focus 
      on and serve their existing customers and markets. The synergistic 
      collaboration of these two businesses enables new and innovative 
      approaches to vertically integrated training, resourcing and simulation 
      solutions. The business portfolio will span the entire spectrum of 
      customer needs, delivering unique and innovative capabilities, an 
      unmatched value proposition, and a strong emphasis on customer service.
    

      “Driven by a focus on the customer, quality, service and safety, this 
      new partnership of world-class training devices and training delivery 
      places L-3 Link UK and L-3 CTC in the unique position to provide 
      customers with totally scalable training solutions whatever their 
      requirements,” said Alan Crawford, managing director of L-3 Link UK. 
      “This acquisition also enables L-3 to build on strategic partnerships 
      with key growth airlines in an environment where a global shortage of 
      pilot training resources and increased pilot demand are driving the 
      growing need for tailored pilot training solutions. We look forward to 
      working very closely with L-3 CTC to bring to our customers the unique 
      propositions that can only be delivered by a customer-focused training 
      and resourcing solutions company.”
    

      L-3 CTC will be integrated into the Precision Engagement & Training 
      sector, which is part of L-3’s Electronic Systems segment.
    

      Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 45,000 people 
      worldwide and is a prime contractor in aerospace systems and national 
      security solutions. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of 
      communication and electronic systems and products used on military and 
      commercial platforms. The company reported 2014 sales of $12.1 billion.

      L-3 uses its website as a channel of distribution of material company 
      information. Financial and other material information regarding L-3 is

Farnborough Air Show
General Aviation
CTC Acquisition Spurs L-3 to Address Pilot Shortage




by Bill Carey
 - July 12, 2016, 8:05 AM













 


L-3 Communications has formed a new Commercial Training Solutions division by combining simulator manufacturer L-3 Link UK and its airline pilot training organization, L-3 CTC Aviation.
L-3 Commercial Training Solutions is based in Crawley, UK, and includes L-3 CTC Private Jet. It offers commercial aviation training and services, including selection, ab initio training, resourcing and airline recurrent, type and command training, supported by high-fidelity simulation products.
Announced on July 7, the division was created to meet current and emerging market requirements and drive continued efficiencies, L-3 said.
“L-3 now offers a seamless, one-stop shop that provides customized and affordable solutions to support the global commercial aviation training marketplace,” said Steve Kantor, L-3 Electronic Systems president. “Given the global pilot shortage and the growing need for pilot training at all proficiency levels, we are now optimally positioned to serve this market with our technical expertise and leading innovative products and capabilities.”
CTC Aviation and Link UK have collaborated since L-3’s acquisition of CTC in May 2015. They established a training facility at Gatwick Airport outside of London that houses L-3 RealitySeven training devices for both Boeing and Airbus aircraft. The collaboration led to a partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to provide Boeing 787 training and CTC instructors using a Link UK RealitySeven full-flight simulator.
As a part of the consolidation, the training portfolio of Link UK has been aligned with CTC Aviation’s airline training business. This includes the Asian Aviation Training Center in Bangkok, Thailand, which was recently expanded from six to eight full flight simulators.
L-3 will be exhibiting an Airbus A350 RealitySeven flat panel trainer here at the show (Outside Exhibit 31). The first such FTP is destined for new A350 operator Cathay Pacific, which is based in Hong Kong.
