Baseball career[edit]
He was born in Voorhees, New Jersey and first played baseball at Paul VI High School in Haddonfield, New Jersey. He attended Wagner College in Staten Island. Bailey was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 16th round (475th overall) of the 2005 MLB draft, but decided to return to Wagner for his senior year and earn a degree in business administration. His Wagner number 17 jersey was retired in January 2010. He is only the fourth former student-athlete to be honored in that way.[1][2]
Oakland Athletics[edit]
Bailey was selected by the Oakland Athletics in the sixth round (188th overall) of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft. He made the Athletics Opening Day 25-man roster for the 2009 season as a long shot and made his major league debut on April 6, 2009, tossing a scoreless inning against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.[3] Bailey was selected to represent the Athletics in the 2009 MLB All-Star Game in St. Louis. He broke the Athletics rookie save record on September 12 against the Minnesota Twins with his 24th save of the season.
After a final line of 26 saves and a 1.84 ERA, Bailey was named 2009 American League Rookie of the Year on November 16, 2009.[4] He was selected again to the All-Star team in 2010, which he finished with 25 saves and a 1.47 ERA.
On September 12, 2011, Bailey was hit right above the temple by a line drive in batting practice. He felt fine, passed concussion tests, and sat out the next few days. He returned to action to face the Tigers a few games later.[5] His ERA ballooned to 3.24, although he did finish with 24 saves.
Boston Red Sox[edit]
On December 28, 2011, Bailey and Ryan Sweeney were traded from Oakland to the Boston Red Sox for Josh Reddick and two minor leaguers.[6] On April 4, 2012, it was announced that Bailey would require reconstructive surgery on his right thumb and that he would begin the 2012 season on the disabled list.[7] Bailey made his 2012 debut with the Red Sox on August 14, pitching a third of an inning in a loss to Baltimore. He finished the 2012 season with 15 1⁄3 innings pitched, a 7.04 ERA, and a 1.89 WHIP.
Bailey began the 2013 season as a middle reliever with the Red Sox, but when closer Joel Hanrahan was injured in mid-April, Bailey took over the closer job.[8] Bailey compiled 8 saves, a 3-1 record and a 3.77 ERA in 30 appearances until he suffered a shoulder injury that kept him from playing for the rest of the season. After the All-Star Break, MRIs confirmed there was a torn capsule and damaged labrum in his throwing shoulder. He underwent shoulder surgery on July 24, ending his 2013 season.[9] After the 2013 season, Bailey was non-tendered by the Red Sox, making him a free agent.[10]
New York Yankees[edit]
On February 22, 2014, Bailey signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees with a $2.5 million salary if he made the major league roster and a club option for the 2015 season.[9][11] After numerous setbacks in his recovery from his shoulder injury, Bailey was ruled out for the 2014 season on August 17.[12] The Yankees signed him to a new minor league contract on November 7, 2014, after declining his 2015 option a few days earlier.[3]
The Yankees promoted Bailey to the major leagues on September 1, 2015.[13] On September 2, 2015, he entered in the 7th inning at Boston: his first appearance in 2 years. In 10 appearances, he posted a 5.19 ERA. On November 3, 2015, the Yankees declined Bailey's option for the 2016 season, making him a free agent.[14]
Philadelphia Phillies[edit]
Bailey signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies in December 2015, receiving an invitation to spring training.[15] He was called up to the Phillies on April 20, 2016.[16] He was designated for assignment on August 2 and released on August 6.
Los Angeles Angels[edit]
On August 13, 2016, Bailey signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels. On November 9, Bailey signed a one-year, $1 million contract to remain with the Angels.[17]
Awards[edit]

2009 American League Rookie of the Year
2009 American League All Star
2010 American League All Star

Philanthropy[edit]
Bailey serves as Director of Development for the Strike 3 Foundation, a non-profit charity dedicated to pediatric cancer research, founded by former Athletics and Red Sox teammate Craig Breslow.[18]

Where the Dark Wolf Dreams
 
By Scott Bailey © 2014
 
A deep and dark filled cave
Upon a mountain high
Where no light dares enter
And no echo finds reply
Shallow
The dark wolf dreamsArumble from within
Deep in the dark wolves throat
The echo of the growl
The terrifying note
Fitfully
The dark wolf dreamsStrong appear the chains
That bind him in his sleep
But stronger still the anger
That grows within him deep
Brooding
The dark wolf dreams
Bitter is the dark wolf’s heart
Long his memory too
Some will be spared his wrath
But they are counted few
Grim
The dark wolf dreams
Terrible his waking hours
Thus the grey wolves grieve
Any heart with secrets dark
Had better rise and leave
Briefly
The dark wolf dreams
So do not be deceived
By the mumbling and the snoring
Born of rage and constriction
Of rending and of roaring
And of waking
The dark wolf dreams

Posted on Wed July 19 2017Tue May 9 2017 by Scott Andrew Bailey 


Earl
A bitter young aristocrat seeks revenge on the spirit that disinherited his father. Not all though is as his young eyes assume.

Thirteen Tales of Ghosts
By Scott Bailey
A collection of short stories concerning ghosts. Some are traditional ghost stories in the tradition of M.R. James and Edgar Allan Poe. Other are not. Some scare, some are fun. Some play with the concept of a ghost. There are ghosts who are out for revenge and the living avenging the spirits that curse them.
Ideal for sitting around a campfire and late at night under the covers. Or maybe not if the stories themselves are any guide.
Check it out at Amazon and Smashwords and other online e-book retailers.
A paperback version is now available for those who prefer the feel of the paper while huddling by the fire – on your own – in the dark – with that noise behind you……

About A Different Spectrum
I have always thought that I have viewed the world using a different spectrum. At one end I miss the things that are blindingly obvious to anyone else. At the other I see things that other miss. So my take on the world is a little askew - if not sometimes weird. So this blog reflects that. As do my works - my novel, my short stories and my poetry.
