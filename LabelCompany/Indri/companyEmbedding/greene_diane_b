Google Picks Diane Greene to Expand Its Cloud Business

Google is playing catch-up in the booming cloud computing market, well behind the early leader, Amazon. But on Thursday, Google made clear that it was ready to go on the offensive.The company said that Diane B. Greene, one of its board members, would now head its cloud business that caters to companies. Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and chief executive of the parent company, Alphabet, called her new post a “huge new responsibility at Google.”The selection of Ms. Greene is sure to make waves in Silicon Valley. The company’s focus and heritage has been mainly on online services for consumers, like search and email, supported by advertising. By placing Ms. Greene, a respected Silicon Valley entrepreneur and technologist, in charge of its corporate business, Google is signaling that it plans to move forcefully beyond its consumer roots.Ms. Greene is best known as co-founder and former chief executive of VMware, whose software for juggling many computing programs across many computers is widely used in corporate data centers. That kind of “virtual machine” software is one of the technologies that makes computing clouds efficient and relatively inexpensive.

The cloud business, analysts and executives say, is just getting underway. Sundar Pichai, Google’s chief executive, noted in an interview that only a tiny fraction of the world’s data was now in the cloud. Continue reading the main story

But Google, despite its technology prowess, has lagged the leaders, particularly in enterprise cloud computing. At the same time, analysts say, the company’s offerings in cloud development services — computing, storage, data analytics and others — are already comparable to Amazon’s.“Google is doing all these things, but it is not gaining enterprise mindshare,” said Eric Knipp, an analyst at Gartner. “It’s not pushing in the enterprise market as much as others.”Google says that 60 percent of the Fortune 500 companies use a paid Google cloud service, with email and online office documents being the most popular. The business has done well, Mr. Pichai said in the interview, though its performance is not broken out in Google’s financial statements.Yet the corporate business, he said, had developed largely as an “opportunistic” add-on to the consumer franchise. Mr. Pichai described Google’s corporate business a “journey that has organically evolved.”The elevation of Ms. Greene suggests organic evolution is no longer sufficient. Ms. Greene, Mr. Pichai said, is “someone who understands enterprise needs very well” and whose goal is to “help us achieve our potential” in the corporate cloud market.Ms. Greene, 60, is one of the most prominent women in the technology business and moves in the industry’s most elite circles. Her new title will be senior vice president for Google’s enterprise businesses, and she will remain on the Google board.

The big opportunity for Google and its competitors, analysts say, is in becoming the equivalent of an operating system for cloud computing, supplying underlying technology and programming tools for building business software. Nearly all new software applications are being written to be delivered over the Internet from computers in remote data centers, cloud-style.In late 2012, Ms. Greene founded a start-up, Bebop Technologies, to build a new software development technology for writing cloud applications. Along with appointing Ms. Greene, Google has agreed to buy Bebop, which had not publicly said anything about its technology, operating in so-called stealth mode. Mr. Pichai said only that Bebop was pursuing “a unique, ambitious approach” to cloud software development.

Leading technology companies all offer software platforms for creating cloud applications, including Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce, IBM and Google. The market for these cloud development tools is growing fast, to a projected $2.3 billion in 2019, up from $803 million this year, according to IDC.But the development tools market is more important for its strategic significance than for its size. The more that software developers build cloud apps using a company’s development tools, the more apps will run on its computing cloud. That market, IDC forecasts, will grow more than 30 percent a year, from $7.8 billion in 2015 to $22.6 billion in 2019.Ms. Greene, who has graduate degrees in naval architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley, was joined at VMware by her husband, Mendel Rosenblum, a computer science professor at Stanford. Part of Mr. Rosenblum’s research formed the technological basis for VMware, which was founded in 1998.In December 2003, growing at a torrid pace, VMware agreed to be acquired by EMC for $635 million in cash. At the time, Ms. Greene viewed EMC as a safe corporate parent, known for acquiring companies and giving them operating freedom. It also gave many of VMware’s original employees, who had stayed with the company through the lean times of the bursting of the tech-stock bubble in 2001 and its aftermath, a handsome payday.For a while, VMware thrived as part of EMC. In 2007 EMC sold 15 percent of VMware to the public and gave it a separate stock listing, so Wall Street could invest in the fast-growing subsidiary. But Ms. Greene clashed repeatedly with EMC’s chief executive, Joseph M. Tucci, and he fired her in July 2008. VMware’s shares dropped 24 percent on the day she was ousted.Ms. Greene said she had some “trepidation” about returning to the public arena as a prominent corporate executive. But she found the Google opportunity irresistible. Since she joined the board in 2012, she said, she has been increasingly impressed by Google’s people and its “amazingly sophisticated technologies,” including machine learning, data analytics, voice and image recognition, and search.Ms. Greene described her goal in her new job as harnessing these technical capabilities as cloud services that can be built into corporate applications. “We want to bring together and integrate these technologies in a usable way,” she said, “so companies can move more quickly and make better decisions.”Mr. Rosenblum, who took a two-year leave from Stanford to work at Bebop, will return to the university, though he will spend a day a week at Google.

Stepping up to one of the most influential roles in tech, Diane B. Greene just accepted an appointment to run Google's cloud enterprise business. She is a serial entrepreneur and ocean-loving adventurer most famous for co-founding VMware, a software company that sold to EMC in 2003 for $635 million in cash.
 When VMware went public in 2007, the 76% surge in its stock price eclipsed even Google's historic 18% first day gain in 2004.
Get to know this legendary Silicon Valley entrepreneur, investor and influencer. How much of her story do you already know?
Filling her sails
1.     Diane B. Greene was born in Rochester, New York in 1955.
2.     Her mom was a teacher.
3.     Her dad was an engineer.
4.     She was raised in Annapolis by the water and says the sea inspires her.
5.     Crabbing, sailing and ice skating were her favorite activates as a child.
6.     Her first foray into entrepreneurship was sneaking up on crabs--for which she earned five bucks per crustacean. "You get in a boat, the crabs attach to pilings along the shore, you sneak up behind them and pick them up," Greene describes. "You need to be sure that you don't let them bite you."
7.     At 19, she organized the first Windsurfing World Championship.
8.     She won the national women's dinghy championship in 1976 at 21 years old.
9.     That year, she also earned her bachelor's in mechanical engineering from the University of Vermont.
10.   She then earned a master's degree from MIT in naval architecture.
11.   Her first job? Designing offshore oil rigs.
12.   The job let the wind out of its sails when she was forbidden from visiting oil rigs because of her sex. "My firm told me I couldn't go," says Greene.
13.   She quit. (Imagine you're the company that loses Diane Greene over your women-at-work policy!) Windsurfing led her to Hawaii.
Early adventures
14.   Windsurfing led her to a role in the engineering department of Windsurfing International, then to a position at Coleman, the storied outdoors outfitter.
15.   Her next adventure was as as the computer geek on a treasure hunt to a sunken Spanish galleon off Saipan.
16.   After that project, she took a role at Sybase. "That's when my boring life started," she quips.
17.   When she was 33, she earned a masters degree in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. She met her future husband Martin, a professor at Stanford, there.
18.   They have two children together.
19.   She built out her tech resume with leadership roles at Tandem Computers and Silicon Graphics
Entrepreneurship
20.   When she was 42, she founded her first technology company, streaming-media startup Vxtreme.
21.   It sold to Microsoft in 1997 in a private deal around $75 million. 
22.   In 1998, her husband Martin asked for her support in productizing "a concept" he was working on with some of his grad students. It was a virtualization approach that would allow a computer to run more than one operating system at the same time. She was intrigued.
23.   She worked on VMware without pay for a year.
24.   Her husband returned to his role as a professor at Stanford. She become CEO at VMware.
25.   She raised capital to build out the "virtualization" concept into a product. Diane said at the time, "I never aspired to be a CEO, period."
26.   Diane made time for family even as VMware took off. "I have pretty set rules that I go home for dinner every night unless I am traveling," Greene says. "I have a lot of help to do chores so I can be with my family, and I never have any help over the weekends."
A steady head for headwinds
27.   As VMware's success thrust her into the spotlight, she was sometimes criticized for her lack of polish. Reported in Fortune in 2007, "Greene's presentation skills lagged her technical acumen," said Mike Kwatinetz, a venture capitalist who invested in VMware in 2001, "and because of that she was underrated."
28.   Others found her approach a refreshing break from the big egos of Silicon Valley.  Network World called her "humble" and "unassuming" in a glowing article about her leadership.
29.   "I'm pretty transparent and clear about things," Greene says about herself. "The things I do and the way I act are no different than I would expect of others. Mostly it's about being very clear about what we are trying to do and communicating a lot and showing absolute consistency and integrity about what I say and do."
30.   VMware tried twice to go public, but pulled back both times.
Legendary exit 
31.   In 2003, when Diane was 48, VMware accepted the offer from EMC for $635 million in cash.
32.   At the time of the acquisition, VMware had 300 employees.
33.   Of the 37.1 million stock options granted to VMware employees before it went public, Greene received 2.7%. (The typical award by startup boards to CEOs they recruit is 7% to 10%, Fortune reported.) "Joe Tucci told me he thought he was being 'very generous,' " she says. "Those were his exact words." 
34.   In a time when Google had warmed toilet seats, her style at VMware was dinged as too frugal by some--and businesslike by others. "We're very focused on creating a phenomenal work environment," said Greene. "But we try to do it very frugally because that's sustainable."
35.   When VMWare built an eco-friendly, environmentally sustainable headquarters in Palo Alto, owner EMC balked at the price tag.
36. In 2006, Intuit appointed Diane to their board of directors.
37.   Diane began growing her reputation in the mid-2000s as a tech investors. Some of her investments at the time, according to Crunchbase, included, Clinkle, Cloud Physics, Cumulus Networks, Nimbula, Unity Technologies, RockMelt and Cloudera.
38.  EMC's CEO, Joseph M. Tucci, fired Diane in 2012.
39.  At the time Diane was let go as CEO of VMWare, the company had 3,000 employees (up from 300 when acquired.)
40.  VMWare stock tanked 24% that day.
41.   Because Diane was fired, three top executives left the company in protest.
42.  Diane's story is reminiscent of another visionary,  Sandy Lerner, the serial entrepreneur who co-founded enterprise software networking legend Cisco Systems with her husband in 1984. Sandy was fired by Don Valentine of Sequoia and removed as CEO, in response to which Cisco Systems executives, including her husband, left.
Leadership at Google and new adventures
43.  That same year, 2012, Google appointed Diane to their Board of Directors.
44.  Late in 2012, Diane founded Bebop, a cloud software development startup.
45.  Google acquired Bebop this year, right before her appointment to lead the cloud enterprise business.
46.  Dell is engaged in attempting to buy EMC in what will be, if it happens, the largest single technology deal ever--some $67 billion.  Michael Dell has  remarked, "VMware is a crown jewel of the EMC federation."
47.   Diane was appointed to Alphabet's board of directors last month and now is expected to grow Google's share of cloud enterprise infrastructure in fascinating and unpredictably brilliant ways.

Google Just Added A Board Member From A Big Microsoft Rival

The smartphone is eventually going to die, and Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook are racing to kill it





Google has a new plan to make the entire internet faster




Google has just added a 10th board member: Diane B. Greene, a cofounder and former CEO of VMWare, a leading enterprise computing player.
It's interesting that of all the areas Google is in -- consumer Internet services, mobile phones, consumer electronics -- they picked a board member frm the enterprise computing world. Particularly, from a company that Microsoft views as one of its top competitors.
That could mean that Google is going to take our advice and begin paying more attention to its Google Apps enterprise business. Apps is already notching up some big wins, but a lot of its parts are still missing key features that they'd need to act as a complete replacement for Microsoft Office and other traditional business software.
VMWare, the company where Greene made her name, makes virtualization software, which basically allows multiple "virtual computers" to run on a single piece of hardware, saving hardware costs. It can also allow multiple different operating systems to run, which lessens the pressure to standardize on Microsoft Windows.
Larry Page did not name Google Apps among his top priorities when he took the CEO job last year, it's not one of the seven main product groups, and Google does not usually mention it on its earnings calls. It still accounts for less than $1 billion in annual revenue despite being six years old.
But there's a lot of money suddenly flowing into cloud-based enterprise disruptors again -- companies like Box, Workday, and Cloudra are raising big rounds, Jive had a successful IPO, and SAP bought SuccessFactors for more than $3 billion.
Maybe Google figured it was time to start paying more attention to this trend.
Or maybe they just wanted another technical outsider on the board.
Google's board currently consists of nine people, but three are company execs and one --John Doerr -- is a VC from Google's original big investor. So having more outside blood could make the board stronger, and more able to stand up to questionable decisions by its executive leadership.
Google did not make Greene available for comment.
Here's the full list, not including Greene.

Transcript: An Interview with Diane Greene Founder, VMware
Date: January 31, 2011
Interview with Diane Greene [introduction music]
Lucy Sanders: Hi, this is Lucy Sanders the CEO of the National Center for Women in Information Technology or NCWIT. With me is Leigh Kennedy, one of our fine board members as well as a serial entrepreneur herself. Hi Leigh.
Leigh Kennedy: Hi Lucy, thanks for having me today.
Lucy: Also Larry Nelson from W3W3. Hi Larry.
Larry Nelson. I'm so happy to be here. This is a wonderful series and what we really like about it, it really helps other people.
Lucy: Absolutely, we have great interviews in this series with wonderful entrepreneurs. We are now over 50 interviews in our series and I felt very excited about that.
Leigh: Wow.
Lucy: Today we are interviewing a person who I consider to be one of the top entrepreneurs I know, co-founder and founding CEO of VMWare, Diane Greene. VMWare is one of those companies I know many of our listeners have heard about because it introduced something really, really innovative, which was a virtualization layer between hardware and software that allows different operating systems to run on the same machine. That was pretty cool and that was one of VMWare's really innovative leads into the market, truly revolutionary. When the company went public in 2007, it was Silicon Valley's biggest IPO since Google, no small accomplishment. So we can't wait to talk to Diane. She left VMWare in 2008, but she continues to invest in companies and to advise entrepreneurs and she serves on very impressive boards, such as Intuit, MIT Corporation and more. Diane, welcome.
Diane Greene: Well, thanks very much. It's always good to participate in the entrepreneurial community in any way I can.
Lucy: So let's get right to the questions, Diane. We're really interested in understanding how you first got into technology. As you look at the technologies out there today, which ones do you think are especially cool?
Diane: Well I've always had an orientation around science and engineering. In high school I built a model bridge with movable trusses and instrumented one of them with a strange gauge. That really launched me into what I found out was called engineering. I was also really active racing sailboats, which meant maintaining them and tuning them which was a lot of technology to keep the boat going fast in addition to racing it. So I would say I started doing things in technology in high school. Nothing like what the kids are doing today with their computers, but certainly technology. In terms of what is out there today that's really exciting, like everybody else, it's mobile connectivity, the social networking, the sensors, particularly around imaging. All these things contributing to our ability to have a digitally enhanced world is tremendously exciting.
Larry: Boy, I'll say. I have a feeling that if I was going to try to recruit a relationship with you that if my company started with the letter V, like in Vermont, I would get a little bit further.
Lucy: [laughs]
Leigh: I didn't understand it, either.
Lucy: I didn't understand it, either, that's OK.
Diane: It's possible, because I'm puzzled about what you're talking about.
Larry: I was just looking at VMWare, VXtreme.
Diane: Oh, V, I thought you said Z. That's right, VMWare, VXtreme, completely coincidental. VMware, we were looking for a name and at the time, during the dot com bubble, every URL was taken. So we said "Let's do a placeholder." I thought "Let's just do something really descriptive as a placeholder, virtual machine software, call it VMware." So the name stuck.
Lucy: Well, that's an interesting story.
Larry: Yeah.
Leigh: Yeah it is.
Lucy: Diane, I'm going to jump into the next question.
Diane: Our PR person didn't want to talk to us because they thought "What a boring name." [Leigh and Larry laugh]
Leigh: I think it's a good name.
Larry: Yeah, I like it.
Lucy: So Diane, I'll jump in to the next question. We're always curious how people that are really into technology and science and they make the leap to be an entrepreneur, which is not always second nature to a lot of technologists. So tell us about how that happened and what it is about entrepreneurship that you love.
Diane: Well I've always also been an organizer. I always have started new things. Very early on when I was actually still in high school back in 1971 I got into windsurfing. I was the only windsurfer on the East coast. I started an ice hockey team in college. So I've always, in addition to having an affinity for technology I also like to organize. I like to do things with other people. I think I'm not particularly good at working for other people if our visions aren't aligned. That kind of pushes me towards leading people and being in charge. I think it's a desire to do new things, organize new things and make new things happen. The technology background is just helpful and is why my entrepreneurship is around technology, I guess.
Larry: You've done so many different things. I know you're going to have a great career ahead of you, it's just the beginning. In your career path, who was either a mentor or someone who was a role model that really influenced your future?
Diane: Well I have to say my family had an enormous influence on me for better or for worse. Then I had an absolutely amazing band teacher in high school that set up a system for measuring how we were doing which made it extremely clear how to get ahead and how to become first chair and then had us all working together amazingly well as a band and as an orchestra to where our little motley crew would go on and win state championships. I had her as my band and orchestra teacher for three years, and I think she had an enormous influence on me. She could have managed a huge [laughs] corporation. She had all those fundamental principles and skills down. Then as I've gone through my career in Silicon Valley in the tech industry, I would have to say I had a mentor at Tandem Computers named Franco Putzolo, who really taught me how to take a measured approach to whatever it was I was doing and helped develop my ability to try and really take the time to always do things well.
Lucy: Well, you know when we started the interview we said we get a lot of interesting answers to these questions, and that's the first time we've heard a band teacher.
Diane: [laughter] I've only said this one other time, when I was being interviewed at VMware, and the absolutely amazing thing is I got emails from someone else that had been in her band and orchestra and said, "Yes, she was my mentor, too."
Lucy: Well, I think that's fascinating and perfectly understandable when you think about a lot of great technologists are great musicians...
Leigh: Exactly, yup.
Lucy: ...and I can see where a band and orchestra, lots of life skills there. So fascinating answer. Diane, what is the toughest thing you've ever had to do in your career?
Diane: Working for other people that I wasn't able to convince them of my vision.
Lucy: That's hard.
Diane: That really was [laughs] the most difficult thing.
Leigh: Yeah, that's always tough, and I think one of the reasons a lot of entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs is they don't like working for other people, so... [laughs] [laughter]
Leigh: ...that makes perfect sense. [laughs]
Diane: We can have the same vision, but that's not the norm. I mean normally it's the leader that sets the vision and doesn't necessarily take the vision of...it's also formative because when you are the leader you're very sensitive to the fact that you need to [laughs] incorporate everybody else's vision or they're going to feel frustrated. Also, it's good for the company because you don't always have the right vision yourself. At least I don't. But yeah. I do think it drives a lot of entrepreneurship, is this need to work on a vision that you're really passionate about. So you're left with no [laughs] choice but to do it yourself.
Leigh: Well, that brings us to our next question. We have a lot of young people and people wanting to become entrepreneurs that listen to our interviews. So if you were sitting here with a young person looking to become an entrepreneur, what advice would you give to them? Diane: If they have a vision of something, there are infinite ways to improve the world. If you really see something that really excites you, then set about doing it and do it right. Don't cut any corners. Go about it with absolute quality in every way you approach it and think it through and execute on it.
Larry: Well, I'm tying right in with that. What are your personal characteristics, do you think, that have given you the advantage of being an entrepreneur?
Diane: I don't start something unless I can really see for myself how it can be done, how it's possible. Then once I see that, I don't think of failure as an option. There's always a way to make it successful, and I'm pretty relentless about that. I think also I really love and get energized from working with other people [laughs] when they're smarter than me, and that's not always hard. So I think those two things, that relentless "There is a way," and then just enjoying finding that way with other people really has helped me have a lot of successes as an entrepreneur.
Lucy: Relentless is a word we hear a lot.
Leigh: And failure not being an option. Lucy: And failure not being an option. I think that those are great personal characteristics to have. Diane, we ask one other question around how entrepreneurs...it's not so much bringing balance into your personal and professional lives, but how do you integrate them?
Diane: Well, I see it as my life. I do what I care about and what I want to do, and so part of that is my family and raising my family, and part of that is going on outdoor adventures, which I don't do nearly as much as I would like to. Building things I think has been a large part of...it's of course been building companies in the tech industry. But there are fundamental principles about how I go about things that are utterly consistent across everything I do, so that integrates them pretty naturally.
Leigh: Diane, you've done some just really, really interesting things that were like leading edge in many areas--sports, technology. Tell us about what you're passionate about now or what's next for you?
Diane: I'm really not sure what's next. I'm working on it, and I definitely want a big project in my life. Leigh: Well, that's a great answer, too. [laughs] We don't always know, and it's good to know that you're in that spot.
Lucy: Well, when you're in that spot, you can pay attention and actually look for the next big project.
Larry: There you go.
Lucy: Yeah, absolutely. Well, Diane, thanks very much for talking to us. We really appreciate it. I wanted to remind listeners where they can hear this interview, at W3W3.com and also NCWIT.org.
Diane: Yeah, and let me just send a word of encouragement to people. I think when you want to do something, you can always do it and make a success of it. Good luck.
Larry: Well, thank you for that.
Lucy: Thank you, Diane.
Leigh: Thanks, Diane.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
