Athenian Prostitution
The Business of Sex
Edward E. Cohen


A pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical Athens
Presents a unique focus on the business aspects of Athenian prostitution
Explores the contradictions and inconsistencies of Athens' attitude toward and treatment of commercial sex








Athenian Prostitution
The Business of Sex
Edward E. Cohen



Description



This is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical Athens from a commercial (rather than from a cultural or moral) perspective. Following the author's earlier book on Athenian banking, this work analyzes erotic business at Athens in the context of the Athenian economy. For the Athenians, the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed. Pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of slave labor--was contemptible. Pursued under conditions appropriate to non-servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of free labor--was not violative of Athenian work ethics. As a mercantile activity, however, prostitution was not untouched by Athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits; as the "business of sex," prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of Greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality. Yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view, in which the sale of sex, lawful and indeed pervasive at Athens, is presented alluringly.In a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender, to economic, legal and social historians, and to classicists, the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis, and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping. The author juxtaposes the widespread practice of "prostitution pursuant to written contract" with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders, and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes (male and female) coexisting with Athenian society's pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage.

Athenian Prostitution
The Business of Sex
Edward E. Cohen


Reviews and Awards

A Choice Outstanding Academic Title'



"Cohen's book is an excellent study with a focus on the practical aspects of prostitution and a careful weighing of the available evidence. Anyone with an interest in ancient sex work, and with enough of a background in ancient Greece, will find this book extremely useful."--Stephanie Lynn Budin, American Historical Review
"This book is an excellent introduction to the topic of Athenian prostitution and will inevitably provide much fodder for discussion. It should be read by all students and scholars interested in Greek sex, law, and the economy."--Deborah Kamen, CJ-Online
"And then there's Athenian Prostitution: The Business of Sex by polymath University of Pennsylvania professor Edward E. Cohen (Oxford University Press, $74), a convincing picture of a trade where women were often the tight-fisted, class-conscious, and successful purveyors of companionship and sexual service."--Joe DiStefano, Philadelphia Inquirer
"Every new book by Edward E. Cohen is an event and Athenian Prostitution is no exception to the rule. The originality of this work is to offer an unprecedented economic approach to the question of prostitution in fourth-century BCE Athens. Among others, it reveals that citizens, and not slaves only, could be prostitutes, despite the social opprobrium attached to this activity. The book thus exposes an aspect of ancient Athenian society that has been completely neglected so far. Well written, with many colorful and striking passages, from beginning to end the book proves to be a fascinating reading."--Alain Bresson, The University of Chicago
"An important and fascinating study of both male and female prostitution in Athens in all its aspects: economic, legal, social, and ideological. Athenian Prostitution should be read by anyone interested in the ancient economy, Athenian social history, ancient law, and the history of sexuality."--Adriaan Lanni, Harvard Law School
"Although the cultural aspects of prostitution in ancient Greece have been well covered by others, Cohen attempts to explore its commercial aspects via bold, fresh scholarshipEL. Taking a sensitive topic into a new scholarly direction marks Cohen's work as an important addition to the field of antiquity. Essential."-Choice
"Although the cultural aspects of prostitution in ancient Greece have been well covered by others, Cohen attempts to explore its commercial aspects via bold, fresh scholarship. Taking a sensitive topic into a new scholarly direction marks Cohen's work as an important addition to the field of antiquity. Essential."--CHOICE
"An authoritative study, highly recommended for its clear writing, depth of analysis and density of interest...Cohen brilliantly demonstrates how prostitution infiltrated all aspects of Greek culture." --Times Literary Supplement

Item Description: COUNTERPOINT, United States, 2009. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Original. Language: English . Brand New Book. From its indefinite beginnings through its broad commercialization and endless reinterpretation, American rock-and-roll music has been preoccupied with an end-of-the-world mentality that extends through the whole of American popular music. In Apocalypse Jukebox, Edward Whitelock and David Janssen trace these connections through American music genres, uncovering a mix of paranoia and hope that characterizes so much of the nation s history. From the book s opening scene, set in the American South during a terrifying 1833 meteor shower, the sense of doom is both palpable and inescapable; a deep foreboding that shadows every subsequent development in American popular music and, as Whitelock and Janssen contend, stands as a key to understanding and explicating America itself. Whitelock and Janssen examine the diversity of apocalyptic influences within North American recorded music, focusing in particular upon a number of influential performers, including Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, John Coltrane, Devo, R.E.M., Sleater-Kinney, and Green Day. In Apocalypse Jukebox, Whitelock and Janssen reveal apocalypse as a permanent and central part of the American character while establishing rock-and-roll as a true reflection of that character.

FROM THE PUBLISHER - Ford Madox Ford has been among the neglected writers of the first quarter of this century. His tragic novel, THE GOOD SOLDIER, in which he portrays, in the stoical but fallible figure of Edward Ashburnham, an example of the English landed gentry at its best, was written just before the First World War. (It is a curious detail that 4 August, the date of the outbreak of war, is made a date of recurring significance in the characters� lives.) This unembittered story of deceit and hatred was readily termed �great�, �a piece of art and therefore an enlightenment�, and �beautiful and moving� by contemporary reviewers. A more modern estimate of its worth is expressed by Walter Allen in Tradition and Dream: �Ford�s finest novel is probably THE GOOD SOLDIER (1915), as formally perfect a novel as any in English and an amazingly subtle account, by one of them, of the lives of four people who appear to live in harmony and friendship .� Previous Owner�s Name Embossed On Title Page, Otherwise Good In Wrappers.

Item Description: COUNTERPOINT, United States, 2009. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Original. Language: English . Brand New Book. From its indefinite beginnings through its broad commercialization and endless reinterpretation, American rock-and-roll music has been preoccupied with an end-of-the-world mentality that extends through the whole of American popular music. In Apocalypse Jukebox, Edward Whitelock and David Janssen trace these connections through American music genres, uncovering a mix of paranoia and hope that characterizes so much of the nation s history. From the book s opening scene, set in the American South during a terrifying 1833 meteor shower, the sense of doom is both palpable and inescapable; a deep foreboding that shadows every subsequent development in American popular music and, as Whitelock and Janssen contend, stands as a key to understanding and explicating America itself. Whitelock and Janssen examine the diversity of apocalyptic influences within North American recorded music, focusing in particular upon a number of influential performers, including Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, John Coltrane, Devo, R.E.M., Sleater-Kinney, and Green Day. In Apocalypse Jukebox, Whitelock and Janssen reveal apocalypse as a permanent and central part of the American character while establishing rock-and-roll as a true reflection of that character.

Item Description: MIT Press Ltd, United States, 1999. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Repr.. Language: English . Brand New Book. foreword by William S. Cohen, U.S. Secretary of Defense Biological weapons pose a horrifying and growing threat to the United States and to the world in general. Revelations about Iraq s weapons research and the plans of the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan serve as frightening reminders of the potential for military or terrorist use of biological agents.The essays in this book, many of which were originally published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, examine the medical, scientific, and political dimensions of limiting the threat posed by biological weapons. The contributors consider the current threat posed by biological weapons, the history of attempts to control them, episodes in which biological agents have been used, Iraq s biological warfare program, and policies that the United States might pursue to reduce the threat.Contributors : Suzanne Barth, Pamela Berkowsky, Kristin A.

 This is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical Athens from a commercial (rather than from a cultural or moral) perspective. Following the author's earlier book on Athenian banking, this work analyzes erotic business at Athens in the context of the Athenian economy. For the Athenians, the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed. Pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of slave labor--was contemptible. Pursued under conditions appropriate to non-servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of free labor--was not violative of Athenian work ethics. As a mercantile activity, however, prostitution was not untouched by Athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits; as the "business of sex," prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of Greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality. Yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view, in which the sale of sex, lawful and indeed pervasive at Athens, is presented alluringly.In a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender, to economic, legal and social historians, and to classicists, the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis, and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping. The author juxtaposes the widespread practice of "prostitution pursuant to written contract" with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders, and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes (male and female) coexisting with Athenian society's pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage.

Review


"Cohen's book is an excellent study with a focus on the practical aspects of prostitution and a careful weighing of the available evidence. Anyone with an interest in ancient sex work, and with enough of a background in ancient Greece, will find this book extremely useful."--Stephanie Lynn Budin, American Historical Review"This book is an excellent introduction to the topic of Athenian prostitution and will inevitably provide much fodder for discussion.  It should be read by all students and scholars interested in Greek sex, law, and the economy."--Deborah Kamen, CJ-Online"And then there's Athenian Prostitution: The Business of Sex by polymath University of Pennsylvania professor Edward E. Cohen (Oxford University Press, $74), a convincing picture of a trade where women were often the tight-fisted, class-conscious, and successful purveyors of companionship and sexual service."--Joe DiStefano, Philadelphia Inquirer"Every new book by Edward E. Cohen is an event and Athenian Prostitution is no exception to the rule. The originality of this work is to offer an unprecedented economic approach to the question of prostitution in fourth-century BCE Athens. Among others, it reveals that citizens, and not slaves only, could be prostitutes, despite the social opprobrium attached to this activity. The book thus exposes an aspect of ancient Athenian society that has been completely neglected so far. Well written, with many colorful and striking passages, from beginning to end the book proves to be a fascinating reading."--Alain Bresson, The University of Chicago"An important and fascinating study of both male and female prostitution in Athens in all its aspects: economic, legal, social, and ideological. Athenian Prostitution should be read by anyone interested in the ancient economy, Athenian social history, ancient law, and the history of sexuality."--Adriaan Lanni, Harvard Law School"Although the cultural aspects of prostitution in ancient Greece have been well covered by others, Cohen attempts to explore its commercial aspects via bold, fresh scholarshipEL. Taking a sensitive topic into a new scholarly direction marks Cohen's work as an important addition to the field of antiquity. Essential."-Choice "Although the cultural aspects of prostitution in ancient Greece have been well covered by others, Cohen attempts to explore its commercial aspects via bold, fresh scholarship. Taking a sensitive topic into a new scholarly direction marks Cohen's work as an important addition to the field of antiquity. Essential."--CHOICE"An authoritative study, highly recommended for its clear writing, depth of analysis and density of interest...Cohen brilliantly demonstrates how prostitution infiltrated all aspects of Greek culture." --Times Literary Supplement

Overview



This is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical Athens from a commercial (rather than from a cultural or moral) perspective. Following the author's earlier book on Athenian banking, this work analyzes erotic business at Athens in the context of the Athenian economy. For the Athenians, the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed. Pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of slave labor--was contemptible. Pursued under conditions appropriate to non-servile endeavor, prostitution--like all forms of free labor--was not violative of Athenian work ethics. As a mercantile activity, however, prostitution was not untouched by Athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits; as the "business of sex," prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of Greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality. Yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view, in which the sale of sex, lawful and indeed pervasive at Athens, is presented alluringly.  In a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender, to economic, legal and social historians, and to classicists, the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis, and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping. The author juxtaposes the widespread practice of "prostitution pursuant to written contract" with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders, and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes (male and female) coexisting with Athenian society's pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage.

                Cohen, Edward E. Dated Coins of Antiquity. Shekels of Tyre - Supplemental Photographs (Release 2). 2017. Hardbound. 551 pp. with nearly 1000 photos illustrating the text. (GR). (GR357)Among the more popular sections of Dated Coins of Antiquity (DCA) (pages 501 to 515) has been the date and its rarity listing for the silver shekels of Tyre and the smaller half, quarter and eighth shekels bearing the local god Melkart. These coins were struck nearly continuously for 191 years, from 126 BC to 66 AD. In addition to the date written with Greek letters, most of these coins also carry a monogram (usually also in Greek letters) and a Phoenician letter - alef or bet. This first photographic supplement encompasses more than 500 different varieties of these coins, defined by their varying dates, monograms, Phoenician letters and the four denominations in silver. With the rarity listing of dates in DCA, this supplement presents the most comprehensive catalog of the reported dates, monograms and varieties for the shekels of Tyre and its minor silver denominations.

CNG is pleased to publish a limited hardcover edition of Dated Coins of Antiquity. Shekels of Tyre - Supplemental Photographs (Release 2). Release 2 nearly doubles the coverage contained in the prior release. This volume does not duplicate the material in the originalDated Coins of Antiquity (DCA), which catalogs over 6000 coins of the ancient world dated before the millennium divide, 1 BC / AD 1. Release 2 encompasses the most extensive date listing and photographic evidence for these dated coins struck nearly annually for 191 years, 126 BC through AD 65.

Release 2 has a chapter for each denomination and date that the author has confirmed in museums, private collections and the market. It includes full-size photos and an enlargement of the date, monogram and Phoenician letter (alef or bet). Nearly 1,000 photos are contained in 551 pages. Tables and graphs report the aggregate counts in museums of shekels and half shekels by year. Additional tables summarize the varieties of the shekels and half shekels and monograms each year that are contained in DCA-Tyre. Illustrations depict all the different forms of the monograms and Phoenician letters.
