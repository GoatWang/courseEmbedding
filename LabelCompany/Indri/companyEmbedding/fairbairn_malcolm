EMILY WANG FAIRBAIRN,

Respondents.
 
 


::::::::::::::::::
ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CEASE-AND-DESIST PROCEEDINGS, MAKING FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING REMEDIAL SANCTIONS AND A CEASE-AND-DESIST ORDER PURSUANT TO SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 AND SECTION 203(e) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AS TO ASCEND CAPITAL, LLC, AND SECTION 203(f) OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940 AS TO MALCOLM P. FAIRBAIRN AND EMILY WANG FAIRBAIRN
I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") deems it appropriate and in the public interest that public administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Advisers Act") against Ascend Capital, LLC ("Ascend") and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act against Malcolm P. Fairbairn and Emily Wang Fairbairn (jointly, "the Fairbairns").  
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Ascend and the Fairbairns (collectively, "Respondents") have each submitted Offers of Settlement (the "Offers"), which the Commission has determined to accept.  Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission's jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these proceedings, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Sections 203(e) and 203(f) of the Advisers Act ("the Order"), as set forth below.  
III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents' Offers, the Commission finds that:
Respondents
1. Ascend, a Delaware limited liability company, headquartered in San Francisco, California, is a registered investment adviser in the State of California.  It serves as investment adviser to three hedge funds (Ascend Partner, L.P., Ascend Offshore Fund, Ltd., and Ascend Partners Sapient, L.P.) and two separately managed accounts.  Ascend has full discretion to make investment decisions for the hedge funds and the two separately managed accounts.  
2. Malcolm P. Fairbairn, age 39, is the founder and sole managing member of Ascend and husband of Emily Wang Fairbairn.  Mr. Fairbairn has sole responsibility for managing the investment portfolios of Ascend's three hedge funds and two separately managed accounts.  Mr. Fairbairn makes and authorizes all trading decisions on behalf of Ascend, and relays his trading decisions to his wife, Ms. Fairbairn, for execution.  
3. Emily Wang Fairbairn, age 40, is employed as a trader at Ascend and is the wife of Malcolm P. Fairbairn.  She was responsible for directing the execution of all the securities trades that are the subject of the Order.
Background
4. On three occasions in 2001, Ascend and the Fairbairns sold securities short during the five business days before the pricing of public offerings and then covered the short positions with securities purchased in the offerings.  Their profits on these transactions totaled $19,033.50.  
5. Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act prohibits effecting a short sale of a security registered on a national securities exchange in contravention of the rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe.  Rule 105 of Regulation M, "Short Selling in Connection With a Public Offering," prohibits covering a short sale with securities obtained in a public offering if the short sale occurred within five business days before the pricing of the offering (the "pricing period").  In pertinent part, Regulation M, Rule 105 provides:  "In connection with an offering of securities for cash pursuant to a registration statement ... filed under the Securities Act, it shall be unlawful for any person to cover a short sale with offered securities purchased from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in the offering, if such short sale occurred during the ... period beginning five business days before the pricing of the offered securities and ending with such pricing ...." 17 C.F.R. § 242.105(a)(1).
6. During the relevant period, Ascend and the Fairbairns engaged in short selling and covering transactions prohibited under Regulation M, Rule 105 ("Rule 105") in connection with their purchase of securities in public offerings made by Praecis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("PRCS"), Sprint Corporation ("FON"), and American Medical Systems Holdings ("AMMD").   
A. Praecis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
7. On January 26, 2001, PRCS filed with the Commission a Form S-1 registration statement for an offering of 5.5 million shares of its common stock.  After the market closed on February 14, 2001, the shares were priced at $24.56 per share.  Accordingly, the Rule 105 pricing period was February 8 through February 14, 2001.
8. On February 13, 2001, Ascend and the Fairbairns sold short 1,000 PRCS shares.  On February 15, 2001, shares sold through the offering became publicly available and Ascend and the Fairbairns purchased 1,000 PRCS shares in the offering from an underwriter.   
9. On March 13, 2001, with a short position of 1,000 shares and a long position of 1,000 shares purchased in the offering, Emily Fairbairn directed a trader at an executing brokerage firm to "cross" 1,000 PRCS shares at $23.50.  Ms. Fairbairn's "cross" instruction resulted in the trader placing limit orders to sell and buy 1,000 PRCS shares at $23.50 within the same Ascend account.  A NASDAQ audit trail shows that the orders to sell and buy 1,000 shares were matched on the exchange.  
10.  Given that Ascend was on both sides of the trade - selling the offering shares with a limit order and then placing another limit order to buy the same number of shares at the same price - the transaction resulted in a cross trade with the offering shares being sold and then purchased again by Ascend.  
11. Later on March 13, 2001, in violation of Rule 105, Ms. Fairbairn covered the open 1,000-share short position with the 1,000 PRCS shares purchased in the public offering. 
B. Sprint Corporation 
12. On February 20, 2001, FON filed with the Commission a Form S-3 registration statement for an offering of over 152 million shares of its common stock.  After the market closed on May 30, 2001, the shares were priced at $19.00 per share and became publicly available.  Accordingly, the Rule 105 pricing period was May 24 through May 30, 2001. 
13.  On May 29, 2001 and May 30, 2001, Ascend and the Fairbairns sold short 35,000 FON shares.  After the pricing, Ascend and the Fairbairns purchased a total of 25,000 FON offering shares from two underwriters.  On May 31, 2001, Ascend and the Fairbairns purchased 10,000 FON shares on the open market and used the shares to partially cover Ascend's open short position, thus reducing Ascend's open short position to 25,000 shares.  
14.  On May 31, 2001, with a short position of 25,000 shares and a long position of 25,000 shares purchased in the offering, Ms. Fairbairn directed a trader at an executing brokerage firm to "cross" 25,000 FON shares at $19.73.  Ms. Fairbairn's "cross" instruction resulted in the trader placing limit orders to sell and buy 25,000 FON shares at $19.73 within the same Ascend account.  A New York Stock Exchange audit trail shows that the orders to buy and sell the 25,000 shares were matched on the exchange.
15. Given that Ascend was on both sides of the trade - selling the offering shares with a limit order and then placing another limit order to buy the same number of shares at the same price - the transaction resulted in a cross trade with the offering shares being sold and then purchased again by Ascend.  
16. Later on May 31, 2001, in violation of Rule 105, Ms. Fairbairn covered the open 25,000-share short position with the 25,000 FON shares purchased in the public offering.  
C. American Medical Systems Holdings 
17. On June 6, 2001, AMMD filed with the Commission a Form S-1 registration statement for an offering of over 7 million shares of its common stock.  After the market closed on June 26, 2001, the shares were priced at $16.40 per share; thus, the Rule 105 pricing period was June 20 through June 26, 2001.  
18. On June 25, 2001 and June 26, 2001, Ascend and the Fairbairns sold short 21,000 shares of AMMD.  On June 27, 2001, shares sold through the offering became publicly available and Ascend and the Fairbairns purchased 5,000 shares in AMMD's public offering from an underwriter, and an additional 16,500 shares in the open market.  The total long position of 21,500 shares was later reduced to 21,000 shares with the sale of 500 shares on September 10, 2001.
19.  On October 5, 2001, with a short position of 21,000 AMMD shares and a long position of 21,000 AMMD shares (including the 5,000 shares purchased by Ascend in the public offering), Ms. Fairbairn directed a trader at an executing brokerage firm to "cross" 21,000 shares of AMMD at $18.75.  Ms. Fairbairn's "cross" instruction resulted in the trader placing limit orders to sell and buy 21,000 AMMD shares at $18.75 within the same Ascend account.  A NASDAQ audit trail shows the orders to buy and sell 21,000 AMMD shares were matched on the exchange.  
20.  Given that Ascend was on both sides of the trade - selling the 5,000 offering shares with a limit order and then placing another limit order to buy the same number of shares at the same price - the transaction resulted in a cross trade with the 5,000 offering shares being sold and then purchased again by Ascend.  
21. Later on October 5, 2001, in violation of Rule 105, Ms. Fairbairn partially covered the open 21,000-share short position with the 5,000 AMMD shares purchased in the public offering.  
22. As a result of the conduct described above, Ascend and the Fairbairns willfully1 violated Regulation M, Rule 105 thereunder, which makes it "unlawful for any person to cover a short sale with offered securities purchased from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in the offering, if such short sale occurred during the ... period beginning five business days before the pricing of the offered securities and ending with the pricing."
23. As a result of the conduct described above regarding the trading in FON, Ascend and the Fairbairns willfully violated Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits effecting "a short sale ... of any security registered on a national securities exchange, in contravention of the rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors."
IV.
In determining to accept the Offers, the Commission considered remedial acts promptly undertaken by Respondents and cooperation afforded the Commission staff.
V.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate and in the public interest to impose the sanctions specified in Respondents' Offers.
ACCORDINGLY, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Section 203(e)(5) of the Advisers Act, that Respondent Ascend cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act and Regulation M, Rule 105;  
B. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act and Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act, that Respondents Malcolm P. Fairbairn and Emily Wang Fairbairn cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 10(a) of the Exchange Act and Regulation M, Rule 105.
C. IT IS FURTHERED ORDERED that Respondents shall, jointly and severally, within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest in the total amount of $21,258.50 to the United States Treasury.  Such payment shall be: (A) made by United States postal money order, certified check, bank cashier's check or bank money order; (B) made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission; (C) hand-delivered or mailed to the Office of Financial Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, Operations Center, 6432 General Green Way, Stop 0-3, Alexandria, VA 22312; and (D) submitted under cover letter that identifies Ascend Capital, LLC, Malcolm P.

D. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents shall, jointly and severally, within thirty (30) days of the entry of this Order, pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $25,000.00 to the United States Treasury. Such payment shall be: (A) made by United States postal money order, certified check, bank cashier's check or bank money order; (B) made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission; (C) hand-delivered or mailed to the Office of Financial Management, Securities and Exchange Commission, Operations Center, 6432 General Green Way, Stop 0-3, Alexandria, VA 22312; and (D) submitted under cover letter that identifies Ascend Capital, LLC, Malcolm P.

Here is my Telescope Blog
Research
My research lies at the boundary between cosmology, particle physics and astrophysics.  In particular I am interested in dark matter, dark energy, cosmological inflation and particle astrophysics.  I have been awarded an ERC consolidator grant running from 2015-2020 to study dark matter and particle physics in the early Universe.
Current PhD Students:-
Tarso Franarin - Dark Matter Direct Detection and the Neutrino Bound
John Heal - Dark matter complementarity (LHC vs. direct detection vs. indirect detection
Katja Moskvitch - Dark Matter, Cosmology and Astrophysics
David Rodriguez - Inflation and the electroweak vacuum
Patrick Tunney - Dark Matter phenomenology with the LHC

All relevant information regarding eligibility, including academic and English language requirements, is available from the online prospectus.
 
For further details contact Prof Malcolm Fairbairn and or the Postgraduate Tutor Dr Cedric Weber.
 
PhD Projects
The world of cosmology and particle physics can move quite quickly and it is difficult to say precisely what a student will be working on at any given moment two years in the future.  There are, however, common features of all PhD theses undertaken with me:- 

You will certainly work on more than one topic, I will try and ensure you have expertise in more than one area of the subject by the time you come to write up your thesis.
You will develop and employ a range of both analytic and numerical skills to attack particular problems. 
Students are always encouraged to come up with their own research ideas within the thesis, either by taking an idea I give them and then expanding upon it or by coming up with something completely original on their own.  I will help them winnow down ideas and bring good ones to fruition.

Having explained this approach I will list some areas within which my students and I are active, there is plenty of new work to be done in each :-
The Dark Matter - LHC connection
It is thought that there is 5-8 times as much invisible dark matter in the Universe as there is normal matter. There are three ways of detecting this dark matter, the first is by producing it at a collider, the second is by detecting it as it interacts with baryonic targets in experiments and the third is when we look for the particles produced when two dark matter particles collide and annihilate with each other. In order to understand the nature of dark matter work needs to be done to make a link between these three different approaches, work which involves astrophysics, cosmology and some particle physics.
Inflation
A period of exponential expansion in the early Universe solves many problems in cosmology including why the cosmos is so large and uniform.  Many people think this could be due to an inflaton field which dominates the energy density in the early Universe. Quantum fluctuations in this field end up forming the seeds of structure we see today such as galaxies.  
The main aim is to make a link between what can be observed and physics in the Early Universe, especially now we are learning more about the Higgs field and potentially physics beyond the standard model from observations at the LHC. 
Work in this area would involve cosmology, general relativity and hopefully particle physics, since the ultimate aim of the inflationary program is to understand the particle physics of the inflaton field and how it relates to the other fields we know exist, such as the particles around us today.
I am always looking for motivated, capable students.

The problem with false vacuum Higgs inflation

We investigate the possibility of using the only known fundamental scalar, the Higgs, as an inflaton with minimal coupling to gravity. The peculiar appearance of a plateau or a false vacuum in the renormalised effective scalar potential suggests that the Higgs might drive inflation. For the case of a false vacuum we use an additional singlet scalar field, motivated by the strong CP problem, and its coupling to the Higgs to lift the barrier allowing for a graceful exit from inflation by mimicking hybrid inflation. We find that this scenario is incompatible with current measurements of the Higgs mass andmore » the QCD coupling constant and conclude that the Higgs can only be the inflaton in more complicated scenarios.« less

Rescuing quadratic inflation

February 2014 - Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics


Inflationary models based on a single scalar field φ with a quadratic potential V = ½m{sup 2}φ{sup 2} are disfavoured by the recent Planck constraints on the scalar index, n{sub s}, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio for cosmological density perturbations, r{sub T}. In this paper we study how such a quadratic inflationary model can be rescued by postulating additional fields with quadratic potentials, such as might occur in sneutrino models, which might serve as either curvatons or supplementary inflatons. Introducing a second scalar field reduces but does not remove the pressure on quadratic inflation, but we find a sample of three-fieldmore » models that are highly compatible with the Planck data on n{sub s} and r{sub T}. We exhibit a specific three-sneutrino example that is also compatible with the data on neutrino mass difference and mixing angles.« less

Effects of voids on the reconstruction of the equation of state of dark energy



Lavallaz, Arnaud de
						; Fairbairn, Malcolm
October 2011 - Physical Review. D, Particles Fields


We quantify the effects of the voids known to exist in the Universe upon the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state w. We show that the effect can start to be comparable with some of the other errors taken into account when analyzing supernova data, depending strongly upon the low redshift cutoff used in the sample. For the supernova data alone, the error induced in the reconstruction of w is much larger than the percent level. When the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations and the Cosmic Microwave Background data are included in the fit, the effect of the voids uponmore » the determination of w is much lessened but is not much smaller than some of the other errors taken into consideration when performing such fits. We also look at the effect of voids upon the estimation of the equation of state when we allow w to vary over time and show that even when supernova, Cosmic Microwave Background, and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations data are used to constrain the equation of state, the best fit points in parameter space can change at the 10% level due to the presence of voids, and error-bars increase significantly.« less

Neutron stars as dark matter probes



Lavallaz, Arnaud de
						; Fairbairn, Malcolm
June 2010 - Physical Review. D, Particles Fields


We examine whether the accretion of dark matter onto neutron stars could ever have any visible external effects. Captured dark matter which subsequently annihilates will heat the neutron stars, although it seems the effect will be too small to heat close neutron stars at an observable rate while those at the galactic center are obscured by dust. Nonannihilating dark matter would accumulate at the center of the neutron star. In a very dense region of dark matter such as that which may be found at the center of the galaxy, a neutron star might accrete enough to cause it tomore » collapse within a period of time less than the age of the Universe. We calculate what value of the stable dark matter-nucleon cross section would cause this to occur for a large range of masses.« less

Inflation in models with conformally coupled scalar fields: An application to the noncommutative spectral action



Buck, Michel
						; Fairbairn, Malcolm
						; Sakellariadou, Mairi
August 2010 - Physical Review. D, Particles Fields


Slow-roll inflation is studied in theories where the inflaton field is conformally coupled to the Ricci scalar. In particular, the case of Higgs field inflation in the context of the noncommutative spectral action is analyzed. It is shown that while the Higgs potential can lead to the slow-roll conditions being satisfied once the running of the self-coupling at two-loops is included, the constraints imposed from the CMB data make the predictions of such a scenario incompatible with the measured value of the top quark mass. We also analyze the role of an additional conformally coupled massless scalar field, which arisesmore » naturally in the context of noncommutative geometry, for inflationary scenarios.« less

Spin-independent elastic WIMP scattering and the DAMA annual modulation signal



Fairbairn, Malcolm
						; Schwetz, Thomas, E-mail: malc@cern.ch, E-mail: schwetz@cern.ch
January 2009 - Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics


We discuss the interpretation of the annual modulation signal seen in the DAMA experiment in terms of spin-independent elastic WIMP scattering. Taking into account channeling in the crystal as well as the spectral signature of the modulation signal we find that the low-mass WIMP region consistent with DAMA data is confined to WIMP masses close to m{sub {chi}} {approx_equal} 12 GeV, in disagreement with the constraints from CDMS and XENON. We conclude that even if channeling is taken into account this interpretation of the DAMA modulation signal is disfavoured. There are no overlap regions in the parameter space at 90%more » CL and a consistency test gives the probability of 1.2 Multiplication-Sign 10{sup -5}. We study the robustness of this result with respect to variations of the WIMP velocity distribution in our galaxy, by changing various parameters of the distribution function, and by using the results of a realistic N-body dark matter simulation. We find that only by making rather extreme assumptions regarding halo properties can we obtain agreement between DAMA and CDMS/XENON.« less

Cosmic acceleration in models with density dependent moduli



Fairbairn, Malcolm
October 2004 - Physical Review. D, Particles Fields


The effective equation of state of normal matter is changed in theories where the size of the compact space depends upon the local energy density. In particular we show how the dilution of a fluid due to the expansion of the universe can be compensated by an increase of the effective coupling of that fluid to gravity in the presence of a potential which acts to reduce the size of the compact space. We estimate how much cosmic acceleration can be obtained in such a model and comment on the difficulties faced in finding an appropriate potential.

Capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves



McCullough, Matthew
						; Fairbairn, Malcolm
						; Physics, King's College London, Strand WC2R 2LS
April 2010 - Physical Review. D, Particles Fields


We consider the capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves by inelastic spin-independent scattering on nuclei. We show that if the dark matter annihilates to standard-model particles then, under the assumption of primordial globular cluster formation, the observation of cold white dwarves in the globular cluster M4 appears inconsistent with explanations of the observed DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal based on spin-independent inelastic dark matter scattering. Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core ofmore » M4 than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo. Finally we argue that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to other direct and indirect detection searches.« less

Simplified models for dark matter searches at the LHC



Abdallah, Jalal
						; Araujo, Henrique
						; Arbey, Alexandre
						; ... September 2015 - Physics of the Dark Universe


This document a outlines a set of simplified models for dark matter and its interactions with Standard Model particles. It is intended to summarize the main characteristics that these simplified models have when applied to dark matter searches at the LHC, and to provide a number of useful expressions for reference. The list of models includes both s-channel and t-channel scenarios. For s-channel, spin-0 and spin-1 mediations are discussed, and also realizations where the Higgs particle provides a portal between the dark and visible sectors. The guiding principles underpinning the proposed simplified models are spelled out, and some suggestions formore » implementation are presented.« less
