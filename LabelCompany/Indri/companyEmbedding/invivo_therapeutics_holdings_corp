InVivo Therapeutics Appoints Richard Toselli, M.D. as Chief Medical Officer
July 10, 2017







CEO's Perspective

“As evidenced by the passing of the 21st Century Cures Act, regulators and policy makers have recently highlighted the benefits and utility of Real-World Evidence (RWE) as it pertains to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory decision-making for medical devices. RWE is derived from Real World Data (RWD) collected outside of a traditional clinical trial and includes sources such as patient registries. InVivo is committed to providing regulatory agencies with a comprehensive benchmark comparator dataset using RWE to help support the assessment of the safety and probable benefit of its Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™.  ”  For full text, click here.
Mark Perrin, CEO and Chairman,  5/30/2017

InVivo Therapeutics (NVIV) Announces Seventh Patient Conversion In The INSPIRE Study Of The Neuro-Spinal Scaffold
Published: March 28, 2017 
(BioSpace.com)  CAMBRIDGE, Mass.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–InVivo Therapeutics Holdings Corp. (NVIV) today announced that the patient enrolled in January in the INSPIRE study of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold has improved from a complete AIS A spinal cord injury (SCI) to an incomplete AIS B SCI in the time between the one-month and the two-month evaluations. This is the seventh out of the 11 patients (63.6% conversion rate) with at least one month of follow-up to have had an AIS grade improvement. Two additional patients are early in follow-up and have not yet had their one-month visit. The AIS conversion rate observed in the INSPIRE study to date is considerably higher than published rates observed in a range of SCI natural history databases that are all below 25%.

Using a Mini-Scaffold to Help Treat Spinal Cord Injury
Published: February 28, 2017 
(Bioscience Technology) Patients suffering from complete spinal cord injuries have little to no treatment options that provide meaningful improvement in patient outcomes.
Cambridge, Mass.-based InVivo Therapeutics is trying to change that.  Co-founded in 2005 by MIT professor Robert Langer, and surgeon-scientists Joseph Vacanti, M.D., the company has developed a small, bioresorbable and biocompatible device called the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold, to help patients with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries regain some function.

Experimental scaffold hasn’t reversed her paralysis, but she’s embraced life ‘with wheels as legs’
Published: November 21, 2016 
(STAT News) Jesi Stracham used to captivate biotech investors and inadvertently move markets with social media posts documenting her dogged quest to get out of her wheelchair and back onto her feet.
These days, the energetic 24-year-old North Carolina resident goes online to tell a different story. Many of her Facebook and Instagram posts show her competing in off-road vehicle races, an adaptive water skiing competition, and a pageant for women with disabilities.

We’re One Step Closer to Reversing Paralysis
Published: November 17, 2016 
(Tonic) A new implant joins a small set of treatments offering hope to people with spinal injuries.
Jordan Fallis had been hurt before: a broken arm, broken ribs, a fractured wrist, a fractured hip—but that didn’t deter him from riding. BMX was his passion, and although he always wore protective gear, injuries and brushes with death were things he accepted as part of the deal. One morning in October 2014, the then 24-year-old went to his usual spot in Peoria, Arizona, to practice the routine flips and jumps he’d done hundreds of times before. Well into the afternoon, he entered a backflip but under-rotated, hit the front wheel first, and then fell to the ground. He felt his body tingle like an electric current was passing through it. He remembers hoping he had pinched a nerve.

Transforming SCI treatment — The promise of InVivo’s Neuro-Spinal Scaffold 
Published: October 21, 2016 
(Becker’s Spine Review)  About a decade ago, a novel technology called the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold for patients with spinal cord injury came to fruition. Today, Cambridge, Mass.-based InVivo Therapeutics’ INSPIRE study is underway to prove the technology’s efficacy.
A bioresorbable polymer scaffold, the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold is designed for implantation at the injury site within a spinal cord contusion, degrading over several weeks. The scaffold is composed of two biocompatible and bioresorbable polymers — Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and Poly-L-Lysine. These polymers are manufactured to create a porous scaffold encouraging cellular attachment and neurite outgrowth.

Armed with cutting-edge technology and MIT science, experienced business and medical professionals at InVivo Therapeutics are pushing the boundaries of spinal cord injury research.
We are dedicated and committed. Every employee is passionate about the success of our bold approach. But more importantly, we have genuine compassion for those suffering with spinal cord injury. As the recognized leader in the SCI field, we have a singular focus: improving quality-of-life — and redefining life — for the SCI patients we serve.
InVivo Therapeutics is a company described by many adjectives. In the end, though, InVivo is all about HOPE.
History

InVivo Therapeutics Corporation is a pioneering biomaterials and biotechnology company cofounded in 2005 by MIT professor Bob Langer, ScD, and surgeon-scientist Joseph Vacanti, MD, with a focus on treatment of spinal cord injuries.
Our goal is to develop and commercialize groundbreaking technologies and treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI).
Currently, there are no treatment options to provide meaningful improvement in patient outcomes following SCI. At the core of InVivo’s technology portfolio is the Neuro-Spinal ScaffoldTM, a novel and proprietary biomaterial that is implanted into the epicenter of the injury to modulate the healing environment and serve as a support for neuroregeneration.
InVivo intends to develop its novel Neuro-Spinal Scaffold to treat acute SCI, and its Bioengineered Neural TrailsTM (injectable combinations of biomaterials and neural stem cells) to treat chronic SCI.

Mission

Our mission is to redefine the life of the SCI patient. To date, there are no effective therapies, treatments, or interventions for SCI. We intend to change that.
Although our mission is simple — “to redefine the life of the SCI patient” — the path to accomplishing that mission is complex. SCI is a devastating trauma and requires a multimodal, multidisciplinary treatment approach.
Initial therapeutic successes will likely be incremental. While we believe our Neuro-Spinal Scaffold will be the foundation of effective therapy for acute and chronic SCI, we are constantly evaluating surgical techniques, technologies, devices, and therapeutics that might be complementary to our technology and bring us closer to our goal.

What Sets Us Apart

InVivo’s approach to treating spinal cord injuries revolves around our investigational
Neuro-Spinal Scaffold. This bioresorbable and biocompatible synthetic substrate is composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and poly-L-lysine (PLL), two polymers that have been widely used for years. The Neuro-Spinal Scaffold is intended to be inserted into the spinal cord at the site of injury and will break down over several weeks. We believe the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold will modulate the healing environment in acute SCI and provide the structural support in acute and chronic injury necessary to promote a local environment supportive of cell survival and growth.
The unique properties of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold make it the only SCI therapy focused solely on treating SCI directly at the epicenter of the injury. The effective deployment of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold will require techniques used in other fields of neurosurgery. InVivo is working with leading neurosurgeons to define and establish these techniques.

About The INSPIRE Study


      The INSPIRE Study: InVivo Study of Probable Benefit of the Neuro-Spinal 
      Scaffold™ for Safety and Neurologic Recovery in Subjects with 
      Complete Thoracic AIS A Spinal Cord Injury, is designed to demonstrate 
      the safety and probable benefit of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ 
      for the treatment of complete T2-T12/L1 spinal cord injury in support of 
      a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for approval. For more 
      information, refer to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02138110.
    

About the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ Implant


      Following acute spinal cord injury, surgical implantation of the 
      biodegradable Neuro-Spinal Scaffold within the decompressed and 
      debrided injury epicenter is intended to support appositional healing, 
      thereby reducing post-traumatic cavity formation, sparing white matter, 
      and allowing neural repair within and around the healed wound epicenter. 
      The Neuro-Spinal Scaffold, an investigational device, has 
      received a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) designation and currently is 
      being evaluated in The INSPIRE Study for the treatment of patients with 
      acute, complete (AIS A), thoracic traumatic spinal cord injury and a 
      pilot study for acute, complete (AIS A), cervical (C5-T1) traumatic 
      spinal cord injury. For more information on the cervical study, refer to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT03105882.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

InVivo Therapeutics Receives Clinical Trial Application Approval From UK's Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency






Business Wire




Mar 15, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 


















































  InVivo Therapeutics Holdings Corp. (NVIV) today announced that the Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved the company's Clinical Trial Authorization Application to commence clinical studies in the United Kingdom (UK). The approval will allow the company to enroll patients from the UK into the ongoing INSPIRE study once InVivo receives a favorable opinion from a Research Ethics Committee (REC), Health Regulatory Approval (HRA), and a site is open for enrollment. InVivo currently is in late-stage conversation with various clinical sites, and its first UK site opening should occur in the coming weeks.  "We are very pleased to be expanding the INSPIRE study beyond the U.S. and Canada to Europe," Mark Perrin, InVivo's CEO and Chairman, said. "The benefits of working within the MHRA regulatory construct are readily apparent: only one REC needs to review the study for the whole of UK, compared with individual IRB approvals in the US; site specific assessments are fairly quick; and patients are treated at designated centers of excellence. We look forward to announcing our first UK site."  About The INSPIRE Study  The INSPIRE Study: InVivo Study of Probable Benefit of the Neuro- Spinal Scaffold™ for Safety and Neurologic Recovery in Subjects with Complete Thoracic AIS A Spinal Cord Injury, is designed to demonstrate the safety and probable benefit of the  Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ for the treatment of complete T2-T12/L1 spinal cord injury in support of a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for approval. For more information, refer to https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/study/NCT02138110.  About the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ Implant  Following acute spinal cord injury, surgical implantation of the biodegradable Neuro-Spinal Scaffold within the decompressed and debrided injury epicenter is intended to support appositional healing, thereby reducing post-traumatic cavity formation, sparing white matter, and allowing neural regeneration across the healed wound epicenter. The Neuro-Spinal Scaffold, an investigational device, has received a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) designation and currently is being evaluated in the INSPIRE pivotal probable benefit study for the treatment of patients with complete (AIS A) traumatic acute spinal cord injury.  About InVivo Therapeutics  InVivo Therapeutics Holdings Corp. is a research and clinical-stage biomaterials and biotechnology company with a focus on treatment of spinal cord injuries. The company was founded in 2005 with proprietary technology co-invented by Robert Langer, Sc.D., Professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Joseph P. Vacanti, M.D., who then was at Boston Children's Hospital and who now is affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital. In 2011, the company earned the David S. Apple Award from the American Spinal Injury Association for its outstanding contribution to spinal cord injury medicine. In 2015, the company's investigational Neuro-Spinal Scaffold received the 2015 Becker's Healthcare Spine Device Award. The publicly-traded company is headquartered in Cambridge, MA.

Any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations, and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual future results to differ materially from current expectations include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties relating to the company's ability to successfully open additional clinical sites for enrollment and to enroll additional patients; the timing of the Institutional Review Board, REC and HRA processes; the impact of achieving the OPC on the FDA approval process; the company's ability to commercialize its products; the company's ability to develop, market and sell products based on its technology; the expected benefits and efficacy of the company's products and technology in connection with the treatment of spinal cord injuries; the availability of substantial additional funding for the company to continue its operations and to conduct research and development, clinical studies and future product commercialization; and other risks associated with the company's business, research, product development, regulatory approval, marketing and distribution plans and strategies identified and described in more detail in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and its other filings with the SEC, including the company's Form 10-Qs and current reports on Form 8-K.

(NVIV) today announced that Health Canada has approved the company’s Investigational Testing Authorization application to commence a clinical study of the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ in patients with acute, complete (AIS A) cervical (C5-T1) spinal cord injuries (SCIs). InVivo currently is in late stage conversation with several site Research Ethics Boards and expects to announce its first Canadian site in the coming weeks.“This approval is an important step towards our goal of redefining the life of the spinal cord injury patient,” said Mark Perrin, InVivo’s CEO and Chairman. “We are dedicated to helping as many SCI patients as we can, and this approval helps us to evaluate our investigational product in the most severe spinal cord injury cases, with neurologically complete cervical injuries involving impairment of the arms, hands, trunk, and legs. As I explain further in my CEO’s Perspective, moving into the cervical spinal cord is exciting, since each level of the cervical spinal cord has a substantial functional impact. If the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold were able to preserve, remyelinate and/or regenerate just a small area of spinal cord, we believe this could have significant functional consequences. We look forward to bringing sites onboard in Canada to commence enrollment and ultimately to expanding our study of cervical patients to the United Kingdom and the United States.”A new CEO’s Perspective discussing the differences between thoracic and cervical spinal cord injuries can be found on the InVivo Therapeutics website: http://www.invivotherapeutics.com/about-invivo/ceo-perspective/About the Neuro-Spinal Scaffold™ ImplantFollowing acute spinal cord injury, surgical implantation of the biodegradable Neuro-Spinal Scaffold within the decompressed and debrided injury epicenter is intended to support appositional healing, thereby reducing post-traumatic cavity formation, sparing white matter, and allowing neural regeneration across the healed wound epicenter.

	Item 8.01.  Other Events.





	 




	On April 13, 2017, the Company announced that it intends to amend its protocol for The INSPIRE Study to include an additional arm (the Benchmark Arm) in order to gather baseline and outcome measures on thoracic, complete spinal cord injury patients.  The Company plans to include those patients who have presented at INSPIRE sites since January 1, 2016 but who were excluded from The INSPIRE Study because they did not meet all inclusion criteria or who presented before the sites opened or were enrolling patients.  The Company estimates that 20 to 40 additional patients will participate in the Benchmark Arm, and does not expect the Benchmark Arm to impact the timeline for The INSPIRE Study. The Company plans to submit the amended protocol to the United States Food and Drug Administration in the second quarter of 2017.
