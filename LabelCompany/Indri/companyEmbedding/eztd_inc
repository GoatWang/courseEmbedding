  (a) Win Global Markets Inc (Israel) Ltd., an Israeli company, (b) WGM Services 
  Ltd., a company registered in Cyprus (“WGM”), (c) EZ Invest Securities. 
  Ltd., a Japanese corporation, and (d) SCGP Investments Limited, a Belizean company. 
  We have developed and currently operate an online trading platform for retail 
  customers to trade a wide range of binary options internationally with more 
  than 100 different assets including indices, international stocks, commodities 
  and currency pairs (“Trading Platform”).

  The Trading Platform enables retail customers to trade binary options in more 
  than 30 countries. It is accessible from multiple operating systems (Windows, 
  smartphones (iOS and Android) and tablets) and the internet. The Trading Platform 
  has been self-developed and is proprietary. The Trading Platform has been designed 
  to be as intuitive and as easy to use as possible. The Trading Platform has 
  been localized into multiple languages.

  In June 2013, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (“CYSEC”) 
  authorized us to freely provide our services in all European Union (“EU”) 
  member states where CYSEC has informed each country's competent authority. As 
  a result we now operate in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
  Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, 
  Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, 
  Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
  To comply with United States federal securities laws and U.S. Commodity Futures 
  Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulations, we prohibit U.S. and Canadian 
  persons from using our Trading Platform. We utilize geo-targeting, which is 
  the method of determining the country of the website visitor based on his or 
  her address. Even if the website visitor uses a virtual private network or some 
  other method of Internet Protocol which will prevent us from correctly identifying 
  his or her country, we have additional layers of security, in the form of credit 
  card/bank account identification, proof of address such as a current utility 
  bill, and copies of a passport from each potential user to further ensure that 
  he or she does not reside in the United States.
The Binary Options Market

  A binary option is a type of option where the payoff is straightforward – 
  it pays back either some fixed amount of a trade or nothing at all. The two 
  main types of binary options are the cash-or-nothing binary option and the asset-or-nothing 
  binary option. The cash-or-nothing binary option pays some fixed amount of cash 
  if the option expires “in-the-money” while the asset-or-nothing 
  pays the value of the underlying security. Thus, the options are binary in nature 
  because there are only two possible outcomes. They are also called all-or-nothing 
  options, digital options and fixed return options.

  A binary option is an option with a predetermined expiration time. At the expiration 
  of the option period the customer either wins or loses. There is no automatic 
  exercise feature since the options are of binary nature and the customer does 
  not end up with a position in the underlying asset.

  Once a customer enters into a contract neither we nor the customer can change 
  the contract.
Unlike “regular” options that are offered by different exchanges 
  and which are contracts where the customer pays for the right to buy or sell 
  an underlying asset at a given price, an online binary option is a contract 
  where the customer pays for the right to receive a fixed return in case the 
  price of the underlying asset ends up higher or lower than the strike price. 
  The fixed return is attached to a particular asset and the customer has the 
  ability to see the potential payout prior to entering into a certain option 
  contract. The customer does not have the ability to determine the percentage 
  of return on such contract, however the customer sees the exact payout ratio 
  via the Trading Platform.

We intend to grow our customer base further and increase the proportion of 
  customers who trade frequently and for a longer period of time, resulting in 
  an increase in the number of trades executed on the Trading Platform. We intend 
  to do this by increasing brand awareness and business intelligence and attracting 
  more customers in regulated markets, to and retaining more customers on, the 
  Trading Platform. We believe that increased brand awareness with business intelligence 
  will generate greater average deposit per user (“ADPU”) by improving 
  our perception by customers and hence willingness to trade on the Trading Platform 
  with greater frequency and in greater quantum. We believe that increased brand 
  awareness alongside with deep business intelligence has the potential to improve 
  the margin between ADPU and average user acquisition cost (“AUAC”).

  We also intend to increase our customer base through entry into new markets. 
  Where appropriate, we will also consider setting up local offices or subsidiaries 
  in such markets and to extend our product and technology offering.

  We intend to further update the number of financial assets offered for binary 
  options trading on the Trading Platform. We believe that by adjusting the product 
  portfolio, we will attract more relevant customers to the Trading Platform resulting 
  in a variety of trading activity.

  We have extended our Trading Platform and it is now available on many leading 
  mobile devices. We strongly believe that our ability to deliver the most advanced 
  and reliable mobile platform will enable us to continue to have a leading position 
  in the market place.

(OTCQX: EZTD) With a Price Target of $0.81AccesswireFebruary 17, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / February 17, 2016 / SeeThruEquity, a leading independent equity research and corporate access firm focused on smallcap and microcap public companies, today announced it has initiated coverage on EZTD Inc. (EZTD) with a price target of $0.81.The report is available here: EZTD Initiation Report. SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor on Thomson First Call, Capital IQ, FactSet, and Zack's. The report will be available on these platforms. The firm also contributes its estimates to Thomson Estimates, the leading estimates platform on Wall Street.Based in Tel Aviv, Israel, EZTD, Inc. (EZTD) is a leading provider of binary options trading services. Formerly EZtrader, Inc., EZTD was one of the early regulated binary options trading service providers. EZTD registered with the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) in 2013, which allowed it to offer binary options trading online to most European Union (EU) countries. Since that time EZTD has emerged as a leading binary options player in the retail market, offering binary options services in 11 languages and more than 30 countries while experiencing robust volume and user growth."EZTD has made considerable progress over the last year, in particular. The company has grown its top line by 36% year-to-date with revenues already reaching $19.5mn in the first three quarters of the year. Impressively, while investing in growth, EZTD has generated positive adjusted EBITDA, enhanced its product offerings by increasing tradable assets and extending a consistent user interface across multiple mobile device environments, and listed company shares on the OTCQX exchange. We see several potential growth catalysts ahead for the company in 2016E and beyond driven by compelling new marketing initiatives to accelerate user growth, new products, and potential geographic expansion," stated Ajay Tandon, CEO of SeeThruEquity. "We are initiating coverage with a 12-month price target of $0.81 per share."Additional highlights from the report are as follows:Pure play on burgeoning binary options marketIn our view, EZTD is an intriguing pure play on the burgeoning online market for binary options trading. Binary options are options contracts, usually call or put contracts, in which the payouts depend entirely upon the outcome of a yes / no proposition. The yes / no proposition typically relates to whether the price of an asset that underlies a binary option will rise above or fall below a specified amount by a predetermined expiration time. Through subsidiary companies incorporated in Tel Aviv, Israel and Nicosia, Cyprus, EZTD has 120 employees and operates three main online brands – eztrader.com, globaloption.com, EZinvest.com - which provide secure, regulated, online trading platform for binary options trading. EZTD's brands utilize the company's proprietary, self-developed technology to provide a comprehensive binary option trading for retail customers. The product can be accessed 24/7 and real time pricing and a sophisticated, intuitive back-office tool for account monitoring that extends across a number of device types to enable binary options trading on more than 120 assets including commodities, currency pairs, indexes, and stocks.Strong revenue trends buoyed by growth in users and volumeWe see EZTD as an online growth company in which the key to generating long-term robust free cash flow is to achieve a critical mass of users and trading volume, such that the company is established as a premier online provider of binary options trading. Given that the binary options market appears to be in the early stages of growth and is fragmented, in our opinion the best way to gauge EZTD's progress towards this goal is to monitor active users, volume on the EZTD platform, and revenue. For the first three quarters of the year, EZTD's volume rose by 57% to reach $61.8mn, while revenues climbed 36% to $19.5mn. At the end of the September quarter, EZTD had 43,000 active customers, up significantly from 28,878 during 2014. These impressive growth figures support the company's claim that it is emerging as a leading player in the online binary options market.Please review important disclosures at www.seethruequity.com.Read MoreAbout EZTD Inc.EZTD Inc.
