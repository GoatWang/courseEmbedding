WHEEL OF FOURTUNE TRUE 3DÂ®

Classic reel themes and the iconic Wheel combine with the multi-dimensional play sensation of TRUE 3DÂ® for a gaming experience that appeals to current brand fans and attracts new ones.
Wheel of Fortune True 3D Reels offers unique game merchandising, with custom trim kit, LED lit wheel surround, game controlled side lighting, and an eye-catching LCD topper and crown antler configuration.
This game features a 3X3 configuration with forced five lines + fourth Bonus Reel. Available wager levels include: one, three and five âcoin options. Higher wagers activate more bonuses on the 4th Bonus reel.
At one coin, 5 lines are played. At a three-coin bet level, players are eligible for the COIN Bonus, Free Games Bonus and 2X base game Multiplier. And, at a five-coin level, Players are eligible for all Bonuses and Multipliers plus the Wheel Spin Bonus. Reels are 3D, so players will see the full depth and rotation of the reels as if they were real mechanical reels; some symbols will appear slightly raised and textured, and are presented in 3D space. All bonus features are awarded from the fourth Bonus Reel.

Located near the NorthWest Entrance

Elvira- Mistress of the Darkâ¢
Puts a new spin on the iconic horror hostess and celebrates her 35 years as a cultural icon of everything spooky. Filled with images, sounds, and video of the Mistress herself and is a feature rich exploration of your darker side. Cluster Power increases the ways to win, where clusters of symbols pay horizontally and vertically. Popular Reel Growth features randomly increasing symbol positions for potential big wins. Plus, Elviraâs Dual Big Wheels combine credit and multiplier wheels for a chance to spin and win big.Â 
Located near the NorthWest Entrance

DRAGON SPINâ¢
This eye-catching Asian-themed graphics highlight an amazing game!
This game features:
Mystery Stacks feature, Progressive pick feature, and Dragon Sin Bonus feature.
Locking Wilds free games, Raining Wilds free games, and Reel Blast free games.
Located near the NorthWest Entrance

LIGHTNING LINKâ¢
IntroducingÂ Lightning Link, an explosive set of linked games with progressives that are sure to be a hit. Multiple denominations call to players of all levels. Theyâll love the four game themesâand theyâll be on the edge of their seats waiting for the free games and Hold & Spin bonuses to strike. Especially when a single bonus spin could award multiple progressives and bonus values.
Located near the NorthWest Entrance

Plants vs. Zombiesâ¢ 3D Ancient Egypt
Is a new TRUE 3D title that immerses players in lively plants and zombies battles. The colorful theme slot machine includes four interactive bonus events, including the iconic âZombie Uprising Bonus.â
Located near the Cottonwood Bar

GAME OF THRONESâ¢
Weâve captured all the drama, spectacle and rich detail of the EmmyÂ® award-winning Game of Thronesâ¢ and transformed it into an unforgettable gaming experience. With terrifying dragons, epic battles, stirring music and characters both revered and reviled, players will be engrossed in the action of this four-level progressive game with multi-site progressive jackpot.
Located near the NorthWest Entrance

Duck Dynasty
On the reels you will find a wide range of symbols, including all of the main characters. There are also ducks, fish and deer. Many times, the symbols will come stacked (in lines of 4 covering every spot on a reel), this gives you the opportunity to line up multiple wins at the same time â especially when there are wild symbols included. The stomping country style music from the show also crosses over to the slot, giving you that feel-good feeling while you play. Animations move to the next level when you hit the bonus rounds. These are interactive, and involve things like shooting arrows or choosing a duck-call. There is a giant spinning wheel which youâll use to randomly select your bonus each time one is triggered.

Four proposals for casino projects in southeast Kansas were submitted to state officials by the Jan. 30 deadline. Two are clearly larger and glitzier, sitting a few feet from the Oklahoma and Missouri state lines and catering mainly to out-of-state residents. The other two are smaller, though still large, and would sit 30 to 40 miles farther north, near southeast Kansasâ most populous city, Pittsburg.

Kansas casino proposals offer distinct choices for gamblers and state

When there are big bets on the line, you can expect strong opinions and plenty of controversy.
Four proposals for casino projects in southeast Kansas were submitted to state officials by the Jan. 30 deadline. Two are clearly larger and glitzier, sitting a few feet from the Oklahoma and Missouri state lines and catering mainly to out-of-state residents. The other two are smaller, though still large, and would sit 30 to 40 miles farther north, near southeast Kansasâ most populous city, Pittsburg. 
The four are: Castle Rock Casino Resort, Emerald City Casino Resort, Kansas Crossing Casino & Hotel, and a still-unnamed project by Southeast Kansas Casino Partners LLC. 
The four are now being studied by the Kansas Lottery, which are applying various criteria, including financial sufficiency. If approved, the proposals would pass in April to an independent board called the Lottery Gaming Facility Review Board, which is expected to name a winner by the end of June. 
Ken Coleman, of Southeast Kansas Casino Partners, said that the best project for Kansas would pull most of its customers from a multi-state region that includes Springfield and Joplin, Mo., and Fayetteville, Ark., rather than from southeast Kansas. Pulling in customers from outside the state means having nonresidents paying tax dollars into Kansas coffers. 




To capture those gamblers, he said, the casino must be placed as close as possible to I-44, the main highway between Springfield and Tulsa, which runs less than a mile from the stateâs southeast corner. Castle Rock, the other casino proposed in that location, said its market study showed that 75 percent of its visitors would be from out of state.
But the big problem for both projects is they would compete head-on with Downstream Casino Resort, a giant casino complex sitting just across the state line in Oklahoma. Downstream is owned by the Qupaw Tribe of northeastern Oklahoma. 
The Qupaw Tribe also backs one of the southeast Kansas casinos proposed for the Pittsburg area. That project would sit on the former greyhound race track in Frontenac, owned by Wichita businessman Phil Ruffin.
In a move that could change some calculations, the Qupaw Tribe in December got approval from the National Indian Gaming Commission to expand Downstream Casino across the Kansas state line, with a $15 million addition that would offer table games such as craps and roulette that are not allowed in Oklahoma. The Cherokee County Commission this week formally voted to oppose such a move.
Brandon Steven said his groupâs proposal, Castle Rock Casino, is not affected by the Qupaw Tribeâs move.



âThereâs a slim chance theyâll get it,â Steven said. âAnd, really, it doesnât affect us, whether theyâre 20 feet closer to us is irrelevant, weâre still going to build.â
John Berrey, chairman of the Qupaw Tribe, said a direct competitor canât beat Downstream, and that the addition would allow it to offer all the games a Kansas casino can. Because Downstream is tribe-owned, he said, it pays less in taxes, which means he can spend more to compete and still make the same profit. 
He sees the tribeâs Emerald Casino Resort in Frontenac as a nice complement to Downstream. It would pull from the area, but reach all the way up to the Kansas City area on both sides of the Kansas-Missouri line. 
Carrie Tedore, spokeswoman for the Kansas Crossing Casino, said her group made decisions about location and size based on previous experience winning two of the three competitions for casinos in Kansas. Some of the same parties involved in Kansas Crossing helped develop the Kansas Star Casino in Mulvane and the Boot Hill Casino & Resort in Dodge City.
Tedore said they think their location, at one of the busiest intersections in southeast Kansas, was the right place, and that they have the right size to thrive in that region. Itâs a casino, she said, but itâs also an entertainment complex that would provide economic development for the Pittsburg area with an arena, hotel, restaurants and other amenities.

FRN Registration

Before using ULS, you must first register with the FCC's Commission Registration System (CORES) to receive an FCC Registration
      Number (FRN). Click the Register button on the ULS Home page to access CORES for your FRN. Follow the onscreen prompts and instructions, providing the password information requested
      by CORES. CORES will present you with a confirmation page. We recommend printing this page for your records -- you will need
      to use your FRN and password to apply for and manage licenses within ULS and register antenna structures within ASR. Under
      the heading, "To continue on to another FCC Filing system," choose the ULS link to return to ULS.
   
Once you have completed your registration, use the Log In button on the ULS Home page to associate call signs with your FRN. To associate ASR numbers with your FRN, use the Log In button on the ASR Home page To update your CORES registration at any time, click on the Register button on the ULS Home page or the ASR Home page.

ULS Online Filing

If you have registered in CORES and wish to use ULS for online application filing, click on the Log In button (located on the ULS Home page) to begin the electronic filing process. ULS will load the appropriate online application form based on the purpose of the
      application and radio service you select. For more details, please see Getting Started 2. File: Using ULS online filing. 
   
Please Note: The copy of your filing resulting from Print Preview in ULS may be submitted to the FCC for manual filing ONLY
      if it is a complete application with the addition dates printed clearly at the bottom of the page. 
   
 Return to Top
Application Search

The Application Search button (located on the ULS Home page) enables you to search for specific wireless service applications submitted within ULS. You can view applications, associated
      schedules, attachments, status information, and historical data. For more details, please see Getting Started 3. Search.
   
 Return to Top
License Search

Use the License Search button (located on the ULS Home page) to search the ULS database for specific licenses. You can view the status, special conditions, comments, technical information,
      history, and associated applications and attachments for each license. For more details, please see Getting Started 3. Search. 
   
 Return to Top
Archive License Search

Use the Archives button (located on the ULS Home page) to link to the Archive License Search. The ULS License Archive Search enables you to search for prior versions of a license
      as well as the current version. Each time a license is acted upon, the current version is captured within ULS creating a "snapshot"
      history of the license and its modifications. Searching these archived versions allows you to see the exact status of a license
      at various points in time. The search interface uses the same display as ULS Advanced License Search and allows you to search
      on many of the same criteria.  Note: The ULS data warehouse stores archived licenses for radio services converted to ULS beginning
      in August 1999 or, if the service was converted to ULS after August 1999, from the date the service was converted. Licenses
      from previous wireless databases are not archived in the license warehouse.

      filing Ownership Information electronically, consult the online help files that are part of the electronic filing system.

Interested parties may submit petitions and informal objections (pleadings) regarding ULS applications or licenses. If there is a pleading regarding an application or license, the ULS Application and License Search results will display
      the type of pleading, the title of the pleading, and the date the pleading was submitted. You may also view the pleading (except
      for confidential pleadings).

History[edit]
In 2007, the state enacted the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, which included authorization for four casinos to be built and managed by private developers, under contract with the Kansas Lottery.[1] One of the casinos was allocated to the Wichita area (Sedgwick and Sumner Counties).[1]
The law required a local referendum in each county before a casino could be approved. This requirement was waived for Sumner County because it had passed an advisory measure in favor of casino gaming in 2005.[2] The referendum failed in Sedgwick County, leaving Sumner County as the area's only possible casino site.[3]
Casino proposals in Sumner County were divided between Wellington, the largest town in the county, and Mulvane, which was 14 miles closer to the area's main population center, Wichita.[4] The first round of proposals in 2008 resulted in the selection of Harrah's Entertainment over two other bidders, but Harrah's then withdrew because of factors stemming from the global financial crisis.[4] A new selection process opened in 2009 and drew three applicants,[4] but all eventually withdrew their proposals.[5]
A third bidding process opened in April 2010,[6] again drawing three bidders. Harrah's and Peninsula Gaming each proposed a casino to be built in Mulvane, and Global Gaming proposed a casino in Wellington.[7] Harrah's again withdrew its application,[8] and Peninsula Gaming was then selected as the winner over Global Gaming in December 2010.[9]
The casino opened in a temporary facility on December 26, 2011.[10][11] The permanent casino facility opened in December 2012.[12] The property's hotel, a Hampton Inn, opened with 150 rooms in October 2012,[13] and expanded to 300 rooms in August 2014.[14] The temporary casino building was converted to its permanent use as a 3,400-seat arena,[15] with an inaugural concert by Daughtry in June 2013.[16]
Facilities[edit]
The casino has several eateries and bars, including a buffet, a steakhouse, and an Asian restaurant.
The Kansas Star Arena is a multipurpose entertainment venue that has hosted concerts by notable performing artists, as well as the Miss Kansas USA pageant, mixed martial arts events by Bellator MMA, and equestrian events including Championship Bull Riding and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. The Event Center Ballroom is a smaller theater that presents more intimate shows.

History[edit]
In 2007, the state enacted the Kansas Expanded Lottery Act, which included authorization for four casinos to be built and managed by private developers, under contract with the Kansas Lottery.[1] One of the casinos was allocated to the Wichita area (Sedgwick and Sumner Counties).[1]
The law required a local referendum in each county before a casino could be approved. This requirement was waived for Sumner County because it had passed an advisory measure in favor of casino gaming in 2005.[2] The referendum failed in Sedgwick County, leaving Sumner County as the area's only possible casino site.[3]
Casino proposals in Sumner County were divided between Wellington, the largest town in the county, and Mulvane, which was 14 miles closer to the area's main population center, Wichita.[4] The first round of proposals in 2008 resulted in the selection of Harrah's Entertainment over two other bidders, but Harrah's then withdrew because of factors stemming from the global financial crisis.[4] A new selection process opened in 2009 and drew three applicants,[4] but all eventually withdrew their proposals.[5]
A third bidding process opened in April 2010,[6] again drawing three bidders. Harrah's and Peninsula Gaming each proposed a casino to be built in Mulvane, and Global Gaming proposed a casino in Wellington.[7] Harrah's again withdrew its application,[8] and Peninsula Gaming was then selected as the winner over Global Gaming in December 2010.[9]
The casino opened in a temporary facility on December 26, 2011.[10][11] The permanent casino facility opened in December 2012.[12] The property's hotel, a Hampton Inn, opened with 150 rooms in October 2012,[13] and expanded to 300 rooms in August 2014.[14] The temporary casino building was converted to its permanent use as a 3,400-seat arena,[15] with an inaugural concert by Daughtry in June 2013.[16]
Facilities[edit]
The casino has several eateries and bars, including a buffet, a steakhouse, and an Asian restaurant.
The Kansas Star Arena is a multipurpose entertainment venue that has hosted concerts by notable performing artists, as well as the Miss Kansas USA pageant, mixed martial arts events by Bellator MMA, and equestrian events including Championship Bull Riding and the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. The Event Center Ballroom is a smaller theater that presents more intimate shows.
