CounterPath Corporation is a Canadian company that designs, develops and sells software and services that enable enterprises and telecommunication service providers to deliver unified communications services over Internet Protocol (IP)-based networks.

History[edit]
Founded in 2002 as Xten, the company was an early influencer of SIP standards through the IETF and launched their first commercial product, the X-PRO SIP softphone in 2003.[2][3] The company changed its name in 2005 to CounterPath Solutions, then again in 2007 to CounterPath Corporation. CounterPath sells and markets its products through channel partners, direct sales and its online store to businesses. Their flagship product is the Bria softphone, a client suite that offers over-the-top unified communications across fixed and mobile networks.[4] The company claims that their freeware product, X-Lite, has been downloaded by millions of users.[5] Service provider customers include AT&T, Avaya, BroadSoft, Cisco Systems, Comcast, Ericsson, GENBAND, Rogers Communications and Verizon.[6] The company also holds several patents for VoIP, FMC and Unified Communications technologies.[7]
Management[edit]
CounterPath’s executive team is led by President and CEO Donovan Jones and governed by a Board of Directors.[8] The Chairman of the Board is Terry Matthews, co-founder of Mitel. He is also the founder and Chairman of Wesley Clover, a private investment vehicle and holding company.
Acquisitions[edit]
CounterPath acquired three companies since its inception:

February 2008: BridgePort Networks [9]
August 2007: NewHeights Software [10]
February 2008: FirstHand Technologies [11]

The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at CounterPath Corporation in April 2014.InterviewI was originally seeked out by a recruiting company from outside counterpath, however, counterpath was good about gathering more information from me if needed. Once the recruiter made her thorough pass with me via email and a phone screen, she set up a phone screen with the hiring manager. As the phone screen with the hiring manager was coming to a close, he mentioned he would be at the local location for the day (in a few days) and if we could meet then. The in person was uneventful - meet the team, discuss the product(s) and the role to be filled to include skill set matches.Interview Questions After the in person interview, was asked to provide a test plan based on requirements provided.   Answer Question CounterPath Corporation 2014-08-21 12:52 PDT See All 8 InterviewsCompany Updates CEO Donovan Jones on BNN—30+ days agoBNN Interview with CounterPath's President and CEO Donovan JonesBusiness Network News interviews Donovan Jones, President and CEO of CounterPath, about the company and its graduation to the TSX.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
