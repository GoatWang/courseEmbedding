                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

This OMNIBUS AMENDMENT TO INDENTURE
SUPPLEMENTS, dated as of July 29, 2016 (this “
Amendment ”), to the Indenture Supplements (as
hereinafter described) to the Second Amended and Restated
Indenture, dated as of July 29, 2016 (as amended and restated and
as otherwise modified from time to time, the “
Indenture ”), between American Express Issuance Trust
II, a statutory trust organized under the laws of the State of
Delaware, as Issuer (the “ Issuer ”), and The
Bank of New York Mellon, a New York banking corporation, as
Indenture Trustee (in such capacity, the “ Indenture
Trustee ”) and as Securities Intermediary, is made and
entered into as of July 29, 2016.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee have previously entered into (i) the Series
2013-1 Indenture Supplement, dated as of March 21, 2013 (the
“ Series 2013-1 Indenture Supplement ”), to the
Indenture, and (ii) the Series 2013-2 Indenture Supplement, dated
as of September 24, 2013 (the “ Series 2013-2 Indenture
Supplement ” and, together with the Series 2013-1
Indenture Supplement, the “ Indenture Supplements
”); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 10.01
of the Indenture, the parties hereto desire to amend each Indenture
Supplement as provided herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual agreements herein contained, and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, each party hereto agrees as follows:

ARTICLE I

DEFINITIONS

SECTION 2.01. Amendments to
Section 1.01 . The following subsection (f) is hereby
inserted in Section 1.01 of each Indenture Supplement, it being
understood that any reference to “Series 20[

designation:

(f) Series 201[
     ]-[     
] shall be an Investor Communication Reporting Series.



SECTION 2.02. Amendment to
Section 4.14 . Sections 4.14(a) and 4.14(b) of each Indenture
Supplement are hereby deleted and replaced with the
following:

(a) Any investment instructions
required to be given to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms
hereof must be given to the Indenture Trustee no later than 10:30
a.m. (New York City time) on the date such investment is to be
made. In the event the Indenture Trustee receives such

the Indenture Trustee receives an investment instruction later than
the time required by the first sentence of this paragraph (a), and
the Indenture Trustee is unable to make the applicable investment
on the date specified in such investment instruction, such
investment shall be made by the Indenture Trustee on the next

Trustee be liable for any investment not made pursuant to
investment instructions received after 10:30 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date such investment is to be made.

(b) With respect to investments made
by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the terms hereof, the Servicer
may appoint as its agent under a separate agreement a registered
investment advisor and authorize such agent to give instructions,
which may be provided to the Indenture Trustee through S.W.I.F.T.,
on behalf of the Servicer to the Indenture Trustee for funds to be
invested and reinvested in one or more Eligible
Investments. The Servicer shall provide the Indenture Trustee
with a written direction certifying any such appointment. The
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on, and
shall be protected in acting upon, instructions, which may be
provided to the Indenture Trustee through S.W.I.F.T. received from
such agent on behalf of the Servicer.

SECTION 2.03. Amendment to
Exhibits . Form of Monthly Servicer Statement under
Exhibit B-1 to each Indenture Supplement is hereby deleted
and replaced with the form attached as Exhibit A to this
Amendment.

Indenture Supplements . As amended by this Amendment, the
Indenture Supplements are in all respects ratified and confirmed
and each Indenture Supplement, as amended by this Amendment, shall
be read, taken and construed as one and the same
instrument.

SECTION 3.02. Counterparts
. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts,
