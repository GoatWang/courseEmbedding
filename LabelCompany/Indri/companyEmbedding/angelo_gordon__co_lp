Real Estate Private Equity
REAL ESTATE Strategies




OVERVIEW
Angelo, Gordon began investing in commercial real estate in 1993 and has acquired over $13 billion of properties. The firm focuses on a value-added approach through the acquisition of sub-performing real estate properties across a broad range of geographical markets and product types. These assets are often attractively priced due to the lack of operating income, complexity of analysis, and inefficiency of the sales process. With real estate professionals in our offices in New York, Los Angeles, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo we have a global view of the market, with a strong emphasis on the United States and Asia. We manage real estate assets in two distinct disciplines. Our opportunistic real estate strategy focuses on properties where a great deal of repositioning and renovation is usually required to stabilize the asset and which target a higher rate of return than our more conservative core plus real estate strategy. Our core plus real estate strategy focuses on higher quality assets, which, despite their sub-performance, generate significant current income from operations. Generally, we will work in tandem with one of many local operating partners to source real estate deals and correct the asset's under-performance. Our real estate team's experience encompasses all aspects of real estate investment and management, including acquisition, financing, disposition, leasing, and construction management. Our real estate investment professionals have hands-on operational real estate expertise that has proved to be critical to our success in acquiring and repositioning assets.

CONSISTENT, ABSOLUTE RETURNS
Identifying Opportunities
There are periods when a market, sector or security becomes mispriced because investors do not recognize its true value or do not have the platform or network to access the opportunity. These periods may be long- or short-lived, but in either case an investor can benefit from these inefficiencies.  Angelo, Gordon has a long history of identifying and successfully exploiting mispricings in securities and assets, through rigorous and extensive analysis of company and industry fundamentals. Research is the cornerstone of Angelo, Gordon’s investment process. Our firm has more than 160 investment professionals working together. Over the years, we have built an extensive network of relationships which provides us with substantial deal flow. We are in an excellent position to capitalize on the best investment ideas at any time.
Protecting Capital
Our focus on fundamental research is complemented by strict adherence to our disciplined style — focus on the downside, diversify and use leverage judiciously.  Our philosophy is that by understanding the potential downside or loss of an investment, and sizing our positions accordingly, we will be able to generate above-average returns with low volatility over a long period of time.
Managing Risk
In addition to the risk management techniques employed by the portfolio managers of each strategy (fundamental research, diversification, etc.), the firm has an independent risk management group which analyzes the exposures and activities within portfolios. The risk management team takes an integrated approach to analyze market, credit and operational risk across all of Angelo, Gordon’s portfolios.  Angelo, Gordon’s Chief Risk Officer and staff maintain a comprehensive risk management framework, which includes well-defined policies, through bottom-up analysis, daily portfolio monitoring and regular evaluation of capital adequacy and performance forecasts. The risk management group operates independently to ensure that all activities in the firm are performed in a fair and transparent manner.  The risk management group is responsible for reviewing all systems, products and pricing models. The group also reviews the weekly price variance reports, the weekly and quarterly fair market valuations, quarterly best execution reports, and performs counterparty credit analysis for all brokers. The Chief Risk Officer also ensures that the anti-money laundering/OFAC reviews are performed and chairs the brokerage, valuation and disaster recovery/business continuity committees.
Investment Process
Angelo, Gordon has significant analytical experience in both equity and debt markets. In addition, we have internal industry specialists and outside partners with expertise in specific fields. We use this wealth of internal and external resources to come up with ideas and analyze investment opportunities that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns.




					"We have an excellent track record of over 28 years of investing across a broad range of alternative investment strategies."

History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

Awards and recognition[edit]
Angelo, Gordon’s portfolio managers have in recent years been noted for top performance in their investment strategies. Angelo, Gordon’s CMBS fund and the non-investment grade corporate credit fund were recognized by Bloomberg for Best Performance for Directional Fixed Income (2011-2014.) [26] The RMBS/ABS fund appeared in Barron’s Top 100 Hedge Funds in 2013[27] and in 2014.[28] Angelo, Gordon’s flagship multistrategy fund appeared in Business Insider’s 100 Most Successful Hedge Funds in 2012,[29] Bloomberg ‘s 100 Top Performing Large Hedge Funds in 2013[30] and won the award for CreditFlux Best Credit Multistrategy in 2014.[31][32]

History[edit]
John Angelo and Michael Gordon founded the firm on strategies with which they had 15 years prior experience: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and convertible arbitrage. The multi-strategy platform was added in 1993 as a way to offer investors a single fund which captured many of Angelo, Gordon’s investment strategies and which could tactically allocate as markets shifted. In 1998, the leveraged loan business was added as an extension of the distressed debt business.[4][8]
The firm began buying real estate as early as 1990 through investments in the distressed debt of bankrupt real estate companies. In 1993, as real estate markets buckled under the weight of too much debt, the firm launched its opportunistic real estate strategy investments with the goal of improving and repositioning the property by increasing operating income.[3]
In early 2002, the company added core plus real estate to its real estate strategies as it was able to benefit from its operating partner network, and purchase high quality real estate.[3] Since 2005, the firm has expanded its real estate offerings through a dedicated opportunistic Asian real estate strategy.[9] In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 and the European banking crisis of 2011, Angelo, Gordon added European real estate to its strategies as prices were depressed and liquidity was severely curtailed in the region.[10]
Net Lease real estate strategy was established in 2005 to focus on below investment grade tenants.[11] Angelo, Gordon further expanded into the intersections of real estate and credit with the addition of real estate debt in 2006[12] and residential and consumer debt in 2008.[13]
In 2009, Angelo, Gordon was one of only nine private investment firms to partner with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in PPIP—the Private-Public Investment Partnership.[14] The U.S. government invested alongside the selected firms to unlock the frozen credit markets in the wake of the global financial crisis.[15] This was a successful program.[16][17][18]
The firm took advantage of the post-2008 financial crisis contraction in bank lending to smaller companies through senior secure direct lending to energy companies in 2013[19] and to middle market borrowers in the private equity sponsor community in 2014.[20]
In October 2013, Larry Schloss became the president of Angelo, Gordon and Co.[21] In March 2016, Mr. Schloss left the firm.[22]
Co-founder John M Angelo died in 2016.[23]

Angelo, Gordon Bolsters Real Estate Marketing and Client Service Teams




Adds Seasoned Executives Terri Herubin and Matthew Brody






July 18, 2017 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Angelo, Gordon & Co., the $28 billion alternative investment firm 
      focused on credit and real estate investing, today announced that the 
      firm has bolstered its real estate marketing and client service teams 
      with the addition of two senior executives. Terri Herubin, former 
      Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Barings Real Estate, has 
      joined the firm as a Managing Director. Ms. Herubin oversees client 
      service for the firm’s real estate portfolios and serves as the real 
      estate product specialist for the firm. Matthew Brody, former Principal 
      at Walton Street Capital, has joined the firm as a Managing Director, 
      responsible for new business development for the firm’s real estate 
      activities. Ms. Herubin and Mr. Brody are based in New York.
    


      “Terri and Matt are both highly-accomplished industry executives and we 
      are pleased to welcome them to Angelo, Gordon,” said Gareth Henry, 
      Global Head of Investor Relations. Aliana Spungen, who has overseen the 
      firm’s real estate marketing and client service efforts since 1999, 
      added, “Terri’s unique skillset, which spans real estate product 
      development, fund management and client service, coupled with Matt’s 
      experience with the real estate investment community, will bolster our 
      capabilities as we further strengthen relationships and expand the 
      solutions we provide for our clients.”
    

      Ms. Herubin added: “Angelo, Gordon has long been recognized for its 
      unwavering commitment to putting its clients first. I am thrilled to 
      work alongside this talented team to meet the evolving needs of the 
      firm’s real estate clients.”
    

      Mr. Brody concluded: “Angelo, Gordon’s reputation in the real estate 
      industry is built on its successful value-added approach across a broad 
      range of real estate investment strategies. I look forward to working 
      closely with the team to further engage the investment community and 
      share our fund offerings with our investment partners.”

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
