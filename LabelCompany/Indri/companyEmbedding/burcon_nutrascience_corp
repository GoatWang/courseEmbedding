Burcon NutraScience Announces Receipt Of Nasdaq Letter Regarding Deficiency In Compliance With Certain Listing Rules
Jun 14 17
Burcon NutraScience Corporation (Burcon or Company) announced that on June 8, 2017, the Company received a letter from the Listings Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450 (b)(2), which requires the listed securities of the Company to maintain a minimum market value of US$50,000,000.  The Company has not met this requirement for a period of 30 consecutive business days.  The Nasdaq notification letter does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's common shares, and the shares will continue to trade uninterrupted. The Company has a compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until December 5, 2017, to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum market value of listed securities requirement. If at any time during the compliance period the Company’s market value of listed securities closes at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide Burcon with a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. Burcon’s management is reviewing various options available to the Company, including regaining compliance and continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market or applying for a transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market.

	Burcon NutraScience Corporation has taken reasonable care in preparing and publishing information on this web site on a regular basis. The information is not a substitute for detailed investigation or analysis on any particular issue and may not always be current. The contents of this web site are not and should not be used as a substitute for independent professional advice in making an investment decision, and Burcon NutraScience Corporation will not be responsible for any loss or damage arising from the use of this information.

	The principal business objective of Burcon NutraScience Corporation is to commercialize its patented and patent-pending technologies for protein from soybean meal and canola meal. The technologies are at an early stage of development and the company's future financial performance largely depends on the successful development of commercial products. Technological development has very high risks and there is no assurance that Burcon NutraScience Corporation's extraction technology will ever be commercialized, or that Burcon NutraScience Corporation will be able to develop markets for its products. Burcon NutraScience Corporation has not generated revenues from its operations since inception in 1998. Although its technology is protected by patents and pending patents, Burcon NutraScience Corporation is subject to competition from other corporations which have greater financial and technical resources.

	To the extent that any statements in this web site deal with information that is not historical, these statements are necessarily forward looking. As such, they are subject to the occurrence of many events outside of Burcon NutraScience Corporation's control and are subject to various risk factors that could cause Burcon NutraScience Corporation's results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement. The risk factors include, without limitation, the inherent risk of competition in the marketplace, outcomes in product trial studies, regulatory risks and risks related to proprietary rights and market acceptance. Differences may result from: a loss of key personnel; from an inability to raise sufficient capital to pay for technology development; from technological failure; from an inability to complete or maintain alliances with other companies; from an inability to effectively demonstrate or market the technology; from an inability to manufacture products with an acceptable cost and quality; from developments in world markets for protein, food ingredients or nutraceuticals; from local, regional or national political developments in Canada; or from the timing of regulatory approvals and other factors.

Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.

Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares.

Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE."

For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share).

Weight Loss* Success: Which Weight Loss* Products Are Most Effective? | MedHealthDigest





























 






























Weight Loss* Success: Which Weight Loss* Products Are Most Effective? 
There’s no doubt that today, thin is in. For most people, though, trying to decrease their weight is a slow and difficult process. Sometimes it seems practically impossible to shed that extra 10, 20, or 30 pounds. The difficulties many people experience when trying to do this have spurred the development of the absolutely massive diet supplement industry. Those who manufacture these aids use before and after photos, user experience stories from real users, and claims that seem too good to be true to convince dieters that their product is the best of the literally hundreds on the market. Unfortunately, some companies make claims that are unfounded or even completely fabricated.

We know that trying to get trim is difficult enough without having to look at countless products to find the right one. To assist you with the selection process and your goals, we looked at numerous products to pinpoint exactly what users should be looking for in this type of dietary supplement. Despite the vast array of products, we found that all the best and most effective ones shared three characteristics. First, they were formulated with superior ingredients selected for their specific benefits. Remember, if a manufacturer is being truthful about what a product can do, they won’t make an effort to hide what’s actually in it. Instead, they will provide a full list of extracts in the formulation, indicate the concentrations of each one, and give you information about scientific research and clinical trials showing that the product is effective. Next, high quality supplements contain ingredients that address the metabolism and decrease in body fat. Finally, the best supplements are made with the problem of overeating in mind and may contain substances that help the user feel more satiated after eating.
On a final note, it’s important to remember that—despite what you see on television—the process of getting to a healthy weight is usually slow. If you’re losing about two pounds a week, you’re doing everything right. This way, you’re also more likely to be able to sustain your results. Starving yourself may help reach goals faster, but you’re more likely to give up and gain all your weight (and possibly then some) back when you feel deprived and hungry all the time. Follow the tips above and use a product that contains proven ingredients that are good quality, pure and made by a reputable manufacturer.

Multivitamins and other supplements can help make up the difference and prevent vitamin and mineral deficiencies. They can also provide more nutrients than diet alone, which may help to protect against or manage certain diseases. Find out a little bit more about what your body needs to stay healthy. What are the most essential vitamins? The following list of vitamins are essential for the body to function properly: Vitamin A is needed for healthy eyes, skin and skeletal tissue. Vitamin B1 (thiamin) helps the body use up fat and produce energy. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is an antioxidant that protects the body s cells protect against free radical damage. Vitamin B3 (niacin) may reduce the risk of heart disease. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) is important for hormone production, immune system health and energy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) helps protect the layer around cells. Vitamin B7 (biotin) aids the metabolism and promotes healthy skin, hair, nails and cells. Vitamin B9 (folate) is necessary for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is essential for the production of healthy red blood and nerve cells. vitamin C is essential for the growth and repair of body tissue. Vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and helps build healthy bones and optimal immune function. Vitamin E protects against free radicals and may also boost the immune system. Vitamin K may help the blood to clot and prevent excessive bleeding while keeping your heart healthy and your bones strong. Choline is important for liver function, nerve function and muscle movement. Optimize your immune system Your immune system serves to protect your body against infection and disease. What you put into our body affects your immune system, and a lack of selected micronutrients can lead to immune deficiency. Vitamins A, C and E help maintain the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts, which acts as a barrier against infection. Vitamin D works with certain white blood cells which are important to the immune system s ability to fight off infection and disease. Selenium acts as an antioxidant to help fight infection and protect the body against oxygen free radical damage. Probiotics help to maintain the integrity of the lining of the intestines, which help to boost immunity. Omega 3 fatty acids are essential for reducing inflammation. Some people have a higher risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. If you've lost weight recently, you may be deficient in a wide range of vitamins and minerals. Be sure to start taking a high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplement. These popular supplements come in a wide variety of forms: pills, capsules, chewable tablets, gummies, drinks (liquids and powders) and more. With so many options, it should be easy to find one that works for you. Vegetarians and vegans If you're a vegetarian, you may have deficiencies in protein, vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D, zinc, iodine, riboflavin, calcium and selenium. Vegans are especially likely to be low in protein, selenium and B12. In addition to a multivitamin and mineral supplement, you might want to consider adding a vegan-friendly protein shake or two to your daily regimen. There are a wide variety of shake powders on the market, typically available in, but not limited to, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors. One scoop of protein powder usually provides approximately 25 grams of protein, but it varies from one supplier to another. Macrobiotic diet If you're on a macrobiotic diet, which is fixed on ideas about the types of food drawn from Zen Buddhism, you may be deficient in vitamin B12, iron, vitamin D and other nutrients. The goal as a macrobiotic is to bring enlightenment, or healthy well-being, by teaching you how to thoughtfully choose what you eat. But it may come at a cost of some important vitamins. As with vegetarians and vegans, consider a solid multivitamin as a nutritional supplement. More support for seniors Seniors living in their own homes are often deficient in vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, calcium and zinc and occasionally vitamin B1 and vitamin B2. Older adults need more calcium and vitamin D to help maintain bone health. Try three daily servings of vitamin D-fortified low-fat or fat-free milk or yogurt. Other calcium-rich foods include fortified cereals and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables and canned fish. These are all great additions to your daily meals, but be sure to take a multivitamin with age-adjusted doses of nutrients for people aged 50 years and older. Workout warriors For those who like to workout with weights, supplements can aid the recovery process and build muscle. Strength training on a regular basis breaks down your muscles so they can grow back bigger and stronger. Be sure to have a solid meal plan, get plenty of rest between workouts, lots of water and consider a protein supplement in the form of powders that can be mixed or protein bars. You can also add creatine to help build muscle and a variety of other workout supplements to assist with your fitness goals. At Walmart, you'll find a wide selection of vitamins and other supplements to help you keep up with your nutritional needs. Save money.

Medications like prescription drugs and headache tablets are among the most likely things that you find in any medicine cabinet, but not the only things. Medicine takes many forms and can be in tubes, packets and bottles. There are medications specifically for adults, children and babies. Not everything found in a medicine cabinet is even medicine, although they are usually health-related. When you want to stock up your medicine cabinet, we have what you need, all at Every Day Low Prices.Pain relieversPain relievers come in three basic forms: aspirin, acetaminophen and Ibuprofen. A less common form is naproxen. For headaches and joint pain, acetaminophen, ibuprofen and naproxen are most effective. For muscle soreness use ibuprofen or naproxen. All four are effective on back, neck and shoulder pain and migraines.There are also specialty pain relievers that target joint and muscle pain, arthritis pain, menstrual cramps, urinary tract pain or migraine headaches. Some are designed specifically for children. Various pain relievers are designed for taking prior to going to bed since they cause drowsiness. These come in pill, caplet and capsule form and some children's mediation is available in flavored liquid form. There are also balms, creams and sprays that you can use for muscle and other topical pain.Cough, cold and fluWhen you or someone you love gets sick or is getting sick, it helps to have some medicine on hand to help ease the symptoms and lessen the severity and length of the illness. Items to have in your medicine cabinet include decongestants for stuffy noses and congested coughs, cough syrup and cough drops to treat coughs and sore throats, nasal sprays to relieve hay fever and allergy symptoms, chest rubs to reduce congestion and fever reducers to keep fevers from elevating too high. For chest congestion, an expectorant can help loosen phlegm and help you breathe and sleep better. Another item that can help reduce the severity of a cold is medicated vaporizing liquid (you will need an electric or battery-powered vaporizer).Digestion and nauseaFor people who deal with upset stomachs, diarrhea, indigestion and other stomach maladies, there are many medications to alleviate these issues. Antacids and over-the-counter drugs like omeprazole held relieve heartburn, either in pill, chewable tablet, or effervescent tablet form. Laxatives and stool softeners help relieve consitpation and are available in pill, liquid and suppository form. Fiber supplements and anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide, are designed to relieve diarrhea.There are also medications that can relieve several of these symptoms if they occur simultaneously. It's helpful to have medications that help relieve nausea or motion sickness.AllergiesAntihistamines and medications, such as fexofenadine, cetirizine, diphenhydramine and loratadine, all available over the counter at Walmart, can relive the symptoms associated with allergies. Whether you are afflicted by grass or tree pollens, pet dander or other air-borne substances, these medications can offer you relief for a few hours or all day. There are nasal sprays that offer immediate allergy relief as well.First aidJust like a fully stocked first aid kid, it always safe to be prepared and keep a good supply of first aid items handy in your medicine cabinet. There are numerous ointments and creams available that help heal cuts faster, relive the pain associated with burns and offer antibacterial and antibiotic properties. With many of these ointments, it is necessary to protect the affected area with bandages, and we have many different brands and styles.Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide are must-have items for keeping wounds clean and disinfected. For sprains, tape and flexible bandages can help add needed support. For sunburns, there are sprays and creams that lessen the pain and severity of the sunburn. Eye drops can help relieve eye pain, and eye wash can help clear the eyes of foreign objects.Other itemsThe list of other items that are useful in your home's medicine cabinet can run a wide gamut. Dental-related items like toothbrushes, toothpaste, dental floss and mouthwash are common items as are thermometers for checking temperatures. A well-stocked medicine cabinets helps you to be prepared for minor illnesses and first aid. Always talk with your doctor or pharmacist before taking any medications.
