Avenue Capital Raising Up To $1.25B For New Energy Fund
May 5 2015  |  10:45am ET

Avenue Capital has raised approximately $700 million towards a $1.25 billion cap for a new fund that will invest in energy-related opportunities.
The Avenue Energy Opportunities Fund L.P. will buy positions in distressed and stressed companies in the North American energy and utilities sectors, according to a Reuters report citing an unnamed source. 
The new fund is one of several to be formed following the severe decline in energy prices over the past year, according to a Reuters report. Many investors believe the securities of otherwise strong companies have been caught in the downdraft, presenting an opportunity for nimble and well-capitalized investors. 
Meanwhile, Avenue will close its $500 million hedge fund Avenue International, which launched in July 1997 and has returned an average net 7.35 percent per year but lost 0.42 percent in 2014. 
New York-based Avenue manages approximately $13 billion, of which $2 billion is in funds considered to be liquid and the remainder subject to portfolio lockups that can be as long as five years.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

Avenue is one of a handful of hedge funds that have seized on the sharp drop in oil prices to start new portfolios, convinced that there are strong companies that have been oversold. The Avenue Energy Opportunities Fund L.P. plans to invest in distressed and stressed companies in the energy and utilities sector in North America, the source said.  At the same time, the firm - run by brother and sister team Marc Lasry and Sonia Gardner - plans to shut down a $500 million hedge fund portfolio, Avenue International, where investors can withdraw their money on a quarterly basis. The fund, launched in July 1997, makes up less than 5 percent of the firm's total assets. It has returned an average net 7.35 percent per year but lost 0.42 percent in 2014. Avenue has roughly $2 billion in very liquid funds, including mutual funds, and roughly $11 billion in portfolios that are locked up as long as five years. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.

                Marc Lasry Calls Energy Debt 'Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity'

                    Marc Lasry, chief executive officer of distressed investing specialist Avenue Capital Group, said energy debt offers a "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" after plunges in oil and other commodity prices left many companies overleveraged.
Speaking at the recent Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in New York, Lasry said the amount of distressed debt in energy had grown this year to between roughly $250 billion and $300 billion from $100 billion.
He said that offers opportunities for patient investors not bent on making a quick buck.
"Energy today is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," said Lasry. "Either you will get paid off, or you will become the new equity of these companies, but you need the luxury of time. You need to be able to wait two or three or four years."
Lasry oversees $13.2 billion at New York-based Avenue. He also became co-owner of the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks last year.
Avenue is among a handful of firms that have raised money in recent months for a dedicated energy fund.
Lasry closed the Avenue Energy Opportunities Fund LP in July after raising $1.3 billion, only to see the market become more distressed. Senior secured debt that was once available for 75 cents on the dollar now fetches 40 cents to 50 cents, he said.
"The whole market is oversold, and we're trying to take advantage," Lasry said.
He said the new fund has been investing 5 percent to 10 percent of its assets each month, biding its time as prices across the sector move further downward.
Lasry acknowledged that the fund lost money in its first few months but added that it has investor money locked up for roughly seven years so there is no hurry to sell.
For other investment firms, primarily mutual funds that must return investor capital on demand and hedge funds that promise to return it more quickly, recent heavy losses have become a problem, forcing some investors to resort to hasty selling at inopportune times, Lasry said.
The oil slump will hurt exploration and production companies, he said, but prices "will always come back. The question is, does it take six months or does it take three years?"
Lasry said Avenue was also raising money for a new fund that will invest in Europe with a focus on banks in Great Britain, Germany, Switzerland and Nordic countries.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

VanEck Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF
















Fund Description
VanEck Vectors® Global Alternative Energy ETF (GEX®) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Ardour Global IndexSM Extra Liquid (AGIXLT), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in the business of alternative energy. Alternative energy includes power derived principally from bio-fuels (such as ethanol), bio mass, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal sources, and also includes various technologies that support the production, use and storage of these sources.

Returns reflect temporary contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the ETF incurred all expenses and fees, investment returns would have been reduced. Investment returns and ETF share values will fluctuate so that investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV.The "Net Asset Value" (NAV) of a VanEck Vectors Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF 's intraday trading value. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
