M.S. Electrical Engineering – 1989 
Citation
At Time of Nomination in 2009
Blake W. Augsburger is the President and CEO of the Harman Professional Group and the President of Harman 
				International Industries, Inc. in North America. Harman International is a Fortune 500 company that designs and 
				manufactures branded audio and infotainment products and systems for the automotive, consumer, and professional 
				customer. He manages business units in North America, Canada, Mexico, UK, Switzerland, and Austria.
Blake was born in Beaumont, Texas. He attended Westfield High School in Houston and came to Texas Tech in 1982 
				because several friends were attending. Majoring in mechanical engineering, then business, he worked in a refinery 
				for Tenneco Oil the summer following his freshman year and enjoyed the technical aspects of the opportunity. The 
				experiences at Tenneco encouraged him to return to engineering and choose electrical engineering during his 
				sophomore year.
Taking a job in the laboratory of the Center for Pulsed Power and Power Electronics, he began to learn and 
				understand the applications. For Blake, electrical engineering was more than challenging, but he enjoyed the 
				learning process. While working in the laboratory he met many of his life–long friends and school partners 
				that helped him through the degree program like Brett Smith, Randy Copper, and Richard Ness. Blake stayed at Texas 
				Tech after completing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1987, studying pulsed power under Dr. 
				Kristiansen, and earning a Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1989.
The thesis for his master’s degree was entitled "The Design of a High Power Electron Beam Generator.
				" The project involved the assembly of a 1MV Marx Generator to drive a virtual cathode oscillator developed by 
				then–Ph.D. candidate Steve Calico. The principles learned for the project in electric fields and pulsed power 
				are applicable to his current business and in sound acoustics. His experience in grounding and shielding for his 
				thesis has also proven to be very useful in understanding the installation of sound systems for live music and large 
				installed venues such as sports stadiums.
Following the completion of his master’s degree, Blake worked at Maxwell Laboratories and Hubbell. He 
				worked as a design engineer for a short time and moved quickly into program management and then onto executive 
				management. He was vice president and general manager of High Voltage Test Business, a division of Hubbell Inc., an 
				international manufacturer of electrical and electronic components for industrial, commercial, and utility 
				industries. Blake worked for Hubbell from 1994 until 2001. During this time, he served in several capacities, 
				including the business unit vice president of Hipotronics.
From 2001–2006, Blake was the president and CEO of Crown International, a division of the Harman 
				Professional Group, specializing in audio amplifiers. At Harmon, his engineering background plays a key role in 
				product and technology positioning.
Blake is married to Laura, they have three children; Philip, Daniel, and Maddie. The Augsburgers live in 
				Mishawaka, Indiana.
It is a privilege and a pleasure for Texas Tech University’s Edward E. Whitacre Jr. College of Engineering 
				to select this outstanding alumnus for honor and recognition. Blake W. Augsburger is declared a 
				DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER.

Q&A: Harman Professional CEO Blake Augsburger
Augsburger talks DriveCore chip, Ethernet, CEDIA Expo, and more.

Harman’s DriveCore chip, which is dwarfed by conventional circuit boards and was co-developed with TI exclusively for Harman, is included in several of the Harman brands’ new Class D amplifiers. Harman CEO Blake Augsburger (pictured) says its benefits include energy efficiency and weight reduction.




Tom LeBlanc


 · September 30, 2010

Blake Augsburger has a lot on his plate. The CEO of Harman Professional and performance A/V group (HPAV) and head of Harman International in North America is dealing with what the company views as a paradigm shift in the way home and commercial systems will be networked.
Harman is a member of AVnu Alliance, an organization that promotes IEEE 802.1 Audio Video Bridging (AVB) for the interoperability of networked audio/video in homes, commercial environments and automobiles - three areas for which the company makes a lot of products.
Ultimately, Augsburger says that traditional automation and multiroom networking systems are too complicated - for both end users and installers - to have longevity. He says Harman is working on networking solutions that are easier to install, easier to use and easier on the wallet, and expects them to start trickling onto the market not long after CEDIA Expo 2010.
CEDIA Expo is a big one for Harman and its brands - Crown, JBL, Lexicon, Mark Levinson, Revel, to name a few. Not only does it want to get the word out about its upcoming Ethernet-based networking products, but it also wants to talk about its minuscule Class D amplifier chip technology, co-developed with TI exclusively for Harman, that it says makes amps far more energy efficient, lighter and easier to install. It’s also high on its Quantum Logic technology which it says will solve one of the custom electronics industry’s biggest dilemmas: the public’s almost universal embrace of compressed audio files.
Augsburger recently spoke to CE Pro about all that Harman has in the works.
What impact will IEEE 802.1 AVB have on residential integration?
We’ve invested heavily over the past 10 years in networking components. For us, it was out of necessity because when you do a large stadium, for example, you have equipment rooms spread out and it’s a challenge to control all these components and monitor all the pieces remotely.
That drove us to put together the SDIG (Systems Development Integration Group) about eight years ago and we started really focusing on control and monitoring; we were moving data around with Cobranet. Then about two years ago we got very involved in this [AVnu Alliance]. Up to that point we were able to move data over an Ethernet cable; we knew it was going to get there but we didn’t know the time it was going to get there; you’d have all sorts of jitter problems.
What Ethernet AVB did for us was it solved that jitter problem and then it also allowed us to increase the bandwidth so we could move audio and video. So that’s really how we’ve developed the pro side of the business. What we want to do is take that technology and integrate it into this CEDIA type business. We see a lot of opportunity in the residential side and the office side.
I think we have the expertise from our professional side and it’s all about creating a value solution. It’s got to be easy to use. Nowadays when you look at a professional system, you’ve got engineers that work with contractors that have to do the programming and set it up. We need to get over that hump. So we’re trying to deal with that with Ethernet AVB wall panels so you can control the stuff and it’s an easy to use interface.
What does it mean for installers?
The key for us, and I think the key for this business in general, is that we have to simplify the installation. Today, to do a Crestron or AMX system, you have to be trained and constantly stay up on the training. How do we simplify that whole process?
Our goal at the end of the day is to make it easy to use, plug and play. That would mean guys [integrators] can lower their costs. If you look at a contractor today on the professional side, if he’s going to put in a system he’s got to have somebody on his staff who’s an expert at every component. It’s the same thing for a residential installer. If he’s going to put a system in, he’s got to have somebody on his staff who knows everything.
If Harman can bring a whole system solution and you have one guy on your staff that understands the whole thing and it all plugs and plays, it saves them money.
The key takeaway point there is: How do we make it easier to use and easier to install?
How do you see IEEE 802.1 AVB fitting in the market versus other existing cable networking solutions? 
We’re Ethernet guys. That’s where we see the future and that’s where we’re investing all of our money.

Parasher in, Augsburger out at Harman Professional Solutions

Dave Robinson
17 May 2016


Harman has named Mohit Parasher, 47, as executive VP and president for the Professional Solutions division, effective immediately. The appointment sees the exit of Blake Augsburger, who has led this part of the technology company (formerly the Professional division, restructured in the last six months to form Professional Solutions) since 2007.
The change follows Harman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal’s earnings call to investors at the end of April, when he said he was “not satisfied” with certain aspects of the business’ growth, and that “decisive steps” had been taken to improve the cost structure.
Parasher (pictured) was previously VP and general manager for Harman’s Consumer Audio and Professional Solutions businesses in Asia Pacific.
“Mohit has consistently demonstrated outstanding leadership and success in general management, sales, marketing and channel management, achieving rapid growth for Harman’s audio brands and Professional Solutions in Asia Pacific,” said CEO Dinesh Paliwal last week. “In addition to his impressive record at Harman, Mohit has more than 20 years of global experience growing audio, video and systems businesses throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A proven transformation architect in the retail and business-to-business segments, Mohit has the ideal background to evolve our Professional Solutions division to a holistic solutions-based organisation and capitalise on the tremendous growth opportunities before us.”
Parasher steps directly into Augsburger’s old role, and is now responsible for all worldwide operations, strategy and performance of the Professional Solutions division, the “world’s largest professional audio, lighting, video and control products and systems organisation”, encompassing brands such as JBL, AKG, Soundcraft and Studer, and recent acquisitions such as AMX and Martin Professional.
“Blake has been extremely influential in the evolution of the Harman Professional portfolio, most recently leading the extension of our capabilities beyond audio and into lighting and enterprise solutions,” continued Paliwal. “We are grateful for his many contributions to the success of the company and wish him well in his future endeavours.”
The probability of the change to senior management was signposted in Harman’s Q3 (January-March 2016) earnings call to financial investors at NASDAQ. In the call on 28 April (as transcribed by SeekingAlpha.com), Paliwal revealed that, despite an overall improvement in the company’s performance, and sales of $6.7bn for the 12 months ending 31 March, results across the divisions were “mixed”.
“We continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions,” Paliwal said, reporting that the “Brazil[ian] and certain European markets continued to be soft”.
He said the transition of the business from product-based (Harman Professional) to solutions-based (Harman Professional Solutions) was “absolutely… the right structure”.
“We have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through.
“However, it is a complex change and it takes time. I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry, our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, video switching and enterprise automation.”
But, he noted, he was “not satisfied with this performance or the timeline”.
“We have already taken decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We are confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability.”
Parasher has been with Harman for two years, and held previous senior roles with telecommunications giant Bharti Airtel and Sony Europe.

“Mohit has consistently demonstrated outstanding leadership and success in general management, sales, marketing and channel management, achieving rapid growth for Harman’s audio brands and Professional Solutions in Asia Pacific,” said CEO Dinesh Paliwal last week. “In addition to his impressive record at Harman, Mohit has more than 20 years of global experience growing audio, video and systems businesses throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. A proven transformation architect in the retail and business-to-business segments, Mohit has the ideal background to evolve our Professional Solutions division to a holistic solutions-based organisation and capitalise on the tremendous growth opportunities before us.”
Parasher steps directly into Augsburger’s old role, and is now responsible for all worldwide operations, strategy and performance of the Professional Solutions division, the “world’s largest professional audio, lighting, video and control products and systems organisation”, encompassing brands such as JBL, AKG, Soundcraft and Studer, and recent acquisitions such as AMX and Martin Professional.
“Blake has been extremely influential in the evolution of the Harman Professional portfolio, most recently leading the extension of our capabilities beyond audio and into lighting and enterprise solutions,” continued Paliwal. “We are grateful for his many contributions to the success of the company and wish him well in his future endeavours.”
The probability of the change to senior management was signposted in Harman’s Q3 (January-March 2016) earnings call to financial investors at NASDAQ. In the call on 28 April (as transcribed by SeekingAlpha.com), Paliwal revealed that, despite an overall improvement in the company’s performance, and sales of $6.7bn for the 12 months ending 31 March, results across the divisions were “mixed”.
“We continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions,” Paliwal said, reporting that the “Brazil[ian] and certain European markets continued to be soft”.
He said the transition of the business from product-based (Harman Professional) to solutions-based (Harman Professional Solutions) was “absolutely… the right structure”.
“We have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through.
“However, it is a complex change and it takes time. I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry, our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, video switching and enterprise automation.”
But, he noted, he was “not satisfied with this performance or the timeline”.
“We have already taken decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We are confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability.”
Parasher has been with Harman for two years, and held previous senior roles with telecommunications giant Bharti Airtel and Sony Europe.
