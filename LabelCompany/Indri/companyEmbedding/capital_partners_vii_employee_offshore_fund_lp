			FINANCIAL PLANNING		






Before we even begin to develop a plan we always begin with a discovery process of what your exact financial goal is. After all, how can you arrive at your destination if you don’t even know where you’re headed? Unlike traditional models, we don’t cram you into a category based on age, asset level, annual income, or an arbitrary risk tolerance that a computer program determined for you. We choose to take a more holistic approach that takes into account the economy around you as well as your individual feeling toward risk and volatility. After all, you are not simply a number and shouldn’t be treated as such.
As a part of the financial planning process we will discover which of the following areas deserves the most attention:



Commitment to Savings
College Savings


Income Planning
Debt Management


Tax Planning
Risk Management


Efficient utilization of Assets
Retirement Planning


Proper Diversification
Small Business Ownership


Insurance Analysis
Estate and Succession Planning



Once we identify your goals and develop a plan to achieve your objectives, we’ll implement the overall strategy with, but not limited to the following investment options at our disposal:



Stocks
Life Insurance


ETF’s
Venture Capital Investments


Trusts
Mutual Funds


Real Estate
401(k)


Bonds
Limited Partnerships


Traditional and Roth IRA’s
Alternative Assets









We are a fiduciary, fee only registered investment advisor that is not compensated by commissions charged to our clients. We make sure that we work for you and not Wall Street.

Managing Partner’s Message












In a rapidly changing world, we all need robust financial guidance and management more than ever in order to properly navigate an often confusing and volatile investment landscape. We believe that while the markets and technology seem to morph into something new on a daily basis, the fundamental principles that build a proper foundation for investing do not. Hence our motto: “Traditional Values, for a New Financial World.”
The last thirteen years have been an enormously difficult and trying stretch of time for this country and everyone in it. Starting with the dot-com bust that began in March of 2000, a seemingly endless barrage of events soon followed that continues to test our resolve to this day. In the wake of 9/11, the housing market collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the credit crisis, the European debt crisis, and the threat of further terrorist attacks, investor anxiety has hit an all time high and deservedly so. However, in the face of such adversity we can all still choose to take control of our lives, stop living in fear of an uncertain future, and move forward with the confidence and belief that any realistic financial goal can be reached.
My personal pledge is to ensure that every single thing we do as a company is geared toward helping our clients achieve their unique financial objectives. Period.
In a world that largely pays lip-service to such a principle, we remain committed to this sentiment as the bedrock of how we conduct our business. At VII Capital you are our first priority and you always will be.











Sincerely,















Peter C. Kyriakoulis
Founder and Managing Partner








Company Mission












The VII Capital Group’s mission is to provide our clients with an unparalleled level of service and performance that cannot be found at a traditional Wall Street firm. We accomplish this by adhering to a strict code of ethics, by implementing proprietary risk management techniques, by following a systematic disciplined investment process, and by ensuring that our fee structure never separates our interests from those of our clients.

NEW YORK, April 21, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexington Partners ("Lexington"), the largest independent manager of secondary acquisition funds, today announced the final close of Lexington Capital Partners VIII, L.P. and associated vehicles ("LCP VIII") at $10.1 billion.  The fund, which commenced investing in 2014, accepted commitments up to its hard cap and is the largest dedicated secondary acquisition fund ever raised, significantly exceeding Lexington's prior secondary fund, LCP VII, which closed on $7.1 billion in 2011.  Lexington has also established an innovative $1.75 billion credit facility which provides LCP VIII additional transaction flexibility.
LCP VIII will acquire global private equity and alternative assets through a full range of negotiated secondary market transactions including: portfolio acquisitions, balance sheet spin-outs, equity co-investments, hedge fund private equity purchases, and fund recapitalizations.  LCP VIII also has the ability to invest in new private investment funds. 
LCP VIII has been formed with commitments from over 300 investors, concentrated among major public pensions, corporate pensions, and sovereign wealth funds in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and the Middle East.  Insurance companies, endowments, foundations, family offices, and high net worth investors also subscribed, with existing investors contributing a majority of the fund's capital.
Commenting on the fund closing, Brent Nicklas, Managing Partner of Lexington, said, "We are grateful for the strong support of our existing and new investors who have chosen to commit significant capital to LCP VIII.  Our high-quality global investor base and the substantial capital they have entrusted to Lexington will enhance the fund's secondary capabilities with global counterparties and sponsors."
Lexington has committed approximately 30% of LCP VIII's capital, investing in six transactions with banks and financial institutions, five transactions with fiduciaries, one hedge fund transaction, and a fund restructuring.  The majority of LCP VIII's committed transactions have been sourced exclusively by Lexington.
Secondary industry volume in 2014 was the highest on record with over $35 billion of completed transactions, a level that is expected to be surpassed in 2015 with projected volume of $40 billion or more.  The pipeline of transactions stemming from regulatory-driven selling by banks and financial institutions, more active management of alternative investment allocations by fiduciaries, and GP-led fund restructurings, suggest that the secondary market will continue to grow significantly in the years ahead.
"Today's secondary market is increasingly characterized by transaction diversity, complexity, and scale.  Over a long period of time, Lexington has developed the proven execution experience, counterparty reputation, breadth of sponsor relationships, and strength of capital to provide differentiated and innovative solutions to investors seeking to rebalance their alternative investment portfolios.  With the successful capitalization of LCP VIII, we look forward to continuing our leadership of the global secondary market," said Mr. Nicklas.
About Lexington PartnersLexington Partners is a leading global alternative investment manager primarily involved in providing liquidity solutions to owners of private equity and other alternative investments and in making co-investments alongside leading private equity sponsors.  Lexington Partners is the largest independent manager of secondary acquisition and co-investment funds with more than $33 billion in committed capital.  Lexington has acquired over 2,400 secondary and co-investment interests through 550 transactions with a total value in excess of $35 billion, including $11 billion of syndications.  Lexington also invests in private investment funds during their initial formation and has committed to more than 280 new funds in the U.S., Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.  Lexington has offices strategically located in major centers for private equity and alternative investing – New York, Boston, Menlo Park, London, and Hong Kong.  Lexington also has senior advisors located in Asia, Australia, and Latin America.  Additional information may be found at www.lexingtonpartners.com.
