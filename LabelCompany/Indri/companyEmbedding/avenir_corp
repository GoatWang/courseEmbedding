Welcome




 About AvenirAVENIR IS A VALUE ORIENTED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM LOCATED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.The firm was founded in 1980 and functioned primarily as a family office until the late 1980’s, at which point we began accepting new accounts. Today Avenir manages over $1 billion in separate accounts for individuals, families and institutions, including limited partnerships, foundations, pensions and endowments. Avenir is owned by its principal managers who combined have over five decades of investment management experience through numerous market cycles.Our MissionAvenir’s mission is to preserve and enhance the purchasing power of the capital entrusted to our care.Our PhilosophyAvenir’s investment philosophy is best characterized as “discount-to-intrinsic value” investing and centers on an ability to determine a company’s true net worth, which we establish by evaluating the long-term free cash flows generated by the business. We then assess a management team’s ability to compound intrinsic value on a per share basis over time.Our philosophy is derived from the work of Benjamin Graham, as further refined by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, among others, and is based upon the premise that no one can consistently predict the direction of the stock market or interest rates, which leads us to focus solely on a “bottom-up” analysis of an investment opportunity.We are patient, long-term investors and seek to earn an attractive return with a margin of safety. Further, we go wherever we see value and are not limited by market capitalization or country of domicile. Avenir portfolios are generally concentrated and are managed for total return over a long period of time.

Applying Our Philosophy — Avenir Corporation

















































Applying Our Philosophy




 Applying Our PhilosophyWe seek out companies that possess three characteristics:a lasting franchise; honest, shareholder-oriented management with excellent capital allocation skills; and a bargain valuationCompanies fitting this description are typically fairly valued in the marketplace.  While financial markets are usually efficient, they will from time to time present opportunities to buy good businesses at bargain prices.We do our own research, performing in-depth fundamental analysis of any company that attracts our attention. We avoid the concept of relative valuation and do not believe that a stock is cheap simply because it is selling at lower multiples than its peers. Furthermore, if we are earning an attractive internal return on our investment, then we will continue to hold that investment until a more attractive opportunity arises.We avoid being influenced by short-term volatility, except to take advantage of an opportunity to sell a stock if it becomes overvalued or buy more if it becomes undervalued. The speed at which a company’s business success will be recognized by the market is difficult to estimate. Therefore, we do not attempt to time the market and often invest contrary to conventional wisdom. If we are right in our analysis, a company’s value will be realized over the long term.Our portfolios are relatively concentrated, reflecting a high level of conviction based on our understanding of the businesses we own and the margin of safety incorporated in our analysis.  Alignment of InterestsAvenir’s client relationships are based on trust and are best characterized as partnerships. Our own investments mirror those of our clients.In short, “we eat our own cooking.”
