Liberty Oilfield Services provides expertise regarding fracture growth behavior and its impact on production performance, acquired through a pursuit of real-data analysis and decades of experience with calibrated fracture growth and reservoir modeling.
Liberty’s frac designs focus on how we can help our customers make better wells for less.  We consider many factors such as rock mechanics, wellbore design, fluid dynamics and chemistry, past observations of fracture growth behavior from fracture mapping and net pressure history matching, production response in neighboring wells, and the overall requirements for the reservoir for the desired proppant conductivity and placement.
Liberty Oilfield Services can help you to:


Evaluate completion and production trends in a specific area using one of our extensive databases for US liquid-rich basins in conjunction with detailed multi-variate analysis.  This provides a useful “big picture” starting point for any frac design. 


Review past frac experience to determine critical design issues, problem areas, additional data requirements, and develop a frac design generating a reduction in $/BOE.


Assist in the coordination and evaluation of laboratory and field tests required to support the stimulation program.


Perform analysis of diagnostic data (DFIT’s, mini-frac and other injections) to obtain basic analysis anchor points and to help estimate achieved fracture dimensions.


Conduct fracture model calibration that ties in directly measured fracture dimensions with net pressure history matching, to provide a fracture design tool that is tied to real measurements.


Perform production data analysis and reservoir modeling. Evaluate and reconcile well production response and evaluate production sensitivities to frac design and wellbore placement changes.






At Liberty we live to frac, and frac efficiently.  To ensure efficient operations and maximization of pump time versus downtime, Liberty is on the forefront of operational and equipment innovation.  We have a strong focus on safely improving efficiencies through our more experienced personnel and redundancies in backup equipment.
While our frac design expertise helps making you better wells, Liberty Oilfield Services superior service quality helps to bring your well on production faster.
WITH LIBERTY ON THE JOB, YOU GET:

Experienced and trained oilfield personnel deliver predictable well performance and who are happy to be on your location.  We are an employer of choice, providing us with more experienced employees, higher service quality and a better safety track record.
High quality and state of the art equipment, including:
	
​Warehouse trailer and other redundancies that help reduce downtime
Dual fuel HHP units that reduce fuel
Iron trailer designed by frac crews, providing significant improvements in rig-up and rig-down times


Trend-setting technologies, including:
	
​Boxed proppant solution – PropX, which helps reduce dust, noise and truck traffic
Liberty’s unique proppant quality assessment, providing an estimate of conductivity against proppant vendor data on all types of proppant pumped in a well, as well as live mesh distribution check on all
Liberty Quiet Fleet, which are designed for urban areas to dramatically reduce noise

Liberty-tested Vorteq missile, which significantly reduces wear and tear on fluid and is projected to be commercial in 2018
Liberty SonicStrap, providing continuous and more accurate strapping to lower chemical variances for all








Liberty is providing a new technical perspective to unconventional completions. We have helped our customers to improve production using our unique insights in fracture growth behavior in unconventional resource plays through our extensive fracture mapping and fracture analysis experience.
In ultra-low permeability shale gas reservoirs like the Barnett Shale low-viscosity slickwater treatments encouraged complex fracture growth, the key to economic shale development. In liquid-rich formations we are not always so lucky. Creating fracture complexity is not always easy and often driven by the nature of the completion. In addition, the higher-permeability unconventional plays often require sufficient conductivity as well as fracture complexity. 
Liberty recognizes there are no silver bullets to maximize production in any particular unconventional play. We let the data speak to us to come up with the best design for every play. Liberty can provide you with the following “big picture” completion data evaluation tools:


Liberty Frac Trends

Liberty continuously mines and double-checks completion and production data available in the public domain, and brings this all together in a versatile data viewer that allows for super-flexible filtering and cross-plotting to help understand completion trends and their impact on production. We publish these basin frac trends for every liquid-rich basin in the US in an online viewer. Request Access to Liberty Frac Trends.





Liberty Fraconomics

Liberty conducts multi-variate analysis (MVA) to evaluate the true impact of completion changes. Where Liberty Frac Trends provides simple bi-variate analysis comparisons, the true impact of completion parameters on production can only be revealed through statistical analysis. We publish these basin Fraconomics for every liquid-rich basin in the US on a regular basis and can customize this analysis for your requested area of interest. Request Your Fraconomics Analysis.

PERFORMANCE













TECHNICAL EXPERTISE













MANAGEMENT



















WHAT WE DO
Liberty Resources II, LLC (dba Liberty Resources LLC) is a Denver-based oil and gas Company focused on acquiring acreage in emerging oil and gas resource plays and generating superior production results based on applying our completions expertise to maximize production and economic recovery. The principals in Liberty are recognized as global experts in hydraulic fracturing and other technologies, and the Liberty team has consistently generated the highest production rates per well achieved by the industry in the areas in which they operate.
Prior to the formation of Liberty Resources II, LLC the management team in 2010 founded Liberty Resources LL ("Liberty I") with the principal financial support of Riverstone Holdings LLC, an energy and power-focused private equity investment firm with approximately $30 billion of equity capital raised. In Liberty I, the company acquired approximately 43,000 net acres in the Bakken formation of Williams and McKenzie counties in North Dakota through transacting thirteen separate land acquisitions. The company drilled 31 operated wells and grew production to approximately 6,000 BOE/day. During its operation of the Bakken assets, Liberty’s unique completion design was pumped on a total of 86 operated and partner wells and resulted in the highest production rates per well among operators in the Bakken formation. Liberty I sold its initial North Dakota production and acreage to a larger public company in July 2013 for $680 Million.

Liberty Resources II, LLC ("Liberty II") was founded in late 2013 also with the principal support of Riverstone Holdings LLC in order to transact on the acquisition of ~53,000 net acres in the Williston Basin. The company's development plan consists of two-rig multi-year drilling program of ~150 wells in the core of its properties near Tioga, ND. Drilling started in 2014 and despite the current low commodity prices the company continues to run one drilling rig on these properties and has grown operated gross production to ~6,000 BOE/day.
In 2015 Liberty II purchased approximately 15,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and has submitted drilling permits to start development drilling there in 2016.

Liberty Oilfield Services, a privately-held pressure pumping company, has completed the previously announced acquisition of Sanjel Corp.’s US assets.  With the closing of the transaction, Liberty has doubled its hydraulic fracturing capacity to almost 500,000 hhp, and has expanded its operating presence to cover the Permian and Eagle Ford basins in addition to its current operations in the Williston, Powder River and DJ basins. To maintain a focus on hydraulic fracturing technology and services, Liberty has entered into subsequent arrangements with O-Tex Pumping for control and operation of the cementing assets and Patriot Well Solutions for control and operation of the coiled tubing assets.
Liberty's investors' equity funded the Sanjel purchase and committed nearly $100M of additional equity for future growth opportunities.
Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP represented Liberty Oilfield Services, a portfolio company of Riverstone Holdings LLC.

Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. Key Developments

Liberty Oilfield Services Announce the Release of its New Quiet Fleet™
Aug 16 16
Liberty Oilfield Services announced the release of its new Quiet Fleet™. The Quiet Fleet™ utilizes Liberty-developed sound reduction technology incorporated directly into fracturing equipment to dramatically reduce noise emissions during hydraulic fracturing operations. Noise levels are reduced by a factor of 3 compared to a conventional fracturing fleet, far more effective than costly sound walls. This noise reduction is achieved without any impact to operational performance or rig up time. The new design of the Quiet Fleet™ also allowed the incorporation of a sophisticated three stage fire suppression system on each unit, which is not viable on a conventional fracturing fleet.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
