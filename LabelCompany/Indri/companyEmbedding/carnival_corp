Carnival Corporation Launches New Brand, fathom; Creates New Social Impact Travel Category
 


 
































 




 





 


WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, N.Y., June 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE:   CUK), the world's largest travel and leisure company, today launched a new brand called fathom™, defining a new travel category it is calling "social impact travel," that will offer consumers authentic, meaningful impact travel experiences to work alongside locals as they tackle community needs. What sets fathom apart is the long-term, systematic partnership approach with its partner countries paired with the unique business model that allows for sustained impact and lasting development. fathom's scale and global vision reach beyond what the world has ever seen.  
The company's first destination will be the Dominican Republic, a country known for its spectacular beauty but also a country where the average household income is approximately $6,000 USD a year and more than two million Dominicans do not have access to piped water.
fathom will operate as a standalone brand, the 10th global brand in the Carnival Corporation family. 
Beginning in April 2016, fathom will embark on seven-day voyages from PortMiami aboard the MV Adonia, a 710-passenger vessel redeployed from Carnival Corporation's P&O Cruises (UK) for the start-up of the new operation. Depending on their passions, interests and skills, travelers will have the opportunity to choose from a range of social impact activities and experiences both onboard and onshore. 
Travel That Creates Enduring, Transformative Social Impact 
"fathom will cater to a growing market of consumers who want to have a positive impact on people's lives, and aren't always sure where to begin," said Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation. "We believe travel is a meaningful way to allow for personal growth while making purposeful and engaging contributions to the world. We are so pleased that fathom will give travelers a unique opportunity to work alongside local people as part of a larger scale effort that will demonstrably improve lives. Both our travelers and the local citizens will learn and benefit from the opportunity to serve together."
Donald brought in a non-traditional, social entrepreneur, Tara Russell, Founder and Chairman of Create Common Good (www.createcommongood.org), a food production social enterprise, to lead this effort. Russell will serve as President of fathom and as Global Impact Lead for Carnival Corporation. Russell established and led the team that has been working on the design and business model for fathom since late 2013.
"We created fathom to meet the real hunger in the world for purpose, while at the same time tackling profound social issues through a sustainable business model," said Russell. "We harness the assets and resources of the world's largest travel and leisure company and combine them with the talents and hearts of those working in social enterprises around the world.
"Travelers will work in partnership with proven, trusted local organizations on the ground to amplify their missions for far greater, sustained impact," Russell said. "Because fathom will bring hundreds of travelers to a destination on a regular basis, fathom can achieve focused and holistic, collaborative contributions in a broad region of the country – allowing fathom travelers to make a collective, transformative impact that they know will extend far beyond their involvement. They also will know they played an important role in ensuring the region flourishes. We are excited about making the Puerto Plata region of the Dominican Republic our first partner destination, and we are optimistic about taking all that is being built in and through fathom to other global destinations and to the broader Carnival corporate family."
According to Russell, the fathom team took an innovative design-thinking approach to deeply understanding both its travelers, as well as the needs identified by stakeholders across all parts of society in the Dominican Republic, and will continue to leverage the unique approach.  
"fathom will mobilize, educate and equip up to 700 travelers on every trip allowing for thousands of impact activity days per week – and tens of thousands of travelers a year to communities of promise, providing unprecedented scale for impact," said Russell. "fathom has been built differently, having worked carefully to ensure any and all efforts fathom travelers engage with are authentically impactful, scalable and sustainable. fathom's scale allows the opportunity to continuously innovate in the social impact space, while achieving holistic, transformational societal contributions that will help a broad region flourish."
Based on extensive market research, fathom has identified a sizable and growing market of potential social impact travel consumers – approximately one million North Americans who are strongly predisposed, in addition to global travelers already pursuing service-oriented travel experiences worldwide – who will be interested in this type of travel offering. 
In addition, the company believes fathom will attract a significant number of travelers who have never before cruised. According to research, nearly 40 percent of the individuals who will book a social impact trip on fathom might otherwise never have chosen to cruise.
According to Russell, fathom will attract people of all ages and from all walks of life, but especially North American, U.K. and Australian citizens ages 20 to 60 years old who are eager to discover their individual gifts, and unleash their personal passions and talents to improve the world. The company expects to be particularly popular among:

Millennials – people in their 20s and 30s looking to make a difference in the world; 
Parents seeking a way to open their children's eyes to other parts of the world in a meaningful way (approximately half of travelers are expected to be families); and 
Adults 50+ years of age eager to find rewarding ways to help other people apart from writing a check.
"During the past 10 years, in countless conversations I have had with people eager to serve others and make meaningful societal contributions, there has been a common theme – people struggle to know where they fit in and often people have challenges finding trusted, easy ways to make a difference," said Russell. "fathom exists to address this desire and to create enduring, life-changing impact, both in the communities where fathom operates, and in the lives of the travelers who embark on one of our journeys, allowing for unique impact experiences before, during and after the trip."
Dominican Republic identified as fathom's first social impact partner destination
The new brand selected the Puerto Plata region of the Dominican Republic as its first impact destination based on a number of factors: genuine needs, infrastructure to support social initiatives, enthusiasm for the fathom concept by locals at all layers of society including country officials, its location (proximity to Miami and Amber Cove, the new Dominican destination being launched by Carnival Corporation in October 2015), its innate beauty. The fathom team worked closely with local Dominicans, resident Dominican business and educational leaders, Dominican government officials and leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country to fully understand the societal needs and determine the best way for fathom to participate in addressing those needs. 
fathom has initially identified two lead impact partners in the Dominican Republic – Entrena and the Instituto Dominicano de Desarrollo Integral, Inc. (IDDI). Both organizations have deep roots in the country, including long-established programs and strong social connections in the northern Dominican region. fathom travelers will work alongside these organizations across the northern region to help Entrena and IDDI programs achieve much greater impact. Because fathom will regularly transport hundreds of travelers to the country, the support will be significant and sustainable – fathom travelers will make long-lasting contributions to the community.
A portion of every ticket purchase price will go directly to fathom partner organizations to cover on-the-ground activities in the Dominican Republic, including supplies, travel, personnel to assist with the activities and funding to support the partner organizations' overall missions. This sustained partnership between fathom and its impact partners allows these organizations to have predictable revenue streams to even further amplify their missions.   
"Having led the Dominican based non-profit IDDI, for more than 31 years, I have worked with a very large number of corporations ranging from energy, sugar, chocolate and cigar producers, as well as tourism and free-trade zone companies," said David Luther, founder and executive director of IDDI, a non-profit organization with the mission to help alleviate poverty in rural and urban areas of the Dominican Republic. "I have always insisted on a horizontal relationship based on a win-win partnership, but on many occasions it has taken a great deal of convincing on our part for these to understand the benefits to the private sector of improving the overall well-being of Dominican society.
"fathom and Carnival Corporation are without a doubt the exception. They are making a strategic bet on contributing to the development of the Dominican Republic incorporating this initiative into their business plan, which is to me a remarkable step for a corporation of their size. This is not just Corporate Social Responsibility, but a vision of bringing people together as a catalyst for change, be they passengers on a ship or members of low-income communities – very, very innovative. In this, fathom and Carnival Corporation are demonstrating they are willing and capable of creating experiences that transform lives."
"Entrena is excited about and committed to the fathom concept of impact travel for the north coast of the Dominican Republic," said John Seibel, founder and president, Entrena, an organization specializing in training, education, and social enterprise. "We believe this concept will enhance sustainable development efforts to foster widespread prosperity among these Dominican communities by improving lives, creating hope for the future, and providing profound and meaningful experiences for fathom and for all Carnival Corporation passengers."
fathom experience focuses on education, environment and economic development
The fathom journey is a carefully designed, holistic impact journey and will begin with one to two days at sea preparing hearts and minds for the on-the-ground experience, including a wide variety of fun and engaging impact-readiness experiences, ranging from an orientation to the Dominican Republic, conversational Spanish lessons, impact activity training, creative workshops, personal enrichment and much more.
fathom travelers may build their own schedules and will have the flexibility each day to choose from a variety of social impact and recreational activities. At launch, the company will offer a selection of fun, immersive, and meaningful activities focused on education, the environment, and economic development along with all the incredible experiences the Puerto Plata region innately has to offer. 
Impact activities will vary in length from a few hours to multiple days. Depending on their passions and skills, travelers may spend up to three days on causes they care about, working alongside locals and fathom partner organizations on one or more projects suitable for a wide range of ages, levels of skill and amounts of physical activity. Sample activities may include:

Economic Development:  Help cultivate cacao plants and organic fertilizer at a nursery and assist a local women's cooperative in producing artisan chocolates. This activity is designed to produce high-quality plants to increase farmers' yields through sustainable practices and – importantly – create income opportunities for rural women.  Over time, this activity will allow the cooperative to increase their workforce so the cooperative can achieve economic independence.    
Educational:  Work side by side with Dominican school teachers in classrooms to teach English skills and help boost students' academic performance; and participate in adult-learning programs to teach small groups of local community members conversational English to help improve their ability to qualify for jobs that provide a higher level of income. 
Environmental:  Provide hands-on support to craft and build water filters – using clay, a natural resource found locally – and deliver those filters to families throughout the community to provide healthy drinking water. With limited piped water supply, this will make a meaningful difference in the quality of people's lives throughout the region.
"Together we aim to help communities and travelers flourish by providing immersive, life-changing experiences for travelers and allowing our partner communities to prosper," said Russell.
When not participating in social impact activities, travelers will enjoy exploring the beauty of the region, experiencing the many Dominican beaches and sites of interest, or participating in any one of an array of different recreational activities available to the entire family of Carnival Corporation brands visiting Amber Cove and the Puerto Plata region. 
The onboard experience will be customized to this unique travel market, including specialized, purposeful retail options and amenities, as well as geographically inspired menus, music, and additional onboard cultural immersion. While docked in the Dominican Republic, the fathom ship will serve as a comfortable, convenient home-base for travelers.
Travelers may reserve travel on future fathom voyages
Travelers may reserve a spot on future fathom sailings by calling any travel agent or visiting www.fathom.org or by calling 1-855-9fathom. Prices for the seven-day trip to the Dominican Republic start at $1,540 per person, which includes an exterior cabin with a window, all meals on the ship, onboard social impact immersion experiences, three on-shore social impact activities and related supplies, taxes, fees, and port expenses. Prices will vary by season.
There will be four pricing levels, based on cabin configuration and location – interior cabins, exterior cabins with a window, exterior balcony cabins and suites. Additional recreational activities, cabin upgrades, and dining and beverage packages will be priced separately. Travelers may begin tailoring their trip in fall 2015 (e.g., impact activities selection, cabin selections, etc.).
The future of social impact in Carnival Corporation
In addition to leading the new fathom brand, Russell will work with Carnival Corporation's nine other brands in her role as Global Impact Lead on social impact strategies and opportunities.
"With fathom, we are building one-of-a-kind, collaborative community social impact models and experiences and a solid network of reputable local and global NGO partnerships that, once established, can be considered for replication across global regions and company brands," said Russell. "As fathom grows and evolves, we will continue exploring additional fathom destinations and experiences and identify powerful brand partnerships we can establish, both within the Carnival Corporate family, and also more broadly outside the corporation with other like-minded impact brands. 
"In addition, we will evaluate these unique fathom assets to determine which models can be scaled across other Carnival brands as a way to bring new experiences to existing cruise line guests."

History[edit]
Carnival Corporation & plc was formed in 2003, with the acquisition by Carnival Corporation of P&O Princess Cruises.[7]
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions, and between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.[3]
P&O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O group.[8] Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O operated the world's first commercial passenger ships, the predecessor of modern cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O group in the 20th Century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises,[9] as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.[10]
Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.[11]
It was agreed that P&O Princess Cruises plc would remain as a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company would simply be renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group.[12]
Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007[13] and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.[14]
Current operations[edit]
The Carnival group now comprises 10 cruise line brands [15] operating a combined fleet of over 100 ships, totalling over 190,000 lower berths, and with new ships on order.[16] A 10th brand, stylised as fathom, was announced in June 2015, and commenced operations in April 2016.[17][18] Fathom operations will be discontinued in June 2017.[19] In 2011 the combined brands of the Carnival group controlled a 49.2% share of the total worldwide cruise market.[20] By late 2018, Carnival Corporation will be the first cruise company to use LNG on both the open sea and in port, when the company's first LNG-powered ship enters into service.[21] The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio.

Brands and ships[edit]
AIDA Cruises[edit]
Main article: AIDA Cruises
AIDA Cruises originates from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany in 1952.[22] The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.[22] In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O, with the AIDA being repurchased from NCL. P&O subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.[22] From 2000 to 2003, AIDA Cruises was a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises plc and since the formation of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, it has been under the executive control of Costa Cruises Group, with corporate headquarters in Genoa, Italy and operational headquarters in Rostock, Germany.

Carnival Cruise Line[edit]
Main article: Carnival Cruise Line
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis.[3] Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2.[3] Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital.[3] The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.[3] Carnival continues to be the largest single brand within the Carnival group today, operating twenty six vessels.

Costa Cruises[edit]
Main article: Costa Cruises
Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854.[23] Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953.[23] The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.[23] Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours.[24] Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises is now one of the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.

Cunard Line[edit]
Main article: Cunard Line
The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O Cruises, Cunard Line originates from 1840 and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.[25] After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.[26] The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of the Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties.[27] To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.[28] Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996.[29] In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder.[30] Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.[31] Following the merger of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in 2003, executive control of the Cunard brand was transferred to Carnival UK, with corporate and operational headquarters in Southampton, England.

Holland America Line[edit]
Main article: Holland America Line
Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM).[32] The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including the SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973.[32] Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.[32] Since the formation of Carnival Corporation and plc in 2003, Holland America Line has been one of the principal operating companies of the Carnival Group, with corporate and operational headquarters in Seattle.

History[edit]
Carnival Corporation & plc was formed in 2003, with the acquisition by Carnival Corporation of P&O Princess Cruises.[7]
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions, and between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.[3]
P&O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O group.[8] Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O operated the world's first commercial passenger ships, the predecessor of modern cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O group in the 20th Century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises,[9] as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.[10]
Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.[11]
It was agreed that P&O Princess Cruises plc would remain as a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company would simply be renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group.[12]
Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007[13] and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.[14]
Current operations[edit]
The Carnival group now comprises 10 cruise line brands [15] operating a combined fleet of over 100 ships, totalling over 190,000 lower berths, and with new ships on order.[16] A 10th brand, stylised as fathom, was announced in June 2015, and commenced operations in April 2016.[17][18] Fathom operations will be discontinued in June 2017.[19] In 2011 the combined brands of the Carnival group controlled a 49.2% share of the total worldwide cruise market.[20] By late 2018, Carnival Corporation will be the first cruise company to use LNG on both the open sea and in port, when the company's first LNG-powered ship enters into service.[21] The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio.

AIDA Cruises[edit]
Main article: AIDA Cruises
AIDA Cruises originates from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany in 1952.[22] The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.[22] In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O, with the AIDA being repurchased from NCL. P&O subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.[22] From 2000 to 2003, AIDA Cruises was a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises plc and since the formation of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, it has been under the executive control of Costa Cruises Group, with corporate headquarters in Genoa, Italy and operational headquarters in Rostock, Germany.

Carnival Cruise Line[edit]
Main article: Carnival Cruise Line
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis.[3] Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2.[3] Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital.[3] The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.[3] Carnival continues to be the largest single brand within the Carnival group today, operating twenty six vessels.

Costa Cruises[edit]
Main article: Costa Cruises
Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854.[23] Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953.[23] The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.[23] Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours.[24] Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises is now one of the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.

Cunard Line[edit]
Main article: Cunard Line
The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O Cruises, Cunard Line originates from 1840 and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.[25] After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.[26] The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of the Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties.[27] To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.[28] Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996.[29] In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder.[30] Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.[31] Following the merger of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in 2003, executive control of the Cunard brand was transferred to Carnival UK, with corporate and operational headquarters in Southampton, England.

Holland America Line[edit]
Main article: Holland America Line
Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM).[32] The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including the SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973.[32] Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.[32] Since the formation of Carnival Corporation and plc in 2003, Holland America Line has been one of the principal operating companies of the Carnival Group, with corporate and operational headquarters in Seattle.

History[edit]
Carnival Corporation & plc was formed in 2003, with the acquisition by Carnival Corporation of P&O Princess Cruises.[7]
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions, and between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.[3]
P&O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O group.[8] Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O operated the world's first commercial passenger ships, the predecessor of modern cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O group in the 20th Century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises,[9] as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.[10]
Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.[11]
It was agreed that P&O Princess Cruises plc would remain as a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company would simply be renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group.[12]
Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007[13] and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.[14]
Current operations[edit]
The Carnival group now comprises 10 cruise line brands [15] operating a combined fleet of over 100 ships, totalling over 190,000 lower berths, and with new ships on order.[16] A 10th brand, stylised as fathom, was announced in June 2015, and commenced operations in April 2016.[17][18] Fathom operations will be discontinued in June 2017.[19] In 2011 the combined brands of the Carnival group controlled a 49.2% share of the total worldwide cruise market.[20] By late 2018, Carnival Corporation will be the first cruise company to use LNG on both the open sea and in port, when the company's first LNG-powered ship enters into service.[21] The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio.

AIDA Cruises[edit]
Main article: AIDA Cruises
AIDA Cruises originates from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany in 1952.[22] The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.[22] In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O, with the AIDA being repurchased from NCL. P&O subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.[22] From 2000 to 2003, AIDA Cruises was a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises plc and since the formation of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, it has been under the executive control of Costa Cruises Group, with corporate headquarters in Genoa, Italy and operational headquarters in Rostock, Germany.

Carnival Cruise Line[edit]
Main article: Carnival Cruise Line
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis.[3] Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2.[3] Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital.[3] The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.[3] Carnival continues to be the largest single brand within the Carnival group today, operating twenty six vessels.

Costa Cruises[edit]
Main article: Costa Cruises
Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854.[23] Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953.[23] The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.[23] Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours.[24] Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises is now one of the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.

Cunard Line[edit]
Main article: Cunard Line
The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O Cruises, Cunard Line originates from 1840 and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.[25] After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.[26] The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of the Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties.[27] To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.[28] Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996.[29] In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder.[30] Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.[31] Following the merger of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in 2003, executive control of the Cunard brand was transferred to Carnival UK, with corporate and operational headquarters in Southampton, England.

Holland America Line[edit]
Main article: Holland America Line
Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM).[32] The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including the SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973.[32] Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.[32] Since the formation of Carnival Corporation and plc in 2003, Holland America Line has been one of the principal operating companies of the Carnival Group, with corporate and operational headquarters in Seattle.

History[edit]
Carnival Corporation & plc was formed in 2003, with the acquisition by Carnival Corporation of P&O Princess Cruises.[7]
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions, and between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.[3]
P&O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O group.[8] Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O operated the world's first commercial passenger ships, the predecessor of modern cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O group in the 20th Century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises,[9] as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.[10]
Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.[11]
It was agreed that P&O Princess Cruises plc would remain as a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company would simply be renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group.[12]
Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007[13] and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.[14]
Current operations[edit]
The Carnival group now comprises 10 cruise line brands [15] operating a combined fleet of over 100 ships, totalling over 190,000 lower berths, and with new ships on order.[16] A 10th brand, stylised as fathom, was announced in June 2015, and commenced operations in April 2016.[17][18] Fathom operations will be discontinued in June 2017.[19] In 2011 the combined brands of the Carnival group controlled a 49.2% share of the total worldwide cruise market.[20] By late 2018, Carnival Corporation will be the first cruise company to use LNG on both the open sea and in port, when the company's first LNG-powered ship enters into service.[21] The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio.

AIDA Cruises[edit]
Main article: AIDA Cruises
AIDA Cruises originates from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany in 1952.[22] The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.[22] In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O, with the AIDA being repurchased from NCL. P&O subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.[22] From 2000 to 2003, AIDA Cruises was a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises plc and since the formation of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, it has been under the executive control of Costa Cruises Group, with corporate headquarters in Genoa, Italy and operational headquarters in Rostock, Germany.

Carnival Cruise Line[edit]
Main article: Carnival Cruise Line
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis.[3] Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2.[3] Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital.[3] The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.[3] Carnival continues to be the largest single brand within the Carnival group today, operating twenty six vessels.

Costa Cruises[edit]
Main article: Costa Cruises
Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854.[23] Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953.[23] The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.[23] Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours.[24] Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises is now one of the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.

Cunard Line[edit]
Main article: Cunard Line
The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O Cruises, Cunard Line originates from 1840 and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.[25] After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.[26] The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of the Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties.[27] To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.[28] Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996.[29] In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder.[30] Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.[31] Following the merger of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in 2003, executive control of the Cunard brand was transferred to Carnival UK, with corporate and operational headquarters in Southampton, England.

Holland America Line[edit]
Main article: Holland America Line
Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM).[32] The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including the SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973.[32] Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.[32] Since the formation of Carnival Corporation and plc in 2003, Holland America Line has been one of the principal operating companies of the Carnival Group, with corporate and operational headquarters in Seattle.

History[edit]
Carnival Corporation & plc was formed in 2003, with the acquisition by Carnival Corporation of P&O Princess Cruises.[7]
Carnival Corporation was founded as Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. The company grew steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s, making an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in 1987. The capital generated was used to finance acquisitions, and between 1989 and 1999, the company acquired Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, Westours, Seabourn Cruise Line, Costa Cruises and Cunard Line. The name Carnival Corporation was adopted in 1993, to distinguish the parent company from its flagship cruise line subsidiary.[3]
P&O Princess Cruises plc was formed in 2000, following the demerger of the cruise ship division of the P&O group.[8] Originating as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company in England in 1837, P&O operated the world's first commercial passenger ships, the predecessor of modern cruise ships. Restructuring of the P&O group in the 20th Century led to its cruise operations being rebranded as P&O Cruises and P&O Cruises Australia, with the company acquiring Princess Cruises in 1974. Following the demerger in 2000, the company also acquired AIDA Cruises,[9] as well as establishing the A'Rosa Cruises and Ocean Village brands.[10]
Prior to Carnival Corporation's acquisition, P&O Princess Cruises plc had agreed to a merger with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal unraveled as Carnival Corporation initiated a hostile takeover with improved terms for British shareholders.[11]
It was agreed that P&O Princess Cruises plc would remain as a separate company, listed on the London Stock Exchange and retaining its British shareholder body and management team. The company would simply be renamed Carnival plc, with the operations of the two companies merged into one entity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, jointly own all the operating companies in the Carnival group.[12]
Carnival sold Windstar Cruises to Ambassadors Group in February 2007[13] and Swan Hellenic to Lord Sterling in March 2007.[14]
Current operations[edit]
The Carnival group now comprises 10 cruise line brands [15] operating a combined fleet of over 100 ships, totalling over 190,000 lower berths, and with new ships on order.[16] A 10th brand, stylised as fathom, was announced in June 2015, and commenced operations in April 2016.[17][18] Fathom operations will be discontinued in June 2017.[19] In 2011 the combined brands of the Carnival group controlled a 49.2% share of the total worldwide cruise market.[20] By late 2018, Carnival Corporation will be the first cruise company to use LNG on both the open sea and in port, when the company's first LNG-powered ship enters into service.[21] The following operating companies have full executive control of the Carnival brands in their portfolio.

AIDA Cruises[edit]
Main article: AIDA Cruises
AIDA Cruises originates from the state-owned German shipping conglomerate Deutsche Seereederei, established in Rostock, Germany in 1952.[22] The company entered the passenger market in the 1960s, but after the unification of Germany in 1990, the company was privatised and its passenger ships acquired by Deutsche Seetouristik. In 1996, the company launched its first new cruise ship AIDA, but after failing to achieve a profit, the ship was sold to Norwegian Cruise Line, continuing operations under a charter agreement.[22] In 1999, Deutsche Seetouristik was acquired by British shipping company P&O, with the AIDA being repurchased from NCL. P&O subsequently formed AIDA Cruises as a subsidiary brand, with two new ships ordered to form a fleet. AIDA was renamed AIDAcara, with AIDAvita and AIDAaura launched in 2002 and 2003 respectively.[22] From 2000 to 2003, AIDA Cruises was a subsidiary of P&O Princess Cruises plc and since the formation of Carnival Corporation & plc in 2003, it has been under the executive control of Costa Cruises Group, with corporate headquarters in Genoa, Italy and operational headquarters in Rostock, Germany.

Carnival Cruise Line[edit]
Main article: Carnival Cruise Line
Carnival Cruise Line was founded in 1972 as a subsidiary of American International Travel Service (AITS), by Ted Arison and Meshulam Riklis.[3] Due to mounting debts, Riklis sold his stake in the company to Arison for $1 in 1974. However through the acquisition of existing ships, the company continued to grow and, in 1980, Carnival ordered its first new commission, the Tropicale, which was completed in 1981/2.[3] Three further ships were commissioned during the 1980s, the Holiday (1985), Jubilee (1986) and Celebration (1987). In 1987, Carnival completed an initial public offering of 20 percent of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, raising approximately $400m in capital.[3] The capital raised was used to finance acquisitions, so in 1993 the business was restructured as a holding company, under the name Carnival Corporation, with Carnival Cruise Line becoming its principal subsidiary.[3] Carnival continues to be the largest single brand within the Carnival group today, operating twenty six vessels.

Costa Cruises[edit]
Main article: Costa Cruises
Costa Cruises originates from a cargo shipping company founded by Giacomo Costa fu Andrea in Genoa, Italy in 1854.[23] Better known as Costa Line or C Line by the 1920s, its first passenger carrier was the Maria C, a former U.S. Navy stores ship that was partly converted for passenger use and served various routes to North and South America from 1947 to 1953.[23] The company's first dedicated passenger ship was the Anna C, a cargo vessel that was requisitioned for war time use by the Royal Navy and refitted as an accommodation ship before returning to merchant use.[23] Costa purchased the ship in 1947 and it operated between Italy and South America from 1948, later converting to full-time cruising and serving with the company until 1971. From the late 1960s until the 1980s, Costa rapidly developed its passenger operations into what we now recognise as modern cruise ships. Subsequently, in 1987, it consolidated its cruise ship operations into a new company, Costa Cruises, which at its peak, was the largest cruise ship operator in the world. The takeover of Costa Cruises by Carnival Corporation began in 1997, as a 50/50 deal between Carnival and the British tour operator Airtours.[24] Carnival then began purchasing Airtours' shares in the company, becoming the sole shareholder in September 2000. Costa Cruises is now one of the largest brands within the Carnival Group, with 15 ships.

Cunard Line[edit]
Main article: Cunard Line
The second oldest brand in the Carnival group after P&O Cruises, Cunard Line originates from 1840 and celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2015. It was founded by Samuel Cunard, who was awarded the first trans-Atlantic mail contract in 1837 and established the British and North American Royal Mail Steam-Packet Company in 1840.[25] After initially dominating the trans-Atlantic route, the need for new capital led to the company being re-organised as the Cunard Steamship Company Ltd in 1879.[26] The early 1900s saw increased competition for speed, particularly from Germany, which led the British government to subsidise the building of the Mauretania and Lusitania, which both won the Blue Riband. Competition continued to increase however and by the early 1930s, Cunard was experiencing financial difficulties.[27] To secure further government subsidy, it agreed to merge with its chief rival White Star Line, to form Cunard-White Star Line in 1934.[28] Cunard later purchased the remaining White Star shares in 1947, reverting to the name Cunard Line in 1949. Cunard continued to operate independently until 1971, when it was acquired by the conglomerate Trafalgar House, which was in turn taken over by the Norwegian company Kværner in 1996.[29] In 1998, Carnival Corporation purchased a controlling stake in Cunard, completing the acquisition in 1999 to become sole shareholder.[30] Since that time, Cunard has been one of Carnival's most high-profile brands, with the continued popularity of the famous Queen Elizabeth 2 and the development of the world's largest trans-Atlantic ocean liner Queen Mary 2, which continues to be the flagship of the fleet.[31] Following the merger of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc in 2003, executive control of the Cunard brand was transferred to Carnival UK, with corporate and operational headquarters in Southampton, England.

Holland America Line[edit]
Main article: Holland America Line
Holland America Line originated as Plate, Reuchlin & Company, founded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1871. Initially struggling to survive, the company went public in 1873, renamed Nederlandsch Amerikaansche Stoomvaart Maatschappij (NASM).[32] The company grew quickly in the early years, acquiring several new ships, including the SS Rotterdam, which operated the company's first passenger cruise in 1895. The company also quickly became known by its shortened English name, Holland America Line, which was officially adopted in 1869. By the early 1900s, the company had separated its cargo and passenger operations, with its passenger ships being identifiable by names ending with dam, a tradition which continues with Holland America cruise ships today. The development of container shipping in the 1960s, forced the company to make a decision between investing in new cargo ships, or cruise ships. It ultimately sold its cargo operations, becoming exclusively a cruise ship company in 1973.[32] Holland America continued to thrive well into the 1980s, consolidating its business with the acquisitions of Westours, Windstar Cruises and Home Lines. In 1989 however, it was itself the subject of an acquisition, when it was purchased in full by Carnival Corporation.[32] Since the formation of Carnival Corporation and plc in 2003, Holland America Line has been one of the principal operating companies of the Carnival Group, with corporate and operational headquarters in Seattle.

Carnival's Comment on Supply Chain


Our largest non-payroll operating expenditures are for fuel, food and beverages, 
travel agency services, port facility utilization, repairs and maintenance including 
dry-docking, air transportation services, advertising and marketing, hotel and 
restaurant products and supplies and communication services. Our largest capital 
investments are for the construction of new ships and improvements to existing 
ships, including our vessel enhancement program and scrubber installations.

Although we utilize a select number of suppliers for most of our food and beverages, 
  communication services, air transportation services and hotel and restaurant 
  products and supplies, most of these products and services are available from 
  multiple sources at competitive prices. The use of a select number of suppliers 
  enables us to, among other things, obtain volume discounts. We purchase fuel 
  and port facility services at some of our ports-of-call from a limited number 
  of maritime suppliers. Almost 50% of our fuel purchases are provided by five 
  suppliers.
 We perform our major dry-dock and ship improvement work at dry-dock facilities 
  in The Bahamas, Europe, the U.S., Canada, Singapore and Australia. We also purchase 
  repair, maintenance and refurbishment items from a limited number of maritime 
  suppliers. We believe there are sufficient dry-dock and shipbuilding facilities 
  and related suppliers to meet our anticipated repair, maintenance, ship improvement 
  and newbuild requirements.

                    Statistics and Market Data on Leisure Travel
                In this section statistics, facts and other information about the leisure travel / tourism industry are presented.

The tourism & travel sector includes everything related to leisure travel and vacations. Today, the tourism industry is one of the largest in the world with estimated annual contributions of almost seven trillion U.S. dollars worldwide. Vast improvements in technology and living conditions over the past century have led to the development and strong growth of tourism including phenomenons such as mass tourism.

According to figures published by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the total number of international tourist arrivals worldwide has more than doubled over the past twenty years. In 1995, the UNWTO counted around 530 million arrivals. In 2012, the number or arrivals exceeded one billion for the first time. Tourism is a big part of the economy and an important driver of growth. At the same time, topics like the inclusive development and environmental sustainability are becoming more important in the industry.

Many, mostly service-oriented industries benefit from tourism either directly or indirectly. Amongst those industries are airlines and other transportation services, the cruise ship industry, hospitality services, such as the accommodation industry, restaurants, resorts, and the wellness & spa industry. Entertainment venues, such as casinos, shopping malls, music venues, theatres, and amusement & theme parks are also, often at the same time, beneficiaries and drivers of tourism. Institutions, establishments and facilities like National Parks, monuments, historic sites and other recreational areas are also often amongst the things that make certain places attractive for touristic activities.

Carnival beats profit expectations and lifts outlook, but stock eases back from record close
Shares of Carnival Corp.  slipped 0.3% morning trade, pulling back slightly from the prior session's record close of $66.43, although the cruise operator reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and provided an upbeat outlook. Net profit for the quarter to May 31 fell to $379 million, or 52 cents a share, from $605 million, or 80 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as unrealized gains from derivatives contracts, adjusted earnings per share rose to 52 cents from 49 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 47 cents. Revenue rose to $3.95 billion from $3.71 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $3.88 billion, as both passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue topped expectations. The company said it expects third-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.16 to $2.20, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.14, and revised its full-year adjusted EPS outlook higher to $3.60 to $3.70 from $3.50 to $3.70. The stock has run up 27.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

Carnival beats profit expectations and lifts outlook, but stock eases back from record close
Shares of Carnival Corp.  slipped 0.3% morning trade, pulling back slightly from the prior session's record close of $66.43, although the cruise operator reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results and provided an upbeat outlook. Net profit for the quarter to May 31 fell to $379 million, or 52 cents a share, from $605 million, or 80 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, such as unrealized gains from derivatives contracts, adjusted earnings per share rose to 52 cents from 49 cents, beating the FactSet consensus of 47 cents. Revenue rose to $3.95 billion from $3.71 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $3.88 billion, as both passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue topped expectations. The company said it expects third-quarter adjusted EPS of $2.16 to $2.20, compared with the FactSet consensus of $2.14, and revised its full-year adjusted EPS outlook higher to $3.60 to $3.70 from $3.50 to $3.70. The stock has run up 27.5% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.8%.

 How to Become a Supplier for Carnival Cruise Lines | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  How to Become a Supplier for Carnival Cruise Lines  by Linda Ray        Offer a unique product to Carnival to increase your odds of landing a contract. Steve Mason/Photodisc/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 [Starbucks Food Supplier] | How to Become a Starbucks Food Supplier 2 [Ideas] | Marketing Ideas for Cruises 3 [Supplier Evaluation Checklist] | Supplier Evaluation Checklist 4 [Supplier] | How to Choose a Supplier    Becoming a Carnival Cruise Lines supplier could greatly increase your small business revenue, but expect to go through some hurdles first.        Carnival Cruise Lines is part of Carnival Corporation & PLC. Before trying to land a Carnival Cruise Line contract, keep in mind that the company has established suppliers for their basic needs. Your small business has a better chance of introducing the company to a new and innovative product rather than trying to get them to switch to your company for standard products such as towels, uniforms, soap and other commonly used items.       Carnival has headquarters in London, England, and Miami, Florida. At any one time, there are as many as 70,000 employees and 200,000 guests vacationing on Carnival Cruise Line ships.Undergo security training to receive the proper security clearances you’ll need to service ships while in port. You can go through training and receive your Coast Guard approved safety certification that complies with the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act from a company such as the Smart Security Group. You’ll need to provide Carnival buyers proof of your certification before you can submit bids to provide supplies to cruise lines in port.Contact the purchasing department at the company headquarters in Miami. You might have to start with an assistant who will provide you with the necessary documents you need to fill out to submit your proposals. Carnival, like most cruise lines, looks for innovation in supplies, according to World Cruise Industry Review.Include plans for delivery to the various ports that Carnival utilizes so that you can impress on the purchasing agent your ability to deliver the vast quantity of products the cruise line will need. Pare down your pitch to include only your local port if you have a unique local perishable item. For example, if you would like to supply the cruise liner with fresh crabs from Maryland, you’ll need to supply the buyer with a plan to deliver the products to specific ports on the Eastern seaboard during the crab season.Expect to provide large discounts for a sale of nonperishable items the company might use on all their 100 ships. You’ll need to show your ability to handle the large orders and deliver goods on time as needed. Tip  Join an industry association such as the Cruise Lines International Association. Get involved in seminars, networking opportunities and committees, and list your company in association publications. Connect with key decision makers at association events. For example, as an Executive Partner of the Cruise Lines International Association, you’ll be invited to private functions to discuss and tackle cruise line issues such as supply chain needs, safety issues and port deliveries. Offer the cruise line company local products that it can’t get anywhere else. With the stiff competition among cruise lines, companies such as Carnival look for unique offerings they can provide guests. Local products that could entice Carnival to use your company could include fresh, organic produce, cheese, beer and wine, bread and flowers. Offer the cruise lines a way to provide guests with new experiences as well, such as entertainment in the form of comedians, touring theatrical productions or local singing groups, meditation or yoga instruction, or a new form of massage or spa services.
