Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale 100%, 75%, 50% and 25% respectively, of the securities offered for sale by
the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise any amount as anticipated.

Number of shares sold               25%     50%     75%     100%  
Gross proceeds from this Offering $25,000 $50,000 $75,000 $100,000
Annual cost of being public       $10,000 $10,000 $10,000  $10,000
Office rent                        $4,000  $6,000  $8,000   $9,000
Website development                $4,000  $6,000  $7,000   $8,000
Marketing campaign                 $7,000 $25,000 $42,000  $58,000
Independent contractor fees             _  $3,000  $8,000  $15,000

There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this offering; any funds
received from the sale of stock by the Company will be immediately available to
us. The above figures represent only estimated costs. Mr. Bekess has agreed to
loan us funds to implement our business plan and maintain our reporting status
and quotation on the OTCBB or OTCQB until we raise funds from this offering. Mr.
Bekess is not obligated to loan us funds. Mr. Bekess will not be repaid from the
proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds
advanced by Mr. Bekess and the loan being intend at 0% per annum. Mr. Bekess
will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to
pay the obligation.

Annual cost of being public is $10,000; independent contractor fees ($3,000 if
we raised 50%, $8,000 if we raised 75% and 15,000 if we raised 100%).

Marketing campaign: Pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our
services. We are going to spend our funds on email marketing campaign. We will
allocate some funds on advertising of our website and services on beauty related
internet websites, products tasting events. We are going to pay for advertising
our service on Facebook. Also we will spend the fund on Linked-in, Twitter,
Google +and local media.

Amount to be paid to our independent contractor will be compensation for the
independent contractor’s services related to assembling, handling and shipping
the beauty boxes. Currently, we have not identified or hired an independent
contractor.

None of the proposed allocations set forth in the foregoing table is a firm
commitment by us. Projected expenditures are estimations or approximations only.
Actual expenditures will differ from projected expenditures if: (1) less than
the maximum offering is sold; (2) more funds than estimated are required to
accomplish the objectives set by management in a particular area; (3) a
particular objective can be obtained with less funding than anticipated; or (4)
the objectives set by management are determined to be unobtainable. To the
extent that the proposed objectives cannot be achieved for the scheduled
amounts, management may draw supplemental amounts from other categories of
estimated expenses (if available), from operating revenues (if any) or from
additional financing, the availability of which cannot be assured. Any amounts
not expended for scheduled purposes will be reallocated for general corporate
purposes. In the event we are not successful in selling all of the Units offered
herein, the amount allocated in the above table will be reduced proportionately
to the amount of proceeds actually received. 

The foregoing table does not give effect to any operating profits that we may
realize during the next 12 month period. If, in fact, working capital is
generated through operations (which cannot be assured) then additional funds
will be available to accomplish the corporate objectives.

Management believes that the proceeds of this offering plus operating revenues
will satisfy our net capital and cash requirements for at least 12 months
following the completion of this offering, provided that all of the Units
offered herein are sold. Even if all of the Units are sold, it is anticipated
they may need to obtain additional financing, either debt or equity, in order to
fully implement our business plan described herein. We do not have existing
arrangements to raise additional capital through bank loans or otherwise should
it be needed. There can be no assurance that any additional funds could be
secured on terms favorable to us, or that they could be secured at all.


We compete against a number of companies, most of which have substantially
greater resources than we do. The beauty business is characterized by vigorous
competition throughout the world. Brand recognition, advertising, promotion,
quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact
consumers’ choices among online beauty sample subscription services. Biggest
multinational competitors engaged in the online beauty supply business are:
birchbox.com, beautybar.com and glossybox.com.


Company Description
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 16, 2016. We intend to
engage in the business of selling beauty sample subscriptions. We intend to
implement a monthly subscription (approximately $15 with free shipping) for a
box full of beauty samples. This samples will be cosmetics, hair


 care, body
care, face care, fragrances, nail polish, skin care, bath and body, treatments
products, and other similar items. We will mail this box to subscribers once per
month. These samples will range from actual beauty products to protein bars.
This box will include cosmetics, nail polish, skin care, bath and body
treatments products and other similar items that will vary from month to month.

While no assurances can be provided, we anticipate that we will receive revenue
from the sale of these monthly subscriptions, as well as the sale of full sized
products we will be offering on our future website. Our monthly subscription
service will introduce customers to try products they may not be aware of or
have difficulty finding. Our main target market will be a woman in Europe and
North America.

As of the date of this Prospectus we have not sold any of those subscriptions
services nor have we generated any revenue from operations. Our operations to
date have been devoted primarily to start-up and development activities. Our
President, Andrejs Bekess, has performed all of those activities to date, which
include the following: 

· formation of our Company

· development of our business plan

· research regarding marketing methods and strategies, including advertising on 
  social media, retail stores, and online websites.          

· negotiation and execution of a Distribution Agreement with SIA “Glancebox.”

Our principal executive offices are located at Wattova 10, Ostrava 70200, Czech
Republic. Our phone number is (702)-605-4535. Email: boxxyinc@protonmail.com.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

 per share for the aggregate price set forth on the signature
page of this Agreement (U.S. dollars) (the  "Funds" )
pursuant to the Registration Statement. A copy of Prospectus

Purchaser by the Company. Together with this Subscription
Agreement, the Purchaser is delivering to the Company the full

Company has recommended that each Purchaser obtain independent
legal and financial advice prior to subscribing.

 

D.    Except as
set forth in this Agreement, no representations or warranties have
been made to the Purchaser by the Company or any agent,
employee or affiliate of the Company and in entering into
this transaction the Purchaser is not relying upon any information,
other than that contained in this Agreement and the result of
independent investigation by the Purchaser.

Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and this

enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with its
terms.

Purchaser hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Prospectus
under the Registration Statement relating to this offering and the
Shares (the  “Prospectus” ), which is on
file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The
