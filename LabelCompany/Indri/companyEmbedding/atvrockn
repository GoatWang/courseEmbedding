ATVRockn, as Ameritek Ventures, to enter optical fiber production market








June 29, 2017



Author
Stephen Hardy


Editorial Director and Associate Publisher






































ATVRockn (OTC PINK: ATVK) has announced plans to change its name to Ameritek Ventures and supply equipment for optical fiber production. The company says it has "identified multiple technologies" that it can combine with proprietary optical preform fabrication processes to differentiate itself in the market.
The Las Vegas based company plans to supply optical preforms to support the creation of commercial-grade fiber for communications-focused fiber-optic network applications. "The Company's equipment, processes, and managed system deployments will provide the market with the highest quality preforms used to manufacture fiber optic cable and will support significant growth worldwide," the company description at the bottom of a recent press release states.
A recent 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) lists Clinton L. Stokes III as chairman and CEO of the company. He succeeded former president, CEO, secretary, and director of the company Frank William Rycraft, Jr. on June 19. Stokes has a background in the mortgage industry.
The move into optical fiber preform manufacturing represents a significant departure from the company's initial focus. A Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 24, 2017 reveals that ATVRockn originally planned to market a "housing molding" product to place audio equipment and lighting on four-wheel drive vehicles such as utility terrain vehicles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs, hence the company's original name). The company discovered it wasn't adequately capitalized to produce the product and decided to enter a different business.[Native Advertisement]
At the time of the 10-Q filing, Stokes was the company's lone employee.

ATVRockn, as Ameritek Ventures, to enter optical fiber production market


lightwaveonline |
						Posted: 30 Jun 2017, 13:58

Share:











ATVRockn has announced plans to change its name to Ameritek Ventures and supply equipment for optical fiber production. The company says it has "identified multiple technologies" that it can combine with proprietary optical preform fabrication processes to differentiate itself in the market.
 
The Las Vegas based company plans to supply optical preforms to support the creation of commercial-grade fiber for communications-focused fiber-optic network applications. "The Company's equipment, processes, and managed system deployments will provide the market with the highest quality preforms used to manufacture fiber optic Cable and will support significant growth worldwide," the company description at the bottom of a recent press release states.
 
A recent 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) lists Clinton L. Stokes III as chairman and CEO of the company. He succeeded former president, CEO, secretary, and director of the company Frank William Rycraft, Jr. on June 19. Stokes has a background in the mortgage industry.
 
The move into optical fiber preform manufacturing represents a significant departure from the company's initial focus. A Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on April 24, 2017 reveals that ATVRockn originally planned to market a "housing molding" product to place audio equipment and lighting on four-wheel drive vehicles such as utility terrain vehicles and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs, hence the company's original name). The company discovered it wasn't adequately capitalized to produce the product and decided to enter a different business.

	Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim
	Financial Statements


	February 28, 2017




	 


	 




	NOTE 1 - CONDENSED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
	by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary
	to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows at February 28, 2017 and for all periods presented
	have been made.


	 


	Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
	in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
	been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial
	statements and notes thereto included in the Company's May 31, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of operations for
	the period ended February 28, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.


	 



	Basis of Presentation



	In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim balance
	sheets and related interim statements of income and cash flows include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items,
	necessary for their fair presentation in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	("U.S. GAAP"). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions the affect the reported
	amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management's estimates and assumptions.


	 


	 


	NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN


	 


	These condensed interim financial statements have been prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of
	assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of February 28, 2017, the Company
	has accumulated operating losses of $464,214 since inception. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
	upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations.


	 


	Management plans to raise equity capital to finance the operating
	and capital requirements of the Company. Amounts raised will be used to further development of the Company's products, to provide
	financing for marketing and promotion, to secure additional property and equipment, and for other working capital purposes. While
	the Company is putting forth its best efforts to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate
	funds that will be available for operations.

	ATVROCKN


	Notes to the Unaudited Condensed Interim
	Financial Statements


	February 28, 2017


	 


	 


	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's
	ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.


	 


	 


	NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
	generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
	amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	The Company's management has evaluated all the recently issued
	accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that any of these pronouncements
	will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.


	 


	 


	NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND CONTRIBUTED CAPITAL


	 



	Series B Preferred Stock



	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000
	shares of $0.001 par value Series B Preferred Stock. Series B Preferred Stock has liquidation and first position ownership rights
	on any assets owned by the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock has no voting rights and are not entitled to receive dividends.
	The holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to interest payments on monies paid or loaned to the corporation for
	their Series B Preferred Shares and a first position in a security interest on any assets of the Company upon default of a loan
	to the Company, liquidation or dissolution of the Company. Further, the Company may call these shares at any time provided the
	holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are paid the amount of monies they paid for their Series B Preferred Stock along with any
	interest due. Upon the payment of principal and interest to the Series B Preferred Stock shareholders, the shares must be returned
	to the Company.


	 


	On May 24, 2011, the Company issued
	25,000 shares of its Series B Preferred Stock to a shareholder and former director upon execution of a Promissory Note for cash
	of $25,000 and a collateral security interest in the Company's molding tool. The loan was to accrue interest of $1,250 per quarter
	until the note is paid-in-full, with the first payment due on November 30, 2011. On January 28, 2014, the shareholder and former
	director forgave the debt owed and returned 25,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for cancellation. As of February 28, 2017,
	there is no Series B Preferred Stock outstanding.

	Series A Preferred Stock



	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $0.001
	par value Series A Preferred Stock, of which 122,500 shares are issued and outstanding as of February 28, 2017. Series A Preferred
	Stock have no liquidation rights. Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to receive any dividends nor are they entitled
	to any voting rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock. At any time and from time-to-time after the issuance of the
	Series A Preferred Stock, any holder may convert any or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder at the
	ratio of one hundred (100) shares of Common Stock for every one (1) share of Series A Preferred Stock. However, the beneficial
	owner of such Series A Preferred Stock cannot convert their Series A Preferred stock where they will beneficially own in excess
	of 4.9% of the shares of the Common Stock.


	 


	On May 31, 2011, the Company issued 125,000 shares of its
	Series A Preferred Stock to shareholders in exchange for cash of $12,500. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock can be exchanged
	for one hundred (100) shares of Common Stock of the Company. This Series A Preferred Stock was issued with a beneficial conversion
	feature totaling $112,500. This non-cash expense related to the beneficial conversion features of those securities and is recorded
	with a corresponding credit to paid-in-capital. If the issued and outstanding preferred stock were to be converted into common
	stock, and each beneficial owner held less than 4.9% of the stock, the common stock would be increased by 12,500,000 shares.


	 


	During the year ended May 31, 2015, two shareholders who
	owned 2,500 registered shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, exercised the conversion feature of the Preferred Stock and they
	converted their shares into common stock and received 250,000 registered common shares.


	 


	On September 22, 2016 Arden A. Johnson, who was the beneficial
	owner of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, entered into an agreement whereby he sold his ownership in Legal
	Beagle Services to J. Chad Guidry who subsequent to year-end is now currently the beneficial owner of the Company’s Series
	A Convertible Preferred Stock.


	 



	Series C Preferred Stock



	 


	The Company is authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of $0.001
	par value Series C Preferred Stock, of which no shares are issued and outstanding. The designation of these shares have yet to
	be determined by the Board of Directors.

	its $0.001 par value common stock, of which 6,900,004 shares are issued and outstanding as of February 28, 2017.


	 


	On September 14, 2016, the Company underwent a change of
	control of ownership. Hal Heyer, former CEO of the Company, entered into an agreement on September 23, 2016 whereby he sold his
	ownership of 5,100,000 control block shares to Mark Cole. Mark Cole paid cash consideration of ten thousand ($10,000) for the 5,100,000
	control block shares. The terms of this agreement were fulfilled on September 20, 2016.

	On November 19, 2014, Hal Heyer, M.D., personally loaned
	$250,000 to VoCare, Inc., an Indiana company. The $250,000 Promissory Note pays 12% interest per annum with a maturity date of
	December 31, 2017. On December 10, 2014, Hal Heyer, M.D., assigned this Promissory Note to ATVRockN. On June 2, 2015, VoCare, Inc.
	repaid a portion of the Promissory Note in the amount of $120,000 directly to Hal Heyer, M.D., the payment was recorded as a reduction
	of the Promissory Note as well as a non-cash distribution and related reduction in paid-in-capital in the quarter-ended August
	31, 2015. During the quarter ended November 30, 2015, the Company recorded a valuation adjustment for the outstanding interest
	that had accrued per the terms of the original terms of the promissory note.


	 


	In conjunction with the change of control
	of ownership as described above, Hal Heyer agreed to leave the remaining note receivable amount of $130,000 due from Vocare, Inc.
	with the Company. The Company has analyzed the collectability of this receivable and as a result has recorded a $130,000 valuation
	allowance against the promissory note receivable asset. The Company expects to aggressively pursue collection of the note receivable
	and is optimistic about receiving some value in the future. The remaining unpaid balance as of February 28, 2017 is $130,000.


	 


	As of February 28, 2017, there have been no stock options
	or warrants granted.

	property. Office services are provided without charge by a director. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and,
	accordingly, have not been reflected therein. The officers and directors of the Company are involved in other business activities

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	There have been no material changes
	to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis
	of Financial Condition and Results of Operations", included in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May
	31, 2016.


	 



	History and Organization



	 


	ATVRockN (the "Company" or
	the "Registrant") was incorporated on December 27, 2010 as ATVRockN, as a Nevada Company. We consider ourselves to be
	an emerging growth company under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements.


	 


	11


	 



	 



	 



	 



	Business of Issuer



	 


	Under our original business plan, it
	was our intention to

	market a "housing


	molding"
	product to place audio equipment and lighting on 4-wheel drive vehicles such as

	All Terrain Vehicles (“ATV”)
	and Utility Terrain Vehicles (“UTV”). We did not manufacturer any units, we utilize the services of a contract manufacturer
	to make the unit for us. We had no material agreement with our contract manufacturer other than we pay them to produce product
	for us based on our needs. As we are undercapitalized, we were unable to produce the required housing molding(s) we believe would
	best sell in the ATV/UTV aftermarket.


	 



	Overview



	 


	Management is currently seeking new
	business opportunities referred by various sources, including its officer/director, professional advisors, venture capitalists,
	members of the financial community, and others who may present unsolicited proposals.


	 


	We will seek businesses from all known
	sources, but will rely principally on personal contacts of the officer/director and his affiliates, as well as indirect associations
	between him and other business and professional people.


	 


	We will not restrict our search to any
	particular business, industry, or geographical location, and management reserves the right to evaluate and enter into any type
	of business in any location. It may participate in a newly organized business venture. On the other hand, we may select a more
	established company entering a new phase of growth or in need of additional capital to overcome existing financial problems.


	 


	In seeking a business venture, the decision
	of management will not be controlled by an attempt to take advantage of any anticipated or perceived appeal of a specific industry,
	management group, product, or industry, but will be based on the business objective of seeking long-term capital appreciation in
	the real value for ATVRockN.


	 


	The period within which we may participate
	in a business on completion of this offering cannot be predicted and will depend on circumstances beyond our control, including
	the availability of businesses, the time required to complete our investigation and analysis of prospective businesses, the time
	required to prepare appropriate documents and agreements providing for our


	participation, and other circumstances.
	It is anticipated that the analysis of specific proposals and the selection of a business will take several months.


	 


	It is possible that we may propose to
	acquire a business in the development stage. A business is in the development stage if it is devoting most of its efforts to establishing
	a new business, and planned principal operations have either not commenced or not yet resulted in significant revenues.


	 


	12



	 



	 



	 


	 



	Competition



	 


	We will be involved in intense competition
	with other business entities, many of which will have a competitive edge over us by virtue of their more substantial financial
	resources and prior experience in business. We also face numerous other smaller companies at the same stage of development as we
	are.


	 


	 



	Patents, Trademarks and Licenses



	 


	We do not have any trademarks, patents,
	or other intellectual property.


	 


	Based on the nature of our business,
	we do not expect to file any trademarks or patents.


	 


	 



	Properties



	 


	The Company's corporate headquarters
	are located at: 2251 N. Rampart Blvd., Suite 207, Las Vegas, NV 89128. The Company does not own any real property.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	For the three and nine month periods
	ending February 28, 2017 and February 29, 2016, the Company recognized no revenues.


	 


	For the three month period ending February
	28, 2017, the Company incurred total operating losses of $0. This compares to the same period ending February 29, 2016 where the
	Company incurred total operating losses of $227, which consisted of professional fees. The net loss applicable to common shareholders
	was $0 for the three months ending February 28, 2017 or $(0.00) per common share basic and diluted for the period ending as compared
	to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $(130,227) or $(0.02) per common share for the same period last year.


	 


	For the six month period ending February
	28, 2017, the Company incurred total operating losses of $6,000. This compares to the same period ending February 29, 2016 where
	the Company incurred total operating losses of $6,000, which consisted of professional fees. The net loss applicable to common
	shareholders was $(6,000) for the six months ending February 28, 2017 or $(0.00) per common share basic and diluted for the period
	ending as compared to a net loss applicable to common shareholders of $(152,394) or $(0.02) per common share for the same period
	last year.


	 


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	Our ability to continue as a going concern
	is contingent upon the successful completion of additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain profitable
	operations.


	 


	Therefore, management plans to raise
	equity capital to finance the operating and capital requirements of the Company. While the Company is devoting its best efforts
	to achieve the above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds that will be available for operations.
	These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

	Summary of product research and development
	that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation.



	 


	We have no plans to perform any product
	research and development at this time.


	 



	Expected purchase or sale of plant
	and significant equipment



	 


	We do not anticipate the purchase or
	sale of any plant or significant equipment; as such items are not required by us at this time.


	 



	Significant changes in the number
	of employees



	 



	ATVRockN

	currently has one employee, its CEO. We are dependent upon our sole officer and director for our future business development. As
	our operations expand, we anticipate the need to hire additional employees, consultants and professionals; however, the exact number
	is not quantifiable at this time.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of February 28, 2017, ATVRockN had
	$0 in cash and cash equivalents and total current assets of $0, with long-term assets of $0. As of February 28, 2017, ATVRockN
	had total current liabilities of $86,835.


	 


	The Company has limited financial resources
	available, which has had an adverse impact on the Company's liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely
	affected the Company's ability to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. Without realization of additional capital,
	it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern. Management intends to raise additional debt or equity financing
	to fund ongoing operations and necessary working capital. However, there is no assurance that such financing plans will be successful
	or be obtained in amounts sufficient to meet the Company’s needs.


	 


	Notwithstanding, ATVRockN anticipates
	generating losses and therefore may be unable to continue operations in the future. ATVRockN anticipates it will require additional
	capital in order to develop its business. ATVRockN may use a combination of equity and/or debt instruments to funds its growth
	strategy or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party.


	 


	 


	 


	 


	15


	 


	 



	 



	 



	 


	Management is currently exploring various
	business strategies to help the Company's business. This includes evaluating various options and strategies. The analysis of new
	business opportunities and evaluating new business strategies will be undertaken by the Company's management. In analyzing prospective
	businesses opportunities, the Company will consider, to the extent applicable, the available technical, financial and managerial
	resources of any given business venture. Part of the evaluation will also consider the nature of present and expected competition;
	the potential for growth and expansion; the likelihood of sustaining a profit within given time frames; the perceived public recognition
	or acceptance of products, services, trade or service marks; name identification; and other relevant factors.


	 


	The Company anticipates that the results
	of operations of a specific business venture may not necessarily be indicative of the potential for future earnings, which may
	be impacted by a change in marketing strategies, business expansion, modifying product emphasis, changing or substantially augmenting
	management, and other factors. Management will analyze all relevant factors and make a determination based on a composite of available
	information, without reliance on any single factor.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet
	arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
	condition, revenues or expenses, results or operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
	investors.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	Revenue Recognition: The Company recognizes
	revenue related to product sales when (i) persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists, (ii) shipment has occurred, (iii) the
	fee is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.


	 



	Recent Pronouncements



	 


	The Company's management has evaluated
	all the recently issued accounting pronouncements through the filing date of these financial statements and does not believe that
	any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

	Not applicable.

	Item 4T. Controls and Procedures


	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures



	 


	Our disclosure controls and procedures,
	as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
	are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded,
	processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms adopted by the SEC, and that such information
	is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, to allow
	timely decisions regarding required disclosures.


	 


	Management, with the participation of
	the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, who is also the sole member of our Board of Directors, has evaluated
	the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on such
	evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of February 28, 2017, our disclosure
	controls and procedures were not effective. Our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the "material
	weaknesses" described below under "Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting," which
	are in the process of being remediated as described below under "Management Plan to Remediate Material Weaknesses."


	 



	Management's Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting, as defined in rules
	promulgated under the Exchange Act, is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Accounting Officer and affected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
	Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:


	 



	·


	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
	accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;



	 



	·


	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our Board of Directors; and



	 



	·


	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
	of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements



	17




	Because of its inherent limitations,
	a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
	of the control system are met and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Internal control over financial reporting is a process
	that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.
	Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations,
	there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial
	reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design
	into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Further, over time control may become inadequate because
	of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Our management assessed the effectiveness
	of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2017. In making its assessment, management used the criteria
	established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	("COSO"). Based on its assessment, management has concluded that we had certain control deficiencies described below
	that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, our internal controls over
	financial reporting was not effective as of February 28, 2017.


	 


	A "material weakness" is defined
	under SEC rules as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there
	is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis by the company's internal controls. As a result of management's review of the investigation issues
	and results, and other internal reviews and evaluations that were completed after the end of the quarter ending February 28, 2017,
	related to the preparation of management's report on internal controls over financial reporting required for this quarterly report
	on Form 10-Q, management concluded that we had material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting
	of the following:


	 


	1) lack
	of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors
	on our board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls
	and procedures; and


	 


	2) insufficient
	written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP
	and SEC disclosure requirements.


	 


	We do not believe the material weaknesses
	described above caused any meaningful or significant misreporting of our financial condition and results of operations for the
	period ended February 28, 2017. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority
	of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required
	internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.


	 


	18





	Management Plan to Remediate Material
	Weaknesses



	 


	Management is pursuing the implementation
	of corrective measures to address the material weaknesses described below. In an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses
	and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:


	 


	We plan to appoint one or more outside
	directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee
	who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing
	and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us. Additionally, we will create written
	policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and
	SEC disclosure requirements


	 


	We believe the remediation measures
	described above will remediate the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal control over financial reporting.
	We are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently and vigorously review
	our financial reporting controls and procedures. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial
	reporting, we may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify, or in appropriate
	circumstances not to complete, certain of the remediation measures described above.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control over
	Financial Reporting



	 


	There were no changes in our internal
	control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most
	recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting.


	 


	In May 2013, COSO released an updated
	version of its Internal Control - Integrated Framework ("2013 Framework"). Initially issued in 1992, the original framework
	("1992 Framework") provided guidance to organizations to design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of internal
	control concepts and simplify their use and application. The 2013 Framework is intended to improve upon systems of internal control
	over external financial reporting by formalizing the principles embedded in the 1992 Framework, incorporating business and operating
	environment changes and increasing the framework’s ease of use and application. The 1992 Framework remained available until
	December 15, 2014, after which it was superseded by the 2013 Framework. As of February 28, 2017, the Company has transitioned to
	the 2013 Framework. The Company did not experience significant changes to its internal control over financial reporting as a result
	from the transition to the 2013 Framework.


	 


	This report does not include an attestation
	report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report
	was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit
	the Company to provide only the management's report in this report.






	 





	PART II. OTHER INFORMATION



	 




	Item 1 - Legal Proceedings


	 


	From time to time, we may become involved
	in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent
	uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.


	 


	We are not presently a party to any
	material litigation, nor to the knowledge of management is any litigation threatened against us, which may materially affect us.
