Each extended-stay guestroom features a My Kitchen.

LUBBOCK, TX—My Place Hotel opened its doors here on Nov. 2. The newly built, four-story hotel features 63 rooms. Located at 6219 62nd St., it is accessible to Texas Tech University, the medical district and Jones AT&T Stadium in addition to area dining, shopping and entertainment options.
Texas’s second My Place Hotel is independently owned by 6219 62nd Street, LLC and was developed by KAMP Hotels, LLC, who opened its first hotel in Amarillo earlier this year. While KAMP Hotels remains the majority owner of the new Lubbock hotel entity, the My Place family is now much larger due to the fact that the new entity has a number of additional owners, according to the company.
“We think Lubbock is more than ready for a new and fresh economy, extended-stay product that is conveniently located near the Marsha Sharp Freeway and Milwaukee Avenue, only minutes away from Texas Tech and the medical district.” said Kevin Nelson, principal, KAMP Hotels. “We are confident Lubbock will appreciate and enjoy the My Place philosophy of skipping the unnecessary extras in favor of a great room at a reasonable price.”
The new hotel is the second of 30 hotels planned for Texas and the surrounding region. KAMP’s third My Place Hotel is under development in Fort Worth, TX.
“It’s been a tremendous pleasure to continue our franchise partnership with Kevin Nelson, Alan Rhodes and their family at KAMP Hotels at their brand new location in Lubbock, TX,” said Terry Kline, EVP Franchise Development, My Place Hotels of America, LLC. “We optimistically look forward to a long and rewarding relationship with KAMP as they continue their work in introducing Texas and the surrounding region to America’s newest and best extended-stay hotels.”
Each extended-stay guestroom features a My Kitchen, complete with a two-burner cooktop, a microwave and a full refrigerator. The property is pet friendly and will also include on-site laundry facilities, complimentary high-speed internet service and a 24-hour My Store, located in the hotel lobby. Additionally, there is a new breakfast-in-bed option.

With Rise in Travel Spending, Dreams Can Come True
        I took a summer vacation to Alaska. This natural beauty of a state might be our 49th, but it was my 50th. Why all this talk of my summer vacation? Well, Allianz Global Assistance (AGA) just released data earlier this week saying that Americans are spending more on summer vacations this year, topping $100 billion for the first time in the AGA survey’s eight-year history. This represents a 12.5% increase over last year.

My Place Opens Second Texas Hotel

Posted by: Lodging Staff 
in Development, Finance + Development, Openings
November 4, 2016



LUBBOCK, Texas—The Hub City’s travelers now have a fresh lodging option in Lubbock’s newest hotel. My Place Hotel—Lubbock opened its doors on Nov. 2. The newly built, 4-story hotel features 63 rooms perfectly suited for nightly or extended stays. The hotel is located at 6219 62nd Street where guests enjoy easy access to Texas Tech University, the medical district, and Jones AT&T Stadium in addition to the diverse dining, shopping and entertainment options in the immediate area.
Texas’s second My Place Hotel is independently owned by 6219 62nd Street and was developed by KAMP Hotels, LLC, who opened its first hotel in Amarillo earlier this year. While KAMP Hotels remains the majority owner of the new Lubbock hotel entity, the My Place family is now much larger due to the fact that the new entity has a number of additional owners that share KAMP’s excitement and enthusiasm for the My Place concept.
My Place Hotel—Lubbock opens in the midst of a highly attended football season at Texas Tech University. Among the many visiting Texas Tech fans are the principals behind KAMP Hotels, Kevin Nelson and Alan Rhodes, who both earned their law degrees from Texas Tech. Nelson and Rhodes also completed their undergraduate degrees in Lubbock at Texas Tech and Lubbock Christian University, respectively.
Nelson said KAMP Hotels and the entire My Place team have worked hard to bring the exciting new hotel product to Lubbock. Now that an additional My Place is open for business in yet another city they love, Nelson said Lubbock guests can officially make My Place their place.
“Alan and I have great affinity for Lubbock since we received both our undergraduate and our law degrees here,” Nelson said. “We think Lubbock is more than ready for a new and fresh economy, extended stay product that is conveniently located near the Marsha Sharp Freeway and Milwaukee Avenue, only minutes away from Texas Tech and the medical district. We are confident Lubbock will appreciate and enjoy the My Place philosophy of skipping the unnecessary extras in favor of a great room at a reasonable price.”
My Place Hotel-Lubbock will celebrate its grand opening alongside members of the community on Nov. 9. Attendees will receive an in-depth look at the new facility and learn about the My Place concept. The event will feature food and beverages from Texas Tech’s StrEat Food Truck, Llano Estacado Winery, and McAllister’s Deli.
“It’s been a tremendous pleasure to continue our franchise partnership with Kevin Nelson, Alan Rhodes and their family at KAMP Hotels at their brand new location in Lubbock, Texas,” said Terry Kline, EVP Franchise Development, My Place Hotels of America.

Lubbock is now home to the second My Place Hotel in Texas. 


 


More than 100 people attended a ribbon cutting and grand-opening ceremony Wednesday at the new hotel, located at 6219 62nd St.Mike Lambert, Lubbock Chamber of Commerce Ambassador Program chairman, welcomed the new hotel's owners and staff to Lubbock. “We do about 200 of these a year and this is a phenomenal turnout,” Lambert said. “I think it’s a testament to the hard work that you guys have put in and the work that you are going to do to help make this new hotel a success in Lubbock. The community is lucky to have you guys.”The newly built four-story hotel features 63 rooms for nightly or extended stays. My Place Hotel was developed by KAMP Hotels, LLC, which opened its first hotel in Amarillo earlier this year. Lubbock’s My Place Hotel is independently owned by 6219 62nd Street, LLC.KAMP Hotels is run by Kevin Nelson and Alan Rhodes, who both earned their law degrees from Texas Tech. Nelson and Rhodes also completed their undergraduate degrees in Lubbock at Tech and Lubbock Christian University.Kevin Nelson, KAMP Hotels partner, said he is glad to have the My Place Hotel brand in the Hub City. “Alan and I have great affinity for Lubbock since we received both our undergraduate and our law degrees here,” Nelson said. “We think Lubbock is more than ready for a new and fresh economy, extended-stay product that is conveniently located near the Marsha Sharp Freeway and Milwaukee Avenue, only minutes away from Texas Tech and the medical district.”Ryan Rivett, My Place Hotel president and chief operating officer, said that after opening Texas’ first My Place hotel in Amarillo, he had reservation on opening the second in Lubbock, but after visiting the Hub City he knew it was a good fit.“I only have been to Lubbock three times, and when they first said we’re going to build one in Lubbock I said, ‘I don’t know about that,’ ” Rivett said. “We came here and we took a look and I really love the energy that is in this place. We developed My Place to be economy, extended stay, but that really just defines the price. It doesn’t really define the quality of service and the quality that a guest feels when the stay in the hotel. ” All My Place Hotels offer nightly, weekly and monthly rate options. Each extended-stay guest room features a My Kitchen, complete with a two-burner cooktop, a microwave and a full refrigerator. The property is pet friendly and also includes on-site laundry facilities, complimentary high-speed internet service and a 24-hour My Store, located in the hotel lobby.Monica Tracy, My Place Hotel Lubbock general manager, said the new hotel will offer Lubbockites and the city’s visitors a home away from home.“What I am pledging to everyone in Lubbock is we are going to make My Place your place,” Tracy said. “It’s really about being a home away from home.” For more information, visit myplacehotels.com.denise.marquez@lubbockonline.com• 766-8754Follow Denise on Twitter @DMarquezAJ

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
