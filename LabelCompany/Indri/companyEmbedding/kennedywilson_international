Tracking Prem Watsa's Fairfax Financial Holdings Portfolio - Q4 2016 Update - Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (OTCMKTS:FRFHF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Tracking Prem Watsa's Fairfax Financial Holdings Portfolio - Q4 2016 UpdateFeb.20.17 | About: Fairfax Financial (FRFHF) John Vincent Long only, value, special situations, fund holdingsOne Family's BlogSummaryPrem Watsa's US long portfolio increased from $1.11B to $1.17B this quarter.Fairfax Financial;s largest five 13F stakes are BlackBerry, Kennedy-Wilson, International Business Machines, Resolute Forest Products, and Overstock.com. They together account for ~87% of the US long assets.The 13F portfolio is a small portion of their overall investment portfolio.This article is part of a series that provides an ongoing analysis of the changes made to Prem Watsa's US stock portfolio on a quarterly basis. It is based on Watsa's regulatory 13F Form filed on 02/13/2017. Please visit our Tracking Prem Watsa's Fairfax Financial Holdings Portfolio series to get an idea of his investment philosophy and our previous update for the fund's moves during Q3 2016. This quarter, Watsa's US long portfolio increased ~5% from $1.11B to $1.17B. There are 29 13F securities in the portfolio, but it is concentrated among a few large stakes. The focus of this article is on the larger (greater than 0.5% of the portfolio each) holdings. The top five positions represent ~87% of the US long assets. The top three holdings are BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY), Kennedy-Wilson (NYSE:KW), and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and together they account for more than two-thirds of the entire 13F portfolio. Note: Fairfax Financial (OTCPK:FRFHF) had a negative view on equities, and the stock portfolio was hedged 112.7% as of September 30, 2016. The US election results prompted a huge change: equity hedges removed, and bond portfolio duration shortened to one year. The 13F holdings only represent a small portion of the overall investment portfolio. The total size of their investment portfolio as of Q4 2016 was $27.29B, of which 37.4% is in cash and short-term positions. The cash allocation is up a lot compared to 19.3% as of last quarter. They still have a huge position in CPI-linked derivative contracts ($110.4B notional amount, $83.4M fair value, 5.6 years average maturity) designed to protect against global deflation. FRFHF currently trades at $473 compared to a book value of ~$367.
 Stake Decreases: International Business Machines : IBM is a large (top-three) ~19% of the US long portfolio position established in Q3 2014 at prices between $181 and $196. The stake was increased by ~28% in Q4 2014 at prices between $151 and $190. The stock currently trades at $181. For investors attempting to follow Watsa, IBM is a good option to consider for further research. This quarter saw marginal trimming. Baldwin & Lyons Inc. (NASDAQ:BWINB): BWINB was a small 2.24% of the portfolio position last quarter. This quarter saw a ~60% reduction to a very small 0.81% stake at prices between $23.50 and $27.50. The stock is now at $23. It is a very long-term stake that was kept steady over many years. The large reduction this quarter indicates a bearish bias. Stake Increases: Kennedy-Wilson Holdings: The KW stake is the second-largest position at ~22% of the US long portfolio. Watsa's ownership stake in the business is ~11%. This quarter saw a ~40% increase at prices between $20 and $23. KW currently trades at $21.30. Note: The original stake is from a 2010 private placement for Kennedy-Wilson convertible preferred stock. The total investment from that point through Q3 2016 was $645M. Over the years, they received distributions of $625M, and so the net investment was only $20M. This quarter, they invested another ~$70M. That is compared to a current market value of ~$260M. Exco Resources (NYSE:XCO): XCO is a ~2% of the US long portfolio stake first purchased in Q1 2012. The bulk of the current position was purchased in Q4 2012 at prices between $6.50 and $9. Q4 2015 saw another ~50% increase at prices between $0.75 and $1.36. The stock currently trades at $0.64. Watsa controls ~10% of the business. This quarter saw a minor ~8% increase. Note: In January 2014, XCO had a rights offering (one new share at $5 for every four shares of XCO held), and Watsa increased his stake from 10.81M shares to 17.54M shares as a result. Prem Watsa, along with Wilbur Ross, agreed to backstop the offering, thereby acquiring more shares than what they would have received by exercising their rights.
 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): JNJ is a long-term position that has been in the portfolio since 2007. The original stake was 5.9M shares purchased at a cost basis of $62.29. In Q3 2013, roughly half the position was sold at prices between $85.50 and $94.50, and in the following quarter, the remaining stake was almost eliminated at prices between $85.50 and $96. This quarter saw an about-turn: an ~80% increase at prices between $111 and $120. The stock currently trades at $119, and the position is still very small at ~1.5%. US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and USG Corp. (NYSE:USG): These were minutely small stakes last quarter. They were both increased to significantly large positions this quarter. The ~1.8% USB stake was purchased at prices between $42.50 and $52.50, and the stock is now above that range at $54.88. The ~0.9% USG position was established at prices between $24 and $32, and the stock currently trades just above that range at $32.74. Kept Steady: BlackBerry Inc.: BBRY is Watsa's largest position at ~28% of the US long portfolio. The stake was first purchased in 2010 at around $50 for 2M shares. Since then, the position was aggressively built up to 46.7M shares (~9% of the business). His cost basis is ~$17, and the stock currently trades at $7.49. There has only been very minor activity in the last two years.   Note: In Q4 2013, Fairfax co-sponsored a cash-infusion of $1B through convertible debentures ($10 conversion price earning 6% interest) - they financed $500M of that transaction and the remaining was funded by a consortium of other investment funds - the implied dilution took their ownership up to ~16.5% of the business. In Q3 2016, those shares were redeemed and new ones issued ($605M in 3.75% debentures convertible at $10 due 11/13/2020) to the same entities in a private placement. Resolute Forest Products (NYSE:RFP): RFP is the fourth-largest holding at ~14% of the US long portfolio. The stake was first established in Q4 2010, when it was named Abitibi Bowater, and the position has since been more than doubled. In Q2 2013, the original stake was increased by ~17% at prices between $12.50 and $16.50. Q2 2016 saw another ~5% increase at prices between $4.75 and $6.75 Watsa's cost basis on RFP is much higher than the current quote of around $4.65. The stock lost ~55% in 2015, and it has since lost another ~40%.
 Overstock.com Inc. (NASDAQ:OSTK): OSTK is a top-five position at ~5% of the US long portfolio. The original stake was purchased in Q4 2008 at prices between $9 and $17, and has since been kept relatively steady. The stock currently trades at $18.60. Note: Regulatory filings since the quarter ended show Fairfax no longer holds Overstock shares. The exit happened at ~$16 per share. Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP): HP was a minutely small stake as of Q3 2015. The following quarter saw the position built up to the current 2.32% of the portfolio stake at prices between $46.50 and $61. The stock is currently at $68.26. POSCO ADR (NYSE:PKX): PKX is a very small 0.86% of the US long portfolio stake established in Q3 2015 at prices between $34.50 and $51. The stock currently trades at $62.06. Leucadia National (NYSE:LUK) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE): These two very small stakes (less than ~1% of the portfolio each) were kept steady this quarter. The 13F portfolio also has numerous very small equity positions (less than ~0.5% of the US long portfolio each) that add up to a total allocation ~1.5%. These are Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), Colfax Corp. (NYSE:CFX), Destination Maternity Corp. (NASDAQ:DEST) (previously Mothers Work), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), K12 Inc. (NYSE:LRN), Monsanto Company (NYSE:MON), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV), NetEase Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), New Oriental Education (NYSE:EDU), Rayonier Advanced Materials (NYSE:RYAM), Team Health Holdings (NYSE:TMH), Turquoise Hill Resources (NYSE:TRQ), The Valspar Corp. (NYSE:VAL), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC). Note: Blackstone (NYSE:BX) acquired Team Health at $43.50 per share in a transaction that closed earlier this month. BX had originally brought it public at the end of 2009 at ~$15 per share. The spreadsheet below highlights changes to Watsa's US stock holdings in Q4 2016:
