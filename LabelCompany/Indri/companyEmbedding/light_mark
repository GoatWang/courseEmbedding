Contemporary lighting is an updated mix of the latest trends and styles. Classified by simple smooth angles, grays, monochromes, mixed with clear or white glass.
	




Modern lighting is characterized by clean, sharp lines dominantly in brushed steels and chromes. Modern Lighting transforms lighting fixtures into an artpiece for your home.
	




Traditional lighting is characterized by smooth classic lines that range a variety of historical periods and will make any home look more elegant.
	






Transitional lighting is defined as a mix of contemporary and traditional. This style fuses two top selling styles into one beautiful design for your space.
	




Rustic lighting is known for use of earthy tones, sturdy wrought irons and antler decorations. Rustic lighting fits in everything from a cabin, home in the mountains, or home in the suburbs.
	




Colonial lighting is marked by simple, traditional lines often combined with the use of basic woods or irons. Lanterns, chandeliers and wall sconces with candle-style bulbs make a simple yet attractive luminaire for any space.

Voltage

Low Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on low voltage direct current (DC) between 12V and 24V. They require an external transformer, and can easily be installed by a homeowner. Wiring between lights can be buried directly in the ground
		






Line Voltage

			 These outdoor lights run on mains power, which is the same power that is inside your home (AC). They do not require an external transformer, but they are best left to professional installation, since they must pass electrical code inspection in most areas.

Why LED?



Energy Savings: LED is highly energy efficient using 75% less energy than conventional lighting
 Long Lasting: Lasts 25x longer than conventional lighting
Durability: Most stable light source available, resistant to vibrations and shocks

These fixtures are specially made with integrated LED lights. 
Keep in mind, any fixture with a standard base can become an LED light due to new bulb technologies. Decreasing prices are making this efficient technology affordable to everyone.

Light Direction



X
Light Direction

Adjustable Lighting

		 Adjustable Lighting allows for the fixture to be adjusted to alter the direction of light.
	


Ambient Lighting

		 Ambient Light is designed to splay light in all directions and is often used in foyer and dining room applications when a lot of light is needed.
	


Down Lighting

		 By far the most popular type of pendant, down lighting pendants direct light downwards by using open bottom shades to minimize the amount of light that is projected upwards towards the ceiling.
	




Up / Down Lighting

		 Up / Down Lighting fixtures are often open-ended drum shade pendants where minimal light is directed outwards but instead is directed both up and down.
	


Up Lighting

		 Uncommon in pendant lighting. Up lighting pendants use a shade to direct light towards the ceiling.

The Ribbon Light - a collaboration with MARK Product
Thursday 20 March, 2014



	We are excited to announce the return of the Ribbon Light. Tom designed the light exclusively for MARK Product, a design-led British furniture manufacture, back in 2008. Back by popular demand the pendant shade is available in sustainably sourced ash, oak or walnut.

	Since their origins in 2008 MARK Product have collaborated with some of the UK’s most innovative designers and have carefully developed a furniture range for the office, leisure, education and hospitality sectors as well as for use in the home. Their forward thinking collection reflects the company’s design and ethical values without compromising on style and beauty.



	Each large feature pendant has Tom’s unique signature of looping wood and was inspired by the low energy and ecological method of steam bending. “I was trying to create an organic form that was reflective of our work,” explains Tom. “I wanted to create a beautiful object when the light was off, whilst also omitting this beautiful light effect when turned on.”



	The Ribbon Light shade can be coupled with our favourite Plumen low energy light bulb which has a unique twisted and curled shape that enhances the overall look of the light. We also recommend that you add an E27 metal pendant set in white to the ash and oak variation, and the black for a contemporary look with the walnut shade.

    See all 7 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsShades of Light shining brightByAmazon Customeron October 21, 2012Format: MP3 Music|Verified PurchaseI'd never heard of Mark Baldwin until I picked up a free sample disc from McPherson Guitars,which had a couple songs on it from my favorite guitarist Phil Keaggy,.  I was pleasantly surprised to hear Baldwin's song "To the Sky" on it and instantly fell in love with it.  I was not disappointed when I purchased "Shades of Light" which "To the Sky" is on.  The whole song selection is marvelously diversified and shows off Baldwin's mastery of the fretboard and skill sets. I look forward to exploring his other  works soon.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Overall, I have used this product for two consecutive days and I can see an immense visible difference. Over the years I have tried so many different products and this one is amazing!!! Not only does it help with existing acne but it has made my skin appear and feel so much smoother!!! Thank you so much NEUTROGENA for creating such an amazing and worthwhile product that doesn't break the bank!!:)

        Amazing skin!!
I've been using this mask for a couple of weeks and it's amazing. I've stopped using foundation because I don't even need it anymore. Only con is that I suffer from migraines and wearing the mask causes me to get a migraine each time. Since I switched to a sleeping mask it's all been good. Results are definitely worth it.

I have only been using this product for 3 days and it already has shrunken the pimples that I had. I would definitely purchase the next 30 day supply.

        Visible shrinkage of pimples.
I was a little skeptical when I bought this product because some Neutrogena products break me out. I have only used it for 3 days so far, and already 3 pimples that were pronounced have shrunken and my complexion looks better. I am going to continue to use for the 30 days and if I like the results, I will continue to use it.

        Amazing results
I bought two, one for my son another for my nephew. After just 3 days of  proper use my son's face transformed. Other than, a few zits on his chin and one or two red spots between his eyebrows his face looks blemish free. We are so pleased. I can't wait to see if my nephemy had the same success rate.

        Love this mask!!!
I bought this three weeks ago and have been using it faithfully. I can say you can believe all the hype about this. It works. I haven't seen this clear of skin in a long time. 10 minutes a day and I am done. I do still get the occasional pimple here or there but no clusters, no painful bumps, and no flaking.  I love this so much I bought another activator and am thinking of buying the spot treatment. The only and I mean only drawback is the protective glasses. I have migraines. After the first treatment I had a migraine. The next time I used it I used an sleeping eye mask, no more migraines. That would be my only suggestion to improving the mask. Get a darker or thicker protective glasses. Dont let that stop you from using this. The worth is so much more than this one issue.

From the Inside Flap


Nonprofit high performance can be a challenge given the seven realities: limited time, imperfect knowledge, size of the board, composition of the board, fundability, continuity, and executive director inexperience. Not all organizations experience each of these realities at once, but it's a rare one that doesn't encounter a handful at the same time. Results Now® provides you with the tools to overcome these challenges, build capacity in your organization, achieve your nonprofit's mission, and sustain itself over the long term. Author and capacity-building expert Mark Light employs the revolutionary Results Now planning program to help your organization develop an integrated Results Now master plan to guide the work and mission of your nonprofit. Equally beneficial for organizations that are vitally strong or those that are in dire consequences, the master plan puts strategic, operating, and governance planning together under one comprehensive program. Recognizing that informed board members make better decisions, the guide utilizes ample accountability and performance measurements to gauge your success along the way. The flexible Results Now master plan was developed for simplicity: answer five questions about your organization, and in no time at all, you can develop a simple master plan that your company can put to immediate use, with plenty of room to refine it as you go along. It can be optimistic about where to go tomorrow while, at the same time, absolutely down-to-earth realistic about what gets done today. Results Now for Nonprofits reveals:   The four pillars of high performance: purpose, strategy, operations, and governance   The five essential questions that every organization must answer   What a well-constructed mission statement should address   The importance of measuring success to monitor performance, achieve meaningful results, and provide significant information for fundraising   Building high-performing nonprofits provides the capacity to develop, sustain, and ensure the delivery of your missionthe foundation for lasting social benefits. Discover the fast, easy way to bolster your nonprofit's performance with Results Now for Nonprofits.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA terrific investment that has translated into great resultsByJMcCarthyon June 27, 2011Format: HardcoverResults Now is an invaluable tool for successful non-profit management, governance, and cohesion between the volunteer board of directors and the professional staff of any non-profit organization. My organization is relatively small with an annual budget of just over $1 million and 13 full-time employees, serving a multi-county area in the Midwest. I was first introduced to the Results Now process back in late 2007, when my organization had the good fortune to hire Mark Light for a consultancy in which he introduced the board and the strategic managers on staff to the benefits of using Results Now to address the barriers encountered in our day-to-day work.The process is straight-forward, extensively well documented, and reliably flexible in its approach to ensuring successful management for non-profit organizations. Relying on the rule of "What you measure is what you get," Results Now has a strong bias for accountability, is focused on making sure that the job gets done, and that the organization accomplishes its mission by asking the questions Where to go tomorrow? What gets done today? Who does what? Did it happen? Perhaps most unique is that the process is a dynamic one that we have come to use and update as a regular part of day-to-day operations.More recently I had the privilege to participate in a cohort of local organizations who engaged with Dr. Light over a three month period looking at earned income possibilities through the Results Now process. Again, the Results Now experience was tremendous. The techniques expressed in Results Now have allowed me to strategically approach management of our existing lines of business while also growing the organization and introducing a new earned income venture that holds the promise of reducing our dependence upon government and private foundation grants.After four years of utilizing the Results Now process, I can personally vouch for its effectiveness, clarity and ease of use. My board of directors LOVES the way in which Results Now puts purpose, strategy, operations and governance into one comprehensive plan. Utilizing the process has enabled me and the board to focus on realizing our mission while maintaining our organization's values. Simply put - buy this book and use it. You'll be glad you did.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsDo yourself a favor....ByBill Hardyon December 5, 2012Format: Hardcover...and get this book! As CEO of a statewide nonprofit, I've read more than a few tomes on nonprofit governance and management, but none more helpful than Results Now for Nonprofits. I've had the added advantage of working with Mark Light directly in his capacity as a Results Now consultant. Like its author, the bookis straightforward, realistic and practical.  It is well-researched, efficient and insightful.  It hones in quickly and clearly on real-life nonprofit issues and solutions. Applying Results Now has increased our operations and governance.  I highly commend it.Read more0Comment|

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
