Based on an initial public offering price of $4.50 per share, we estimate that
the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting selling agent commissions
and expenses payable by us, will be approximately $4,249,413 if we sell a
minimum of 1,111,111 shares and approximately $13,498,240 if we sell all
3,333,333 shares of our common stock in this offering. A potential investor in
this offering should not that this is a best efforts offering and there is no
assurance that we will sell any shares or receive any proceeds.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to fund the cash portion of
the purchase price for the Target Assets and the businesses of the Target
Companies in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, and to repay indebtedness
in the aggregate amount of approximately $727,005 due to Ivy Equity Investors,
LLC, an affiliate of a member of our Board of Directors, Joseph Gamberale,
bearing interest at an annual rate of 6% and maturing on January 1, 2017. Such
indebtedness was incurred to finance the expenses of this offering as well as
for working capital. We will use the remaining proceeds of this offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes as indicated below.

The following table presents the principal intended uses of the net proceeds of
this offering in order of priority:

The foregoing presentation is based on reasonable estimates made by our
management; it should be noted, however, that, except with respect to the
purchase price for the Target Assets and the businesses of the Target Companies,
our management will have the discretion to allocate such net proceeds as it
determines. Further, the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including the cash used in or generated by our
operations, the pace of the integration of the Target Companies’ businesses, the
level of our sales and marketing activities and the attractiveness of any
additional acquisitions or investments. We believe that, in the event only the
minimum amount of this offering is completed, we will have sufficient proceeds
nonetheless to fund all of the uses described in the table above under
“Minimum”. If, however, we begin to experience an operating loss, we will be
required to fund that loss out of such proceeds. In such event, we will
reconsider our use of up to $225,000 for potential future business acquisitions
and reallocate such amount to working capital. Until we use the proceeds from
this offering as described above, we plan to invest such proceeds in highly
liquid short-term interest-bearing obligations, investment grade investments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S.
government.


The market for live and televised MMA events and for historical MMA video
content is extremely competitive.

The principal competitive factors in our industry include: 

· The ability to attract and retain successful professional fighters in order to
  promote events that are appealing to fans and sponsors.

· The ability to promote a large number of events and bouts so that fighters are
  willing to commit to multi-fight agreements. 

· The ability to command the attention of the UFC and other premier MMA 
  promotions seeking professional fighters to promote on a national and/or 
  international platform.

· The ability to produce high-quality media content on a consistent basis to 
  secure television and other media distribution arrangements. 

· The ability to generate brand awareness in the relevant geographic market. 

Despite the competition we face, we believe that our approach of combining
multiple regional MMA promotions under one umbrella organization enables us to
leverage the collective resources and relationships of these promotions to
address these competitive factors more effectively. In addition, our
multi-regional and, over time, international, presence will enable us to offer
sponsors and media outlets a broad geographic footprint in which to market
products, services and content.


Company Description
Alliance MMA, Inc. was formed to acquire the businesses of the Target Companies
and the media libraries of two prominent mixed martial arts, or MMA, promotions.
By combining the Target Companies, Alliance intends to create a developmental
league for professional MMA fighters and a feeder


 organization to the Ultimate
Fighting Championship, or the UFC, the sport’s largest mixed martial arts
promotion company featuring most of the top-ranked fighters in world. We also
intend to serve as a developmental organization for other premier MMA promotions
such as Bellator MMA. Under the Alliance MMA umbrella, we expect that our
regional MMA promotions will identify and cultivate the next generation of UFC
and other premier MMA promotion champions, while at the same time generating
live original media content, attracting an international fan base, and
generating sponsorship revenue for our live MMA events and professional
fighters.

The Target Companies comprise many of the leading regional MMA promotions in the
United States, with CFFC and Hoosier Fight Club ranked among the top 40 of all
regional MMA promotions internationally according to MMA industry site,
Sherdog.com. Collectively, the Target Companies have sent over 50 professional
MMA fighters to the UFC, have signed over 65 professional MMA fighters to
multi-fight contracts and, in 2015, conducted more than 50 professional MMA
events. We anticipate that the Target Companies’ promotions will conduct a total
of over 65 events in 2016 (pre- and post-acquisition) and approximately 90 in
2017. Many of these events are televised or streamed live on cable and network
stations. In 2015, the Target Companies on a collective basis generated $2.4
million in gross revenue and $0.127 million in net income. 

Our operations will be centered on the following three business components:

· Live MMA Event Promotion, which will consist of generating revenue from ticket
  sales and providing a foundation for national sponsorship and national and
  international media distribution for our live MMA events.

· MMA Content Distribution, which will consist of paid distribution of original
  content on television, cable networks, pay-per-view broadcasts, and over the
  Internet, in the United States and through international distribution  
  agreements. 

· Sponsorships and Promotions, which will consist of sponsorships for live MMA
  events and televised productions and related advertising and promotional 
  opportunities. 

In addition, we are evaluating the profitability of other revenue sources, such
as merchandising, ticketing, and fighter agency and management services.

PROMOTIONS









Atlantic City, New Jersey – Cage Fury has promoted over 60 professional MMA events, primarily in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and other venues in the Northeast region. Ranked in the top 10 of all regional MMA promotions, CFFC currently airs on the CBS Sports Network & iPPV and has sent more then 25 fighters to the UFC, including Aljamain Sterling, Jimmie Rivera, Lyman Good, and Paul Felder.CFFC’s former President Robert Haydak & Vice President Mike Constantino will serve as the Alliance MMA President and Director of Business Development, respectively, for the new corporate entity. The former Director of Fighter Relations Devon Mathiesen will serve as the new GM. Both Haydak and Constantino have each been inducted into the New Jersey State Martial Arts Hall of Fame. With more than 50 fighters under contract CFFC is scheduled to promote more than 12 events in a busy 2017.









Kirkland, Washington – Founded by Washington MMA pioneer Joe DeRobbio, COGA is a consensus leader in Mixed Martial Arts fighting in their region.After spending more than 13 years as a referee & advocate for fighter safety – DeRobbio has paired up with Jason Robinett to lead the Alliance effort in the Pacific Northwest Region.With more then 50 events over the last 7 years, COGA promises a bright future to any athlete that steps into their cage. They played host to stars such as Demetrius Johnson – who was their first bantamweight amateur champion before going Pro and eventually becoming the current UFC Champion with the longest running title defense streak ever. 









Miami, Florida -- Fight Time Promotions has been Florida’s best MMA promotion for the past seven years since being founded by Karla Guadamuz-Davis and her husband the late Olympic Boxing Gold Medalist Howard Davis Jr. The promotion has produced more than 30 events, many of which have been featured on the CBS Sports Network, Comcast SportsNet, Fox Sports, and HBO Plus. Their extensive roster of over 80 fighters under contract will help grow a pool of athletes and further extend Alliance MMA’s geographically friendly platform in the key market of South Florida.Mrs. Guadamuz-Davis is carrying on her late-husband’s legacy as a pioneer of combat sports by giving developing fighters the opportunity to showcase their talents on a stage that is now even larger under the Alliance MMA umbrella.









Valparaiso, Indiana – After finding success in the pageant world, former Mrs. Indiana winner Danielle Vale and her husband Paul felt drawn to the sport of MMA. They ended up creating Hoosier Fight Club, with the intent to bring the spotlight and professionalism to the sport they thought it deserved.Promoting the first sanctioned Mixed-Martial-Arts event in the state of Indiana, HFC is considered by many in Chicagoland to be the established leader of the local MMA scene.With over 25 events under their belt and new deals across the midwest, HFC will continue to bring a highlight to the sport and send athletes to the big show – like UFC veterans Neil Magny, Felice Herrig and more.









Baltimore, Maryland – The brain-child of John Rallo, Shogun fights regularly packs one of the biggest regional MMA venues – the Royal Farms Arena with some of the best MMA shows in the Mid-Atlantic region.With a successful (albeit short) MMA career and stint as a celebrity bodyguard under his belt, Rallo focused on opening a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy after receiving his blackbelt from Renzo Gracie himself. During this time he worked towards legalizing MMA in the state of Maryland, eventually passing legalization in one session – an unheard of feat with new legislature.With the arena wide-open, Rallo has spent the last few years promoting shows and building a roster of packed talent, with several fighters going to the UFC. A hotbed for celebrities and UFC stars, Shogun events will continue to be a Baltimore mainstay for time to come.









Bellefontaine, Ohio – founded by Scott Sheeley, Iron Tiger Fight Series currently hosts approximately ten MMA promotions per year in various cities throughout the Ohio region. Since launching its inaugural event, IT Fight Series has promoted more than a dozen fighters who went on to compete at the highest level of professional MMA competition with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Bellator and other premier promotions.Names like Matt “The Immortal” Brown, Dan “Dragon” Spohn, and Jan “Cuddles” Finney all fought for Scott Sheely promotions as a means of catapulting themselves to the big show.









Memphis, Tennessee – What began as a lobbying effort alongside UFC superstar “Rampage” Jackson, V3Fight’s Nick Harmier’s efforts in the sport didn’t just end with the sanctioning of MMA – it culminated into a regional MMA promotion blazing it’s way through the South.Currently in 6 different venues in their area, V3Fights is another one of the fastest growing regional promotions in America. 









Atlanta, Georgia - National Fighting Championship (NFC) was founded by David Oblas in 2007 after a rebrand of his organization Undisputed Productions, LLC stemming from the acquisition of US Freedom Fighter Championship (USFFC). Oblas is both the youngest promotor in the history of fight promotion in Georgia and the longest running promotor in the state.Going back to their days as Undisputed Promotions LLC, Oblas and his crew have promoted of more than 100 events at a number of venues in Atlanta. They currently produce regional MMA events at Center Stage in Atlanta, Infinite Energy Arena in Duluth, GA, Electric Cowboy in Kennesaw, GA, and the TD Convention Center in Greenville, SC. NFC is the 9th regional MMA promotion operating under the Alliance umbrella and will serve as a perfect fit for tapping into one of the major media markets that Alliance MMA has been targeting.









Los Angeles, California - Roy Englebrecht Promotions promotes the Fight Club OC fight series at The Hangar on the grounds of the OC Fair & Event Center now in its seventh season and on a three-year sellout streak. Prior to the formation of Fight Club OC in 2011 he promoted the highly successful Battle in the Ballroom professional boxing shows at the Irvine Marriott Hotel for 25 straight years. This bi-monthly professional boxing show was the longest running club pro boxing show in the country. 36 current or former world champions have fought at the Marriott, including Shane Mosley and Johnny Tapia.In 2007 he became one of the first boxing promoters to introduce Mixed Martial Arts shows to his Battle in the Ballroom concept. With the addition of the Rumble On The Water series at the historic Queen Mary in Long Beach, CA and the Coliseum Gladiator MMA Championship Series at the LA Coliseum Roy Englebrecht Promotions will promote close to 20 shows in 2017, more than any other promoter in the state of California.

Alliance MMA is the first publicly-traded Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) company. AMMA has a first mover advantage, bringing together top local and regional MMA promotions (events) in the US.
                          
The Company completed its NASDAQ IPO in October 2016 and raised approximately $10 million from the IPO, selling a total of 2.2 million shares, and forming the largest group of regional MMA promotions in the US.
                          
Since its inception, the Company has acquired nine MMA organizations and added existing MMA business support units, such as SuckerPunch, Alliance Sports Media, and CageTix. Operating as a centralized management organization, AMMA applies industry best practices to maximizes profitability.  Headquartered in New York, AMMA currently operates promotions in ten of the top 20 major media markets cities and plans to expand into 20 cities nationally by the end of 2017. The expanding national footprint will allow the company to increase its viewership, number of events, customer base, number of contracted fighters, and sponsorship deals; thus, increasing the overall revenue run rate.
                          

Figure 1: Mixed Martial Arts 

                            The Company’s core mission is to identify and cultivate the next generation of fighters and champions for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and other MMA promotions. It provides a platform to fighters between the ages of 18-34  as the go to brand for those seeking the “College Hoops” of MMA and ultimately providing them a platform to reach their true potential and advance to the sport’s highest level of professional MMA competition.
                           
Mixed Martial Arts is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) was an MMA fight club purchased by casino moguls Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta. Over a period of 15 years, the Fertitta brothers grew the club into a $4.2 billion sports empire. The closest competitor to UFC, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), is valued at $1.5 billion. UFC generated about $600 million in revenue in FY15 and signed a $700 million, seven-year broadcasting deal signed with FOX.
                           
MMA events bring celebrities, high rollers, and rabid fans into an arena much like a gladiator event. Typical UFC events have a seating capacity of between 15,000-20,000. UFC draws its revenue from various sources including ticketing, TV advertisements, sponsorships, and other celebrity deals.
                          

Figure 2: UFC Fighters in Action 
In mid-2016, the Fertitta brothers sold UFC for a staggering $4.2 billion, cashing out for a significant ROI (they bought the club out of bankruptcy for $2 million in 2001). UFC has viewership in more than 150 countries around the globe, reaching 1.1 billion households. UFC stages an average of 40 events each year across the US, with approximately 550 fighters participating.
                          
AMMA’s business model is similar to UFC’s model. Long-term, AMMA has the potential to generate rapid revenue growth with its events operating in regional markets across the United States, in addition to the international expansion. The Company’s near-term strategy is to acquire or create regional MMA promotions in top 20 media markets across the U.S. It will target high-revenue opportunities with proven marketing and audience reach. As the Company expands its national footprint it will seek to secure high-value sponsorship agreements with prominent consumer brands.
                          
AMMA’s management acts as an umbrella over its regional events which are managed locally. Also, by targeting young aspiring MMA fighters in regional markets who strive to make it to the UFC and other top-tier MMA promotions, AMMA has a significant opportunity to showcase future fighters to fighter management firms and managers; thus, providing a source for in-house talent development that will reap ongoing benefits.
                         
AMMA generated $755,000 in revenue in 1Q17; Gross profit margin was 38%. AMMA grew revenue 28% QoQ in 1Q17 and produced a total of 13 regional MMA promotions. The Company has demonstrated the ability to produce high gross margins (38% in 1Q17) and we believe margins will continue to improve going forward, driven primarily by lower relative costs as they achieve business efficiencies with further benefit from the addition of new events and increased ticket sales
                         
During the first quarter, the Company continued to incur expenses related to building out the necessary infrastructure to support future growth, including recruiting key executives and support personnel staff.
                         
 The Company has multiple potential sources of revenue:
                           
Regional MMA Events
Media Distribution
National Sponsorships
Fighter Management

Regional MMA events generate revenue via ticket sales, venue fees from casinos and local and regional sponsorship agreements. This also may include revenue from food, beverage, merchandise sales and ticket services such as CageTix.
                           
CageTix is an electronic ticking platform that focuses specifically on Mixed Martial Arts. This service allows consumers to target a specific athlete in an MMA promotion and award that athlete with a percentage of the ticket sale; consumers can put money directly into the pocket of the fighter. Since its inception, CageTix has been used in 1,200 MMA events and currently services 64 MMA promotions, operating in 106 cities. In 2014, CageTix sold over 15,883 tickets to 6,291 customers. The acquisition of CageTix will further accelerate revenue growth for AMMA.
                           
Media Distribution revenue is generated from monetization of events through broadcast television advertising, internet streaming pay-per-view fees, distribution and licensing of content.

Fighter Management revenue is earned from fighter purse commissions at the completion of events. This also includes third-party pay-per-view sales, personal brand sponsorships, and other ancillary activities. Also, the acquisition of SuckerPunch provides the company with significant fighter management revenue. SuckerPunch has 100+ fighters under contract, and approximately dozen of its fighters have are fighting at the UFC level.
                         
The Company emphasizes the importance of General Managers (GMs) for each of promotions. GMs are responsible for business development, matchmaking fighters, regulatory compliance with local and state commissioners, venue selection, fighter relations, and regional sponsorship deals.
                         

Figure 3: AMMA Fighters in Action  
AMMA plans to pursue opportunities in Asia, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Central and South America. Scott Sheeley, the former owner of Iron Tiger Fight Series, will lead the expansion into new international markets.
                         
AMMA’s near-term goal is to secure 20 regional MMA promotion markets by the end of FY17. Long-term the company aims to host more than 125 events per year, with more than 1,000 contracted fighters. We believe that the company will have made substantial progress into international markets, securing major brand sponsorship revenue for live MMA events, digital media and Alliance MMA fighters by the end of FY18.
                         
AMMA’s acquisitions are high profile MMA brands that have a solid fan base and great management. Each of the Company’s acquisitions are high profile MMA brands that have a solid fan base and great management. This provides the Company with necessary cash flows to continue its business expansion.  Some highlights on its acquisitions:
                         
Cage Fury Fighting Championship (CFFC) operates in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It is ranked in the top 10 of all regional MMA brands and has promoted over 60 professional MMA events. It currently airs on CBS Sport Network & PPV and has sent more than 25 fighters to the UFC, including Aljamain Sterling, Jimmie Rivera, Lyman Good, and Paul Felder.
                         

Figure 4: Cage Fury Fighting Championship(CFFC) 65, May 20, 2017 
Combat Games (COGA) operates in Washington and is the MMA leader in the Pacific Northwest. It has promoted over 50 events in the last seven years and played host to stars such as Demetrius Johnson, their first bantamweight amateur champion who turned pro, becoming the UFC Champion with the longest running title-defense streak ever.
                        
Fight Time Promotions has been Florida’s best MMA brand for seven years. They’ve produced over 35 events and have been telecasted on CBS Sports Network, Comcast Sports Net and HBO Plus. They currently have over 80 fighters under contract.
                        
Hosier Fight Club (HFC)  is the first sanctioned MMA event in the state of Indiana, just outside of Chicago. With over 25 events under its belt, HFC is considered by many in the Midwest to be the established leader of the local MMA scene. In addition, HFC attracts high profile UFC veterans such as Neil Magny, Felice Herrig and many more to its MMA events.
                        
AMMA’s other brands also have incredible fan following and history. Together, these ten high-performing MMA brands provide AMMA with a solid base of predictable revenue with events scheduled year-round.
                        
AMMA is on road to generate record revenue in FY17. The Company completed 13 events during 1Q2017 and has at least 50 additional events scheduled for the remainder of FY17. AMMA has recently announced the planned acquisition through Letter of Intent to acquire an additional promotion in Los Angeles. With addition of this promotions, the number of events will increase and we anticipate strong revenue growth in FY17 with further acceleration in FY18.
                        

Table 2: Potential AMMA Events
 View Full Image
AMMA is a stepping stone for the next generation of fighters and champions for the UFC and other premier MMA promotions. The Company provides a platform for fighters to showcase their skills in the hopes of becoming the next generation of fighters in UFC and other premier MMA promotions. Most recently, AMM fighters, Brian Kelleher and Jared Gordon joined the ranks of the UFC, and after Max “Blessed” Holloway’s triumph at UFC 212 in Rio De Janeiro, he is now the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s (UFC) undisputed World Featherweight Champion. With his victory Saturday night, Holloway joins Germaine de Randamie, current UFC female World Featherweight Champion, as SuckerPunch Entertainment’s second reigning UFC Champion. AMMA’s whole-owned subsidiary SuckerPunch has a history of sending fighters to UFC events.  More and more fighters see AMMA as the best way to reach their ultimate destination: the UFC.
                        
Company’s management team has extensive industry experience with major MMA brands. AMMA’s president, Robert Haydak, successfully led top ranked regional MMA promotion, Cage Fighting Championships. Prior experience as a founder/CEO of two highly successful ventures and 28 years of experience in the industry, Haydak provides AMMA with a formidable foundation in all aspects of business operations.
                        
The Company’s chief marketing officer, James Byrne, is a veteran of arena sports marketing, creating media opportunities, joint ventures and marketing partnerships. Byrne was a senior marketing executive for Ultimate Fighting Championship, World Wrestling Entertainment and Glory Kickboxing, and brings 38 years of industry experience.
                        
Recently, AMMA promoted Burt Watson to Executive Vice president of Operations. Burt brings his well-seasoned MMA promotional experience and extraordinary leadership skills to the Company. Mr. Watson began his career in boxing more than 30 years ago coordinating events that involved boxing stars Mike Tyson, Oscar De La Hoya, Roy Jones etc. Prior to joining Alliance MMA, Mr. Watson was the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) Event Coordinator for 14 years. Throughout his illustrious career, Mr. Watson was responsible for coordinating televised sporting events featured on numerous networks including ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, HBO, Showtime, USA, BET and Telemundo.
                        
Major MMA brand experience provides the Company with valuable expertise to drive the Company’s growth in a large market opportunity
                        
Valuation 
We are valuing AMMA using a 4.0x P/S multiple applied to our 2019 sales estimate of $16.0 million, generating a target price of $3.70. A 4.0x P/S multiple values AMMA at a steep discount to UFC, which was valued at 6.7x sales at the time of its acquisition in 2015.  We believe a discount is appropriate given that AMMA is at the earlier stage in the MMA space than UFC, the dominant brand globally.
                        
Some notes on our model:
                              
We are projecting AMMA to generate revenue of $4.1 million in FY17, $8.8 million in FY18, and $16.7 million in FY19. We have projected AMMA to have a QoQ growth between 22%-30%
We believe that the company’s organic marketing reach and sponsorship deals will significantly increase revenue growth in FY18 and FY19 and AMMA’s market penetration rate will begin to increase significantly between 2H18-1H19.
We assume that the company will raise equity in FY17, FY18 and FY19 to finance operations and acquisitions. We believe that management may turn to alternative financing for additional capital to finance acquisitions. 
Our projections are based on optimistic assumptions that the company will expand to 20 regional MMA promotions by the end of FY17, significant progress into international expansion by the end of FY18 and continued expansion globally in FY19.

RISKS

AMMA’s business represents a new business model in the MMA industry. The Company has limited operating history and the company’s business strategy may not successfully address risks and uncertainties that the business might face and could adversely affect the overall success and/or delay profitability.
                           

There are substantial doubts about AMMA’s ability to continue to run its business operations. Due to the Company’s business expansion and usage of capital, the Company lacks sufficient cash flows to finance operations and acquisitions. The Company may not be able to continue its business operations without raising capital. Failure to complete a capital raise would likely slow the Company’s expected growth.
                           

AMMA’s business expansion could be affected by other successful MMA promotions. The Company is not a direct competitor to successful MMA promotions like UFC that operate in the industry. However, these successful MMA promotions could adversely impact AMMA’s business strategy and expansion with significant usage of their greater resources.
                           

Company may not be able to attract promotional and advertising sponsorships. AMMA’s business strategy includes developing national sponsorship agreements with regional and national consumer brands to increase its audience and overall profitability. If the Company is unable to attract promotional and advertising sponsorships, AMMA’s operating results will be adversely affected.
                           

Potential class action lawsuit. A class action lawsuit against the company seeks damages on behalf of shareholders who participated in the Company’s initial public offering (IPO) on October 6, 2016.  The lead plaintiff motion deadline is on June 16, 2017.

Their extensive roster of over 80 fighters under contract will help grow a pool of athletes and further extend Alliance MMA’s geographically friendly platform in the key market of South Florida.Mrs. Guadamuz-Davis is carrying on her late-husband’s legacy as a pioneer of combat sports by giving developing fighters the opportunity to showcase their talents on a stage that is now even larger under the Alliance MMA umbrella.

Baltimore, Maryland – The brain-child of John Rallo, Shogun fights regularly packs one of the biggest regional MMA venues – the Royal Farms Arena with some of the best MMA shows in the Mid-Atlantic region.With a successful (albeit short) MMA career and stint as a celebrity bodyguard under his belt, Rallo focused on opening a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Academy after receiving his blackbelt from Renzo Gracie himself. During this time he worked towards legalizing MMA in the state of Maryland, eventually passing legalization in one session – an unheard of feat with new legislature.With the arena wide-open, Rallo has spent the last few years promoting shows and building a roster of packed talent, with several fighters going to the UFC.
