There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsWay Over the TopByJack Sparacinoon October 26, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseSpectacular is the first and last word that comes to mind in thinking about this gloriously told story.  While the opening pages come near to bogging down in seemingly endless detail about Lewis and Clark's preparation for their monumental voyage and the various supplies they laid in, the trip itself is described in breathtakingly brilliant, gripping prose.  No wonder history courses seldom receive high marks-- teachers are ill equipped to share the adrenaline soaring adventures of our many real life American heroes.  Lewis and Clark were U.S. Army commanders of the highest caliber.  They focused on their men and their nearly impossible mission in equal measure.  Their bravery and intelligence under often horrific conditions-- cold, wet, blizzards, not enough to eat, sometimes hostile Indians, and on and on-- ultimately carried the day and lit one more candle or torch for their famous, one of a kind leader and mentor, President Jefferson and our still new nation.Lewis's unraveling and acute illness when he assumed a political post after the expedition was over is heart breaking.  He became terribly ill, ultimately committing suicide while still in his 30's, and there didn't seem to be anyone available to help him.  Or, of course, the sort of medications routinely available to modern day physicians.  Despite his ignominious and terrible slide toward death by his own hand, Meriwether Lewis stands with his great friend William Clark as one of the best men our armed forces ever saw.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsStephen Ambrose almost makes the reader feel like she/he is there while all the decisions are being ...ByBrad Pattenon July 24, 2015Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseI thought I had some modicum of understanding of the famous trek west by these two historic icons until I read " Undaunted Courage ". Stephen Ambrose almost makes the reader feel like she/he is there while all the decisions are being made and our Congress of the day debates funding the trip as well as approving the funds for the Louisiana Purchase which they thought would be a bust. Congress? some things don't change.. Beyond that, the summary of the trip preparation and the actual trip itself is fascinating. How so few men could achieve what they did, when they did it in an unknown land filled with dangerous marauding natives may be one of the single greatest American achievements ever. Kudos to Stephen Ambrose and kudos to Thomas Jefferson for insisting the Lewis and Clark sojourn take place. This is a great read for anyone interested in substantive American history and the American spirit to accept and overcome formidable challenges..0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsAnother easy reading book by Stephen AmbroseByEdmondon August 17, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseAs someone who has recently been fascinated by the Expedition, I found this book to be an incredibly easy read.  The pages flew by and flowed together very well.  In my opinion, the book was somewhat slow in the beginning but that was probably more me than the book as I was more interested in the Expedition itself than the early life of Meriwether Lewis.This book puts into perspective how difficult the trip was and how even with modern technology, this trip would've still been difficult.  I learned a few things such as what a sextant is.  It was interesting to read Lewis's descriptions of the Native Americans describing them as savages while also admiring them.  I think a lot of history books gloss over the Expedition with only minor details.  It was interesting to learn of his fight against the Blackfeet as well as the medical issues endured by the men via the weather and also medical conditions brought on by themselves through intercourse with Native American women.We also see a glimpse into the tight relationship between Lewis and Clark.  Lewis was very much a scientist and reading about what wildlife he saw as the first American to do so was really cool.  With some locations, Ambrose frequently tells us around where the present day location is and being a Google Maps lover, I would look it up.  It was fascinating to see places where I could visit myself that Lewis and Clark had visited.In all, I can see myself coming back to this book to read again.I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read it but it was also sad to read of the battle Lewis had with alcoholism and malaria(?)0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Hansonon June 18, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseNormally, I'm not one to read much nonfiction, but my sister recommended that I read this book, because it is among her favorite books. I called her tonight, after I finished reading chapter 39, genuinely distraught, because I didn't know Lewis's life ended in that way, plus I was in awe by how eloquently that chapter was written, describing what was possibly going through Lewis's mind before his death. Thanks so much to my sister for the recommendation, who recommends that I read Clay Jenkinson next and listen to his "Jefferson Hour" podcast.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsA True Adventure Story.Bycrowwomanon June 16, 2015Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is a wonderful "travelogue" of the Lewis and Clark expedition, focusing on the life of Meriwether Lewis. Ambrose emphasizes the close friendship that Lewis shared with both Thomas Jefferson and with William Clark. The book is a good history and, for the most part, Ambrose stays away from politicizing the subject matter. The first few chapters were a bit dry, but once I got to Lewis' relationship with Jefferson, I found myself not wanting to put it down.The Lewis and Clark expedition was one of the great adventures of all times and is not something that will be duplicated on this planet. We know now what lies around the next turn. They were the ones who drew the map ... and the details of how they took measurements and produced the map were given in a way that made sense to me, a nonmathmatical thinker. As often as he can, Ambrose allows Lewis to tell his own story in his own words, and what a wordsmith he really was. His prose is beautiful. I was truly sorry that his journals were as sparse as they were and that he never managed to get them edited and printed in his lifetime.Lewis' story is truly tragic. His whole life seemed to point to the expedition, and when the trip was over, he never really found his way again. I have a much greater respect for life on the early frontier. I have recommended this book to several others, and had I not bought it on my Kindle, I would probably have it out on semi permanent loan.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsWonderful, Timeless Story - Well WrittenBySteve DietrichVINE VOICEon January 7, 2007Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseAmbrose brings the magic of the Lewis & Clark expedition alive with this magnificent book.A great author can struggle with a pedestrian story and a great story be tarnished  by an unskilled author. However, Undaunted Courage is the re-telling of a classic story from the heart of America by a great author who also loves and lives the material. There are so many mini-stories woven into the book that it helps to stimulate entertaining discussions of this historic accomplishment.The book also brought to me a far greater appreciation of Jefferson's great impact on art and science in the young republic. While we think of thte expedition in terms of its impact on our political history, it was equally important in gaining an understanding of the biological and geographical wonders of the uncharted wilderness.It is a wonderful gift to young people to help them understand the foundation of our westward growth.  Reads with the excitement of a novel and the enlightenment of  good history.It is hard not to repeat the many good things said about this book other than to mention that if I were to be allowed only 5 books to take for a year of isolation this would be one.It's easy, but rewarding reading.Highly recommended and a book that's filled a lot of Christmas stockings and birthday packages in our family.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA historic adventureBydennis michaelon August 21, 2014Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseThis is an actual historical event that Ambrose brings to life in the form of an adventure story; it's not a dry history lesson. It starts a bit slow with the early lives of Jefferson, Lewis and Clark, but becomes an adventure in the wilderness.I think the most remarkable character is Sakajawea, their guide and interpreter. She went on the trail pregnant, gave birth in the field, then carried the baby on her back.Another remarkable aspect of the expedition is that for the entire treacherous journey, only one man was lost; this attests to the excellent leadership of Lewis and Clarke.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREPlotinus: Myth, Metaphor, And Philosophical Practiceby Clark, Stephen R. L.The thought of the Roman philosopher, Plotinus (c205-70), has been the object of perennial fascination for philosophers and laymen alike. Best known today for his doctrine of self-transformation through contemplation, Plotinus did not regard his originality as formulating new truths but rather as showing how to engage in spiritual exercises so as to live philosophically.&nbsp; Taking a highly unconventional approach, the distinguished philosopher Stephen R. L. Clark here gives us a book that is at once deeply penetrating and highly personal. Clark focuses on dimensions of Plotinus that scholars have dismissed as irrelevant or merely  ornamental : his images, metaphors, and myths. He argues that we need to understand those dimensions in the cultural and philosophical context of his time if we are to understand what those exercises amount to, and so to understand, as it were from within, where his philosophy leads. Clark shows how Plotinus employs specific images drawn from the Greek literary tradition for philosophical purposes: images of knowledge like those of light or drunkenness; or images of being itself in order to analyze and explore the realities of the Divine Intellect. He also notes their momentous legacy in later thinkers in the Muslim, Jewish, and Christian traditions. The book aims to be both scholarly and open to psychotherapeutic discussions from within other philosophical and psychiatric traditions that acknowledge the role that stories, myths, and metaphors play in constructing the mind.Ancient & ClassicalCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
