Edgar M. Cullman Sr., a cigar maker who worked to broaden the appeal of his product in the late 20th century, helping transform its public image from an unwieldy mobster’s appendage to a cool and slim object of desire, died on Sunday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 93.His son, Edgar Jr., confirmed his death.The elder Mr. Cullman was the longtime president, chairman and chief executive of the General Cigar Company, a leading manufacturer that over the years produced some of the country’s most ubiquitous cigars, including inexpensive and midpriced brands like White Owl, Tiparillo and Tijuana Smalls, and higher-priced ones like Macanudo, which has long been among the country’s best-selling premium cigars.The Cullman family, known for its multigenerational tobacco interests, was involved with General Cigar from the early 1960s until 2005, when the company was sold to Swedish Match, a maker of snuff and other tobacco products. That year, General Cigar reported sales of more than $170 million, according to Culbro, which was General Cigar’s corporate parent from the 1970s to the 1990s. (Culbro is today the family’s private equity company.)Edgar Meyer Cullman was born on Jan. 7, 1918, and, as a company publicist told Business Week in 1968, was “diapered in tobacco leaf.” His great-grandfather Ferdinand Kullman was a wine and tobacco merchant from Germany who settled in the United States in the 1840s. Ferdinand’s sons, Joseph and Jacob, founded Cullman Brothers, a tobacco brokerage house, in 1892.

Edgar’s father, Joseph Jr., was an importer and grower who acquired swaths of land in the Connecticut River Valley, where much of the tobacco for cigar wrappers is grown. His father also acquired the controlling interest in the cigarette maker Benson & Hedges before selling the company to Philip Morris in the 1950s. Continue reading the main story

Edgar’s brother, Joseph III, a longtime chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris who died in 2004, steered that company to immense profitability, presiding over its well-known advertising campaign, “Come to Marlboro Country.”Edgar Cullman earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Yale in 1940 and afterward expressed a desire to join the family business. His father secured him an apprenticeship at H. Anton Bock, a cigar maker on Second Avenue in Manhattan. There, young Mr. Cullman learned to sort and roll tobacco, making cigar after cigar by hand at his workbench.In 1961, Edgar Cullman and a group of investors bought the controlling interest in General Cigar for about $25 million. Based in New York, the company was then the country’s second-largest producer in terms of sales; its brands included White Owl, Wm. Penn, Van Dyck and Robert Burns.

Mr. Cullman was elected president and chief executive at the end of 1962. In 1963, General Cigar sold about $70 million in cigars, for about 11 percent of the market; by 1967, Business Week reported the next year, the company’s revenue — not all from cigars — was $220 million.Mr. Cullman entered the field at a propitious time. Postwar cigar makers had begun seeking to transform the image of their product from Edward G. Robinson gangsterism to Steve McQueen cool. They sought in particular to attract young smokers, who had long gravitated to cigarettes.The surgeon general’s report of 1964, which established a link between cigarette smoking and several serious illnesses, was the saving grace cigar makers were looking for, propelling many cigarette smokers toward cigars for the first time. (Cigar smoking was later shown to have its own associated health risks, including cancers of the mouth.)

Mr. Cullman enthusiastically capitalized on this exodus with smaller and milder cigars, including Tijuana Smalls, introduced in 1970. Designed to feel more like cigarettes in the hand and mouth, they were specifically aimed at a young market.Under Mr. Cullman’s stewardship, General Cigar also diversified its holdings to include the Bachman line of snack foods, Ex-Lax, packaging companies and real estate. The company’s name was changed to Culbro in 1976.

Mr. Cullman stepped down as Culbro’s president in 1981, but remained chief executive for another decade and a half and chairman until the company’s sale in 2005.In 1996, Culbro opened Club Macanudo, an upscale cigar club and restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.Mr. Cullman, who also had homes in Manhattan; Jamaica, West Indies; and New Brunswick, Canada, is survived by his wife of 73 years, the former Louise Bloomingdale, of the department-store family; his son Edgar Jr., who was later president of General Cigar; two daughters, Lucy Danziger and Susan Cullman; a brother, the financier Lewis B. Cullman, who is often described as the father of the leveraged buyout; six grandchildren and three step-grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.Mr. Cullman, who enjoyed good cigars in general and, his son said, Macanudos in particular, came to cigar smoking rather late, all things considered.“My grandfather bribed me that if I didn’t smoke or drink by 21, he would buy me a car,” Edgar Cullman told Cigar Aficionado magazine in 1994. “He died when I was 20. I never got the car.”

Edgar M. Cullman Sr. Is Dead at 93; Helped Make Cigars a Style Statement

Edgar Cullman, Jr. - Culbro























































 Our Team 

 

Edgar Cullman, Jr.
Managing Member
During his more than thirty years in operating roles at General Cigar and Culbro Corporation, Edgar M. Cullman Jr. faced both favorable and unfavorable business conditions and learned how to lead in both those circumstances.
For instance, in his early career, the cigar industry began a slow decline that lasted nearly 20 years, while in his later years the cigar industry had a tremendous revival. During this time, he not only took a hands-on approach to General Cigar but also helped lead the company into other diversified businesses. Mr. Cullman’s unusual operating experience adds exceptional value to his role as a managing member of Culbro, LLC.
Mr. Cullman joined General Cigar in 1974 after spending time in the US Army and as a management trainee for Manufacturers Hanover Bank. Like his father, he believed strongly in the importance of learning the tobacco business from the ground-up and began his career working in Puerto Rico, where the company sorted Connecticut wrapper, and Hartford, Connecticut where this wrapper is grown. Later he learned cigar manufacturing at the company’s operations in Kingston, Jamaica, Tampa, Florida and Philipsburg, Pennsylvania.
After absorbing all aspects of the cigar and tobacco business, including marketing and sales, Mr. Cullman rose to president of General Cigar in 1980 and subsequently to president of Culbro Corporation, the corporate parent of General Cigar, in 1984. Mr. Cullman became CEO of Culbro Corporation in 1996.
Mr. Cullman is on the boards of Mount Sinai Hospital, the visiting committee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brain Trauma Foundation, the Atlantic Salmon Federation and the Yale University Council.
He is a graduate of the Hotchkiss School (’64) and Yale University (’68).

Edgar
 M. Cullman, the man who led General Cigar Co. for decades and made 
Macanudo one of the best-selling brands in the history of the premium 
cigar business, died yesterday afternoon. He was 93 years old. He passed
 at his home in Connecticut surrounded by his loved ones."Edgar
 Sr. was a giant and a visionary. A legend for more than 45 years in 
America's premium cigar industry," said Marvin R. Shanken, editor and 
publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine. "This is a sad day."
Cullman,
 who was known as "Sr." to many in the cigar business, had a long, 
storied list of industry achievements. He was the chief executive 
officer of General Cigar and Culbro Corp. during the 1970s and 1990s, 
and shaped General Cigar into one of the world's largest producers of 
premium cigars, building Macanudo into a global powerhouse. He 
negotiated a deal for the U.S. rights to the Partagas cigar brand, 
bought Villazon & Co. (makers of Punch and Hoyo de Monterrey), and 
was among the pioneers in advertising cigars. At one point his company 
owned premium cigar factories in Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and 
Honduras. Cullman loved the cigar business, and was particularly proud 
of the rounded style of head General Cigar became known for, a type of 
construction he dubbed "the Cullman cap." He is also a member of Cigar Aficionado's Hall of Fame.
"He was an incredible man and gentleman,” said Dan Carr, president of General Cigar. “He had a large space in his heart for our industry, the people within it, and all those that enjoyed a fine cigar. It was an honor for me to know him, and learn from him. He will surely be missed for a long time by so many people.”
Cullman's
 great grandfather was a tobacco dealer in Germany. He immigrated to the
 United States. Cullman's father, born in the United States, bought 
tobacco from around the U.S. and the world. "Dad started in the tobacco 
business buying Havana seed, Connecticut broadleaf, some Cuban 
tobacco—actually very little—and tobacco in Wisconsin and Ohio," Cullman
 told Cigar Aficionado
 during a wide-ranging interview that appeared in the Autumn 1994 issue 
of the magazine. "He also imported Sumatra tobacco from the Dutch East 
Indies. He would go to the auctions in Amsterdam for the wrapper tobacco
 from Indonesia."
At one point Culbro Corp., the Cullman family company 
that later became the parent company of General Cigar, grew 1,800 acres 
of cigar tobacco in Connecticut, far more than is grown in the entire 
valley today. Cullman's brother Joseph Cullman III was the chairman of 
Philip Morris from 1967 to 1978. Cullman's son Edgar Cullman Jr. worked 
alongside his father at General Cigar Co.
A
 veteran of the Second World War, Cullman learned how to roll cigars in 
New York City in 1944 at H. Anton Bock, a cigar company located at 
Second Avenue between 65 and 66 Streets. "I would go there at 6 a.m. and
 set up at the bench. First, I learned how to sort the tobacco, how to 
shake the tobacco, the Cuban tobacco that came in, how to open up the 
bales, how to then case [moisten] the tobacco so you could use it. How 
to count the leaves. Then I had to sit down at a bench and learn how to 
roll a cigar," he said to Cigar Aficionado in 1994. "I never made money 
or my living out of that, but I learned how to roll."
In
 1961, Cullman and a group of investors purchased General Cigar Co. for 
around $25 million. At the time General made inexpensive cigars selling 
for nickels and dimes: White Owl, William Penn, Van Dyck and Robert 
Burns, among other brands. In 1969, Culllman bought the Temple Hall 
cigar factory in Jamaica. "It was a very small factory, very 
unimportant. They made Creme de Jamaica," Cullman said in 1994. It also 
owned a tiny brand called Macanudo.
General
 Cigar created a new blend for Macanudo, coming up with a well-aged 
Connecticut-shade wrapper, a mild mix of filler and binder, and got the 
cigars into top restaurants and began to promote the product in the 
1970s. "We started to advertise Macanudo very strongly," said Cullman. 
The slogan called Macanudo "The Ultimate Cigar." It worked, and sales 
took off. Macanudo was the largest cigar brand sold in America before 
the debut of Cigar Aficionado magazine, and sales only got stronger after the magazine was published. At 
one point during the cigar boom, General had to temporarily stop making 
Macanudos due to shortages of the aged tobacco needed to make the 
cigars. They couldn't make enough.
Cullman's
 storied history with General Cigar began to end in 1999 when General 
Cigar sold its mass-market cigar business to Swedish Match AB. In 2000, Swedish Match acquired a controlling 
interest in General Cigar and in 2005 it bought out the remaining shares in the company, which put an end 
to Cullman's management of General. He never completely severed ties
 to the industry he loved so dear, however, and had a cigar made in his 
name.
A graduate of Yale, Cullman served on the Yale Development Board, and 
loved his Yale football games. He enjoyed games of tennis and fishing for 
salmon. He was a trustee of the Mount Sinai Medical Center, the Hotchkiss School, served on the boards of Bloomingdale Properties Inc. and Griffin
 Land & Nurseries Inc., and was a director on many corporate boards,
 including Mutual of Omaha, Companion Life Insurance Co. of New York, M.
 Lowenstein Corporation, U.S. Rubber Reclaiming Inc., 
Studebaker-Worthington Inc., and Centaur Communications.
Cullman
 is survived by his wife of 73 years, Louise; their three children, Edgar Cullman Jr., 
formerly the president of General Cigar, and his wife Ellie, Lucy Cullman Danziger and her husband Mike, and Susan Cullman and her husband John Kirby; six grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and three step-grandchildren. 
A memorial service will be held at a later date.

CEO, General Cigar Company








Tweet









Culbro Corp., the corporate parent of General Cigar, has been enjoying an exciting year. Business for the cigar subsidiary is booming, and the corporation is repositioning itself to become a major player in not only cigars, but in cigar-related merchandise and upscale products. The biggest change has come at the top. The company's longtime chief executive officer, Edgar M. Cullman Sr., 78, turned over the day-to-day operations to his son, Edgar M. Cullman Jr.

  Cullman, 50, has been preparing for this job his entire adult life. After graduating from Yale University in 1968, he went through stints in the Army and then Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Co. as a management trainee. He joined General Cigar Co. in 1974, and became senior vice president for cigars and tobacco in 1976 and later that year, the executive vice president for marketing. He became executive vice president and chief operating officer of General Cigar in 1978 and was appointed in 1980 to president of the division as well as a member of the board of directors of Culbro. In 1983, he was named executive vice president of Culbro and took over as president the following year.

  Cullman's rise to the company's top job couldn't have come at a more challenging time. But his strategy is simple: keep the company at the top of the cigar industry. He discussed his plans for Culbro, and General Cigar, in a wide-ranging interview this past June with Marvin R. Shanken, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine.

CIGAR AFICIONADO: This year begins a new era for Culbro. How would you articulate your father's contribution to the company, and has the transition been difficult?

Cullman: Well, first let me say the transition wasn't difficult. The decision was one that he knew he had to make. It was just a question of when. He knew that it was going to happen, and he knew who was going to be taking over. That's made it easier. For his achievements, you've got to go back to 1961, when my father first bought in to the General Cigar Co. He bought a controlling interest at that point. It was really the culmination of his love of tobacco and the cigar industry. Over the years, he added a lot of businesses, many of which are not part of Culbro today. But the cigar business is still part of Culbro and it has been his vision all along and his love. He realized that if he could put all of those efforts against a business that was less difficult than the cigar business, he might have made more money. He might have been more successful, but at the end of the day he wouldn't have been as happy because he loved the cigar business. For him, it's been difficult to separate what is business and what is personal interest. If there's a legacy that he passes on to me, it is that if you hang onto it long enough, and you believe in it, it comes back.

Look at what is going on today in the cigar business. I pushed to de-emphasize the cigar business in the '80s and early '90s. We were struggling. You couldn't shed assets fast enough to maintain any viability. It is remarkable what has happened. So if there's a legacy here, it's to follow your heart and the things that you really believe in. You can add tremendous value in that kind of situation. That's what he has done all of his life.

CA: When you joined the company in 1974, what was your attitude towards cigars, and has it changed?

Cullman: I knew very little about cigars except through my father's discussions at the dinner table or other places. In 1974, after getting discharged from the Army, I had spent about three years with what at that time was Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Co., which is now Chase bank. I knew very little about the cigar business or the tobacco business, but I enjoyed smoking cigars, I enjoyed the legacy. The family legacy.

It was reassuring to know that I was entering a business that was not necessarily started by my father or even by my grandfather, but started really by my great-grandfather. That gives you a certain feeling of a place that you belong. And I felt right along that I belonged. I started working in Puerto Rico, where we were sorting Connecticut wrappers. I learned the process from A to Z. I lived down in Puerto Rico. My wife was pregnant with our first child and very upset that I wasn't home, but we lived through those first years. It was a real learning experience.

CA: How long did you do that?

Cullman: It wasn't that long. I spent from 1974 to about 1976 in a training mode in various positions throughout the company. I was in Puerto Rico. I was in Kingston, Jamaica; Tampa, Florida, where we had an operation; and in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, where we had a cigar factory. I was moving from our handmade factories to our machine-made factories. Throughout, I was learning everything about the cigar business. From tobacco growing and processing through cigar making.

CA: After that "training program," what happened in the next two or three years?

Cullman: My father constantly pushed me to do things. Just as I was getting comfortable understanding something, he would push me on to something else. I became head of the Connecticut operation, which was at that time the real estate business, the nursery business and the tobacco-growing business. All three divisions reported to one person, who was also head of the tobacco business; that influenced the emphasis that was given to the other two businesses. I was a sort of King Solomon who sorted out the needs of the various businesses. I learned a lot about the nursery business and the real estate business. From there, I went on to be president of General Cigar. I also had been head of all tobacco operations, where I worked with Alfons Mayer [the head tobacco buyer for the company].

CA: How big was General Cigar in terms of revenues when you became president in 1980?

Cullman: Less than half of what it is today. Our peak year was in 1969 when revenues were around $250 million. In the late '70s, it was struggling at around $50 million. But we've been growing rapidly. In 1994, revenues were about $88 million and climbed to $124 million in 1995, and in 1996, we expect at least $135 million.

CA: Let's go back for a minute. You are the fourth generation in the business. How did it start?

Cullman: My great-grandfather, who came from Germany, started in tobacco and later wrapper tobacco for cigars.

CA: When was the peak of Culbro tobacco farming operations in Connecticut?

Cullman: Well, I guess there were several golden eras. My grandfather started growing tobacco around 1910 in the Connecticut River Valley. That was when Connecticut Shade was introduced to the Connecticut valley. Prior to that he was dealing in tobaccos from around the world such as Indonesia and other countries.

CA: In an earlier interview with your father, he said that Culbro, at one point, had about 1,800 acres of tobacco?

Cullman: Yes.

CA: Today, how many acres do you own of wrapper tobacco land, and of that, how much is being farmed?

Cullman: We still own about 5,500 acres of land in Connecticut, but most of it is not available for tobacco now. I shouldn't say most of it. A good portion of it. We have about 330 acres that we're growing this summer.

CA: Isn't that substantially lower than in the past?

Cullman: Way down.

CA: But with the demand for large-leaf Connecticut wrappers growing so rapidly, why is the farming operation getting smaller and smaller?

Cullman: It actually has increased in the last three years. It was down to about 200 acres, when we hit our lowest point. The biggest problem is that every acre costs at least $25,000 to grow. It's just a risky and expensive business. We're able to today, because of our involvement with the grower Oliver Thrall, to have access to a lot more tobacco than we had before. Thrall is one of the growers in Connecticut who used to be with Windsor Shade. He has broken away from Windsor Shade as of last year. We processed tobacco for him in the Dominican Republic. And our agreement is such that we have first pick of certain tobaccos that he grows.

The real demand is for tobaccos for premium cigars, not for domestically made cigars. What we used to do is sell a significant portion of our tobacco to English buyers and use some of the rest for ourselves and for domestic cigars. The higher primings, the tobaccos that had more guts, were used for Macanudo. But we really are not in the business of growing tobacco for other manufacturers.

CA: How many acres does Thrall farm?

Cullman: He farms about 300-plus acres.

CA: But unlike Windsor Shade, you're vertically integrated.

Cullman: Yes, in that we use a lot of the tobacco we grow.

CA: And what you don't use for yourself, the higher quality tobacco, you sell primarily to the English market?

Cullman: Right.

CA: It's not sold to other cigar manufacturers?

Edgar Cullman Sr., 93, broadened cigars' appeal























A-A+


Margalit Fox / New York Times News Service









 Edgar M. Cullman Sr., a cigar maker who worked to broaden the appeal of his product in the late 20th century, helping transform its public image from an unwieldy mobster’s appendage to a cool and slim object of desire, died Sunday at his home in Stamford, Conn. He was 93.  His son, Edgar Jr., confirmed his death. 



 The elder Cullman was the longtime president, chairman and chief executive of the General Cigar Co., a leading manufacturer that over the years produced some of the country’s most ubiquitous cigars, including inexpensive and midpriced brands like White Owl, Tiparillo and Tijuana Smalls, and higher-priced ones like Macanudo, which has long been among the country’s best-selling premium cigars.  The Cullman family, known for its multigenerational tobacco interests, was involved with General Cigar from the early 1960s until 2005, when the company was sold to Swedish Match, a maker of snuff and other tobacco products. That year, General Cigar reported sales of more than $170 million, according to Culbro, which was General Cigar’s corporate parent from the 1970s to the 1990s. (Culbro is today the family’s private equity company.)  Edgar Meyer Cullman was born on Jan. 7, 1918, and, as a company publicist told Business Week in 1968, was “diapered in tobacco leaf.” His great-grandfather Ferdinand Kullman was a wine and tobacco merchant from Germany who settled in the United States in the 1840s. Ferdinand’s sons, Joseph and Jacob, founded Cullman Brothers, a tobacco brokerage house, in 1892.
