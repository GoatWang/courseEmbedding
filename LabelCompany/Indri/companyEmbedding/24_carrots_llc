We love helping couples create the most amazing day of their lives, with the people they care about most. When you tell us what your dream wedding is, we make it happen.


















A flawless experience centered around you
Your wedding should be the ultimate reflection of your personality. Small and quiet or big and loud? Formal and traditional or casual and trendy?

 Your wedding will always hold a special place in your heart and in the hearts of everyone who attends. The time you spend with your family and friends – enjoying a meal together, telling stories, dancing the night away – will stay with you forever. This is why we do what we do. Everyone at 24 Carrots is genuinely passionate about bringing people together to celebrate love and the tradition of marriage.

Summer Inspiration: Cake by the Ocean Cocktail

 By Carizza Rose   •   Categorized in 24 carrots catering, Catering, Event Announcements, Event Recaps, Secret Recipes
 

We are loving the summer vibes at Baker Party Rentals, as we celebrated their 35 year anniversary! To keep cool this summer, we’ve included the recipe for the fun signature cocktail, Cake by the Ocean, for you to make your own pitcher at home!




2 cups vanilla vodka






2 cups coconut rum






2 cups pineapple juice






2 cups orange juice






Club soda, optional






Maraschino cherries, pineapple, and orange slices for garnish (optional)



To make a pitcher: Add vodka, rum, and both juices to a pitcher filled with ice or frozen pineapple. Add 2-4 cups club soda to make it more like a punch, or to feed more people, if desired. Place some orange slices and pineapple wedges in the pitcher.
 

We hope you enjoy!
The rest of the Baker Jive 35 was full of some great treats and yummy designs, including a biscuit bar with housemade gravy – yum!!

We don’t do what we do for the accolades, but we love when our hard-working team gets appreciated for all the exceptional work they do.

24 Carrot Magic

 By Carizza Rose   •   Categorized in 24 carrots catering, Catering, Event Announcements, Event Recaps, Industry News
 

Our team works hard, but we sure do have a ton of fun doing it. We have Bruno Mars to thank for our team anthems, and in celebratory Spring style, we got 24 Carrots Bruno-Mars style hats custom made and captured our team moving and grooving to 24 Carat Magic and That’s What I Like.
Enjoy a bit of 24 Carrot magic today! Thank you to Bruno for the music, and Villa Visuals for the epic photos! We sure are “hashtag-blessed!”

Kanye-Inspired Tasting Menu

 By Carizza Rose   •   Categorized in 24 carrots catering, Catering, Event Announcements, Event Recaps, sales, Secret Recipes, Style Tips
 

While we take food very seriously around here, we’re always down to play around with food and love getting inspired by our client’s favorites things – whether it’s a traditional dish, or in this case, a rather unconventional source of inspiration: Kanye West. We had a special VIP tasting and used this opportunity to showcase our client’s love of Kanye. We hope you enjoy!

Eggs Over Yeezy: Avocado Toast + Fried Quail Egg
 
Uh-Huh Honey: Fig, Honey, Pecan, Herb Cheese, Endive
 
Kanye Asada Fries: Carne Asada, Tomatoes, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Cilantro, Queso Fresco
 
Aint Nobody Fresher Than My: Petite Compressed Salad of Baby Arugula
 
Run This Town: Sweet Corn Ravioli

What She Order, Fish Filet?: Chili and Spice-Rubbed Chilean Seabass | Lemon-Herb and Pistachio Rice Pilaf | Roasted Asparagus with Smoked Sea Salt

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
