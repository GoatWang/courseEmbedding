 Blue Gardenia CD music Product Description

Blue Gardenia album for sale by Charles Davis was released Mar 07, 2003 on the Reade Street label. Personnel: Charles Davis (tenor & baritone saxophones); Cedar Walton (piano); Peter Washington (bass); Joe Farnsworth (drums). Blue Gardenia CD music contains a single disc with 8 songs. Recorded at Systems Two, Brooklyn, New York on February 26, 2002. One of JazzTimes top 50 releases! FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES!"This was a good idea: getting the 70-year old saxophonist Charles Davis, who has played in supporting roles with Dinah Washington, Steve Lacy, Kenny Dorham, Sun Ra, Barry Harris and others, to make a lasting artifact as a bandleader Blue Gardenia album for sale. For a tiny independent label, Reade Street Records, it didn't take much more than setting him up with the new version of the pianist Cedar Walton's trio, a crackling example of jazz's maturing mainstream." Blue Gardenia CD music. "Mr. Davis is best known for playing the baritone saxophone, but for the first half of the album he plays tenor with a rather elegant understatement. He balances melodic embellishment with the kind of magpie's relationship to chords that Coleman Hawkins practiced, running up and down them, creating exotic intervals. And the material is well chosen: Mr. Davis's own elegant blues waltz "Texas Moon," tunes by his friends Frank Lacy and John Weston, and "A Beautiful Friendship" and "Blue Gardenia," not the most widely covered standards in the world. The rhythm section, with Mr. Walton, the bassist Peter Washington and the drummer Joe Farnsworth, plays impeccably, finding perfect tempos and a beautifully even projection of sound. If stores fail, you can find this album at  readestreetrecords ." -BEN RATLIFFFROM ALL ABOUT JAZZ:"Straightahead saxophone jazz rarely gets better than this"FROM JAZZ CRITIC NAT HENTOFF:"this recording is a classic definition of the lifeforce of jazz" FROM BASS PLAYER MAGAZINE:"This is a great collection of swinging jazz in the classic mold"ABOUT CHARLES DAVIS:Although he has performed previously on tenor and alto, Charles Davis is best-known for his fine baritone playing, both as a soloist and for his dependable work in sax sections.   ...See Full Description

CMJ (6/30/03, p.31) - "...His remarkably light and delicate tone is great for ensemble playing....An excellent return to the recording arena..."JazzTimes (10/03, p.85) - "...Charles Davis speaks the vernacular of '60s hard bop, eloquently and naturally....BLUE GARDENIA is one of the great sleeper jazz albums of 2003..."

the book and WileyPLUS, and test bank questions and
problems, give instructors more flexibility to assess specific
learning objectives.
New C&C Sports Continuing Case in the end-of-chapter

concepts in a business decision making setting.
Thoroughly updated “Reality Checks” introduce
students to the latest business world applications, and show
relevance of managerial accounting to various business
majors. 
Increased focus on context through design. In this

retail, and the supply chain.

The Wiley Advantage

Students are better prepared for class after working
through LEARNING UNITS introduced by Davis and Davis. 
LEARNING UNITS include manageable segments of student
friendly exposition immediately followed by practice sections
called UNIT REVIEWS that include key terms, self-study
questions, and practice exercises with worked out
solutions. 
The consistent context of C&C Sports (a producer of
baseball uniforms), and its business partners in the LEARNING
UNITS and throughout the narrative of the text, allows
students to learn new concepts more quickly, since they are
not relearning a new context every time a new concept is
introduced.  
With plenty of relevant real-world examples in REALITY
CHECKS and fun hip companies featured in the Managerial
Accounting Videos Series, students see the relevance of
managerial accounting to their future careers, and are better
equipped to develop decision making skills for today’s
business environment.  
Current users and reviewers alike value the quantity and
quality of practice questions and end of chapter problems available
in the Davis, Managerial Accounting program. These give
instructors and students plenty of opportunity for practice and
learning outcomes assessment both in the book and online in
WileyPLUS.
WileyPLUS is now equipped with an adaptive learning
module called ORION. Based on cognitive science,
WileyPLUS with ORION, provides students with a personal,
adaptive learning experience so they can build their proficiency on
topics and use their study time most effectively. WileyPLUS
with ORION helps students learn by learning about them.

Making Disciples Across Cultures: Missional Principles for a Diverse World 


Davis, Charles A. (Author)	
									        	
									






Description


										Culture affects how we make disciples. We often unconsciously bring our own cultural assumptions into ministry and mission, not realizing that how we think and operate is not necessarily the best or only way to do things. In today's global environment, disciplemaking requires the cultural humility and flexibility to adapt between different cultural approaches. Charles Davis, former director of TEAM, provides a framework for missional disciplemaking across diverse cultural contexts. He shows how we can recalibrate our ministry efforts, like adjusting sound levels on a mixer board, to accommodate different cultural assumptions. With on-the-ground stories from a lifetime of mission experience, Davis navigates such tensions as knowledge and behavior, individualism and collectivism, and truth and works to help Christian workers minister more effectively. Ministry teams, church planters, pastors and missionaries working interculturally at home or overseas can be part of God's movement of making disciples. Discover how the body of Christ grows in the unity and diversity of the global church.
