HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Exterran and Exterran Partners are pleased to announce the future name 
      of the market leader in U.S. natural gas contract compression services: 
      Archrock.
    


      In the third quarter of 2015, Exterran expects to separate its 
      international contract operations, international aftermarket services 
      and global product line businesses into a standalone company, resulting 
      in two independent companies. The remaining company, which will be 
      called Archrock, will be the leading provider of natural gas contract 
      compression services and a premier provider of aftermarket services and 
      parts to customers in the oil and natural gas industry throughout the 
      United States.
    

      “Archrock will continue to offer our customers contract compression 
      services utilizing the country’s largest fleet, well-established 
      relationships with OEM manufacturers and distributors, and outstanding 
      aftermarket parts and service capability,” said President and CEO Brad 
      Childers. “The Archrock name, with its ties to the natural world and its 
      message of connection, is a fitting reflection of the way we perform for 
      our customers. With approximately 3.7 million operating horsepower in 
      our compression services fleet across the United States, we are strong, 
      we are here for the long term and we bridge divides — connecting with 
      our customers, employees and communities. We are where our customers 
      need us.”
    

      After the completion of the separation transaction, Exterran Partners, 
      L.P., a master limited partnership, will be named “Archrock Partners, 
      L.P.”
    

      The company comprising Exterran’s global product lines and non-U.S. 
      services will continue to be called “Exterran.” It will continue to be a 
      market leader supplying customers throughout the world engaged in all 
      aspects of the oil and natural gas industry.
    

      “Exterran’s customers can continue to rely on our legacy of proven 
      world-wide performance,” said Executive Vice President Andrew Way, who 
      will become President and CEO of Exterran when the transaction is 
      complete.
    

      Exterran’s global product lines will include production equipment, 
      natural gas compression equipment, processing and treating equipment and 
      water treatment solutions. In addition, outside the United States, it 
      will continue to be a leading provider of full-service natural gas 
      contract compression and a supplier of new, used, OEM and aftermarket 
      parts and services.

Forward-Looking Statements


      All statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the 
      subjects of this release) other than historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the 
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking 
      statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and 
      are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are 
      outside the control of Exterran Holdings and Exterran Partners (the 
      “Companies”), which could cause actual results to differ materially from 
      such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not 
      limited to, the Companies’ financial and operational strategies and 
      ability to successfully effect those strategies; the expected benefits 
      and timing of the separation transaction mentioned in this press 
      release; the Companies’ continued leadership positions in the businesses 
      in which they compete; statements regarding the expected President and 
      CEO of Exterran; the Companies’ expectations regarding future economic 
      and market conditions; the Companies’ financial and operational outlook 
      and ability to fulfill that outlook; and demand for the Companies’ 
      products and services and growth opportunities for those products and 
      services.
    

      While the Companies believe that the assumptions concerning future 
      events are reasonable, they caution that there are inherent difficulties 
      in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future 
      performance or results of their business. Among the factors that could 
      cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: local, regional, national and 
      international economic conditions and the impact they may have on the 
      Companies and their customers; changes in tax laws that impact master 
      limited partnerships; conditions in the oil and gas industry, including 
      a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural 
      gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas; Exterran 
      Holdings’ ability to timely and cost-effectively execute larger 
      projects; delays, costs and difficulties that could impact the 
      completion and expected results of the separation transaction; changes 
      in political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including 
      international markets; any non-performance by third parties of their 
      contractual obligations; changes in safety, health environmental and 
      other regulations; and, as to each of the Companies, the performance of 
      the other entity.
    

      These forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, 
      forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in 
      Exterran Holdings’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
      December 31, 2014, Exterran Partners’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
      year ended December 31, 2014, and those set forth from time to time in 
      the Companies’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
      which are currently available at www.exterran.com. 
      Except as required by law, the Companies expressly disclaim any 
      intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking 
      statements whether as a result of new information, future events or 
      otherwise.
