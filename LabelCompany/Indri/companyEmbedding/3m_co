We love the sun, but too much of it can bring unwanted heat, glare and damaging UV rays into our homes. An excess of any of these can make parts of your home unbearable and can even damage your valuables. Take control of the sun with 3M Window Films.
Protection from UV damage and fading.
The sun can be harmful even indoors, since most glass windows do not filter a majority of the sun’s UV rays. This can leave you, your family and your belongings exposed to the damaging effects of ultraviolet(UV) rays.
3M Window Films act as a filter for sunlight. They block 99.9% of the sun’s UV rays protecting you and your furniture, flooring, photos, window treatments, and other valuables from fading.

Frequently Asked Questions
Will it make my windows dark or reflective?It doesn’t have to. Although we do offer reflective and light reducing (darker) window films many modern window film solutions come in a extremely clear solution offering maximum light to enter through your windows with no distortion in clarity or appearance change to your current windows.
Will window film damage my windows in any way?With proper window film selection (that’s where we come in) there is little risk to your windows, seals or frames. In fact we offer warranties against such things as thermal breakage and seal failures (when applicable). Contact us for more information.Is window film a difficult project to install? Why not just get new windows?We try really hard to make the process as simple as possible. Most residential window film projects are completed in a day. It takes very little effort on your part for the installation to take place. Window film is a fraction of the cost of window replacement and for many customs homes replacing windows can be challenging and costly. Window film is a simple alternative to upgrade any window or glass. Contact us for a free estimate to learn more.How much does window film cost?Great question. Every home has a different amount of windows with various shapes and sizes. Not to mention each project has different circumstances. That’s why we offer upfront pricing with our free estimates and for most jobs we can price over the phone or through email. However, to provide a basic guideline most projects fall within three separate budgets. Small (1-10 windows) $500 – $1500, Medium (10-20 windows) $1500 – $5000, Large ( 10 – 50+ windows) $5000 +. Keep mind this is just a ballpark, window sizes, product selection and the scope of work all play an important factor in determine the final price.
I can't afford it right now. Can I just do it myself?We can not sell our 3M window film products as a Do-it-Yourself solution. The reason being is there are strict quality control guidelines that go into place in order to offer our life-time guarantee on our installations and window film products. However, we do offer our DIY window film solutions with installation instructions in our online store.

Have you changed the cutting feature? I hate the plastic cutting edge, it rarely cuts well, I end up with torn product.  Very annoying. Probably will not buy again.

I recently had surgery and used press's seal to wrap my foot to keep the incision dry when showering. It worked fantastic! Press'n seal is not justfor the kitchen.

        TEARable Dispenser
Love the product, but the dispenser is by far the most useless container I have ever come across. GLAD's lack of engineering or design shows when you try to use the useless jagged edge of a piece of cardboard as a cutting divice for the wrap. You end up with trash when ever you try to rip it across that useless design.

        Dispenser is a disaster
Product provides great seal but the dispenser is so terrible I avoid using the product.  Surely you can engineer a dispenser that doesn't fall apart and works reliably.  Would only recommend this product with huge warning to prepare for frustration.

        Diminished quality
Glad Press 'n Seal used to be the best product on the market for wrapping food. Now we can't get the wrap to tear off without it being an uneven mess and eventually we're unable to get it to unroll at all. Last night I heard my husband wrestling with something in the kitchen, minutes later he handed me the product and told me to mail it back to Glad, and to ask them what we're supposed to do with this mess. I chose this route because I didn't want to spend any more money on this.

        New plastic cutter edge is HORRIBLE!
I have used Press'n Seal for years and used to LOVE it.  It is the only wrap product we use.  I have literally had multiple conversations with various friends during which I told them that Press'n Seal is far superior to traditional plastic wrap.  However, we noticed that you changed the cutter (to tear off a piece of wrap) to a flimsy plastic cutter.  It's horrible!  PLEASE change it to a better quality metal one.  The plastic edge does not cut through the Press'n Seal, so you end up trying to force the wrap to tear, then it wrinkles and sticks to itself.  AWFUL.  I'm not sure if this was poorly thought out cost-savings idea or if some nut claimed that the metal edge is "too dangerous", but you have got to fix this.  We will sadly no longer be using your product if it continues to have the pathetic plastic cutter.

        Threw it away
I bought this product because it sounded similar to Saran Wrap and the store was out of the regular Cling Wrap.  I used it once to wrap some left over chicken and I needed a chisel to get the food out of the wrap the next day.  Tonight I was going to try to wrap some left over chicken.  I guess the roll decided to seal itself because I could not find the end.  I tried for a long time and then tried to loosen with the tip of a sharp knife. No luck anyway I tried and I finally gave us after 15 frustrating minutes.  It is going in the garbage now that I took a picture for you.  I am a 73 year old male who does all the cooking and everything else for a disabled wife and this product did not make things better for me.  I have used Glad products for the last 50 years but I will go back to something easier to use.  I regret that I paid about $4 for this product and had to throw it out.

	About 3M

      
 











            How can science change the world?
            

Carrying more power to more people with lighter power lines. Helping manufacturers make more with less through leaner processes. Automating health care data so the right people get the right information to take action. These are some of the ways we’re working to support stronger communities and sustainable development across the globe. We see the world's challenges clearly, and unite the people that dare to solve them. We innovate with purpose and use science every day to create real impact in every life around the world.

We love the sun, but too much of it can bring unwanted heat, glare and damaging UV rays into our homes. An excess of any of these can make parts of your home unbearable and can even damage your valuables. Take control of the sun with 3M Window Films.
Protection from UV damage and fading.
The sun can be harmful even indoors, since most glass windows do not filter a majority of the sun’s UV rays. This can leave you, your family and your belongings exposed to the damaging effects of ultraviolet(UV) rays.
3M Window Films act as a filter for sunlight. They block 99.9% of the sun’s UV rays protecting you and your furniture, flooring, photos, window treatments, and other valuables from fading.

Frequently Asked Questions
Will it make my windows dark or reflective?It doesn’t have to. Although we do offer reflective and light reducing (darker) window films many modern window film solutions come in a extremely clear solution offering maximum light to enter through your windows with no distortion in clarity or appearance change to your current windows.
Will window film damage my windows in any way?With proper window film selection (that’s where we come in) there is little risk to your windows, seals or frames. In fact we offer warranties against such things as thermal breakage and seal failures (when applicable). Contact us for more information.Is window film a difficult project to install? Why not just get new windows?We try really hard to make the process as simple as possible. Most residential window film projects are completed in a day. It takes very little effort on your part for the installation to take place. Window film is a fraction of the cost of window replacement and for many customs homes replacing windows can be challenging and costly. Window film is a simple alternative to upgrade any window or glass. Contact us for a free estimate to learn more.How much does window film cost?Great question. Every home has a different amount of windows with various shapes and sizes. Not to mention each project has different circumstances. That’s why we offer upfront pricing with our free estimates and for most jobs we can price over the phone or through email. However, to provide a basic guideline most projects fall within three separate budgets. Small (1-10 windows) $500 – $1500, Medium (10-20 windows) $1500 – $5000, Large ( 10 – 50+ windows) $5000 +. Keep mind this is just a ballpark, window sizes, product selection and the scope of work all play an important factor in determine the final price.
I can't afford it right now. Can I just do it myself?We can not sell our 3M window film products as a Do-it-Yourself solution. The reason being is there are strict quality control guidelines that go into place in order to offer our life-time guarantee on our installations and window film products. However, we do offer our DIY window film solutions with installation instructions in our online store.

Have you changed the cutting feature? I hate the plastic cutting edge, it rarely cuts well, I end up with torn product.  Very annoying. Probably will not buy again.

I recently had surgery and used press's seal to wrap my foot to keep the incision dry when showering. It worked fantastic! Press'n seal is not justfor the kitchen.

        TEARable Dispenser
Love the product, but the dispenser is by far the most useless container I have ever come across. GLAD's lack of engineering or design shows when you try to use the useless jagged edge of a piece of cardboard as a cutting divice for the wrap. You end up with trash when ever you try to rip it across that useless design.

        Dispenser is a disaster
Product provides great seal but the dispenser is so terrible I avoid using the product.  Surely you can engineer a dispenser that doesn't fall apart and works reliably.  Would only recommend this product with huge warning to prepare for frustration.

        Diminished quality
Glad Press 'n Seal used to be the best product on the market for wrapping food. Now we can't get the wrap to tear off without it being an uneven mess and eventually we're unable to get it to unroll at all. Last night I heard my husband wrestling with something in the kitchen, minutes later he handed me the product and told me to mail it back to Glad, and to ask them what we're supposed to do with this mess. I chose this route because I didn't want to spend any more money on this.

        New plastic cutter edge is HORRIBLE!
I have used Press'n Seal for years and used to LOVE it.  It is the only wrap product we use.  I have literally had multiple conversations with various friends during which I told them that Press'n Seal is far superior to traditional plastic wrap.  However, we noticed that you changed the cutter (to tear off a piece of wrap) to a flimsy plastic cutter.  It's horrible!  PLEASE change it to a better quality metal one.  The plastic edge does not cut through the Press'n Seal, so you end up trying to force the wrap to tear, then it wrinkles and sticks to itself.  AWFUL.  I'm not sure if this was poorly thought out cost-savings idea or if some nut claimed that the metal edge is "too dangerous", but you have got to fix this.  We will sadly no longer be using your product if it continues to have the pathetic plastic cutter.

        Threw it away
I bought this product because it sounded similar to Saran Wrap and the store was out of the regular Cling Wrap.  I used it once to wrap some left over chicken and I needed a chisel to get the food out of the wrap the next day.  Tonight I was going to try to wrap some left over chicken.  I guess the roll decided to seal itself because I could not find the end.  I tried for a long time and then tried to loosen with the tip of a sharp knife. No luck anyway I tried and I finally gave us after 15 frustrating minutes.  It is going in the garbage now that I took a picture for you.  I am a 73 year old male who does all the cooking and everything else for a disabled wife and this product did not make things better for me.  I have used Glad products for the last 50 years but I will go back to something easier to use.  I regret that I paid about $4 for this product and had to throw it out.

Five businessmen founded 3M in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902.[5] Originally a mining venture, the goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value.[5] Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905.[5] The company moved to Duluth and began research and producing sandpaper products.[5] William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A. G. Bush joined in 1909.[5] 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends.[5]
The company moved to St. Paul in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in Maplewood, Minnesota in 1962.[6] The new Maplewood campus is 475 acres (1.92 km2) and has over 50 buildings, including an Innovation Center that displays products 3M has taken to market.
The company began by mining stone from quarries for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business.[7] Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S&P 500.

The John Dwan Office Building, where 3M was founded; now a museum


The founders original plan was to sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.[8]
Failing to make sandpaper with the anorthosite, the founders decided to import minerals like Spanish garnet, after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers complained that the garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; this was the first instance of research and development at 3M.
Expansion[edit]
The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane "Scotch Tape" and sound-deadening materials for cars.
In 1947, 3M began to producing PFOA by electrochemical fluorination.[9] During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair.
In 1951, DuPont started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion dollars a year profit by the 1990s.[10] DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.[11]
In 1951, international sales were approximately $20 million. 3M's achievements were recognized by the American Institute of Management naming the company "one of the five best-managed companies in the United States" and included it among the top 12 growth stocks (3M).[12]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of board games, largely under the "3M bookshelf game series" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through department stores, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German "Eurogames". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by Avalon Hill.




3M traffic signals installed in Shelton, Washington. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals are invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic in daylight. (A faint glow is visible at night.)






The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication.


3M's Mincom division introduced several models of magnetic tape recorders for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of video switchers, from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work.
3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the "3M Digital Audio Mastering System",[13] which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for mixdown & final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.
In 1980, the company introduced Post-it notes. In 1996, the company's data storage and imaging divisions were spun off as Imation Corporation, now called Glassbridge Enterprises. Imation has since sold its imaging and photographic film businesses to concentrate on storage.
Today, 3M is one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (added on August 9, 1976), and is 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list.[14] The company has 132 plants and over 67,000 employees worldwide, with sales offices in over 200 countries[citation needed]. The vast majority of the company's employees are local nationals, with few employees residing outside their home country. Its worldwide sales are over $20 billion, with international sales 58% of that total.
In 2002, 3M Co. agreed to acquire AiT Advanced Information Technologies Corp. for about $37.4-million in cash, after AiT had strongly hinted it had put itself on the auction block.
On December 20, 2005, 3M announced a major partnership with Roush-Fenway Racing, one of NASCAR's premier organizations. In 2008, the company sponsored Greg Biffle in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series as he drove the No. 16 Ford Fusion. In addition, on February 19, 2006, 3M announced that it would become the title sponsor of the 3M Performance 400 at Michigan International Speedway until 2011.
On April 4, 2006, 3M announced its intention to sell its pharmaceutical non-core business. The pharmaceuticals businesses were sold off in three deals, in Europe, the Americas, and the remainder of the world. Another division of the Health Care business, Drug Delivery Systems, remains with 3M. The Drug Delivery System division continues to contract manufacture inhalants and transdermal drug-delivery systems, and has now taken on manufacture of the products whose licenses were sold during the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business.[15] On September 8, 2008, 3M announced an agreement to acquire Meguiar's, a car-care products company that was family-owned for over a century.[16]
On August 30, 2010, 3M announced that they had acquired Cogent Systems for $943 million.[17]
On October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc.[18] In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company.
3M follows a business model based on "the ability to not only develop unique products, but also to manufacture them efficiently and consistently around the world".[19]
On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of Avery Dennison was being bought by 3M for $550 million.[20] The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns.[21]
In March 2017, it was announced that 3M was purchasing Johnson Control International Plc's safety gear business, Scott Safety, for $2 billion.[22]
Environmental record[edit]




The Target Light System, built by 3M at Target headquarters in Minneapolis.[23]


In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.[24] 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000.[25] Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics.[26] The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002.[27] In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be "cleaned through a combination of groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands.[28] The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River.[27] The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.[29]
In 1983, the Oakdale Dump in Oakdale, Minnesota, was listed as an EPA Superfund site after significant groundwater and soil contamination by VOCs and heavy metals was uncovered.[30] The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s.
In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management.[31][32]
In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M, claiming they released PFCs, a very toxic chemical according to the EPA but unknown at the time of release, into local waterways.[33]
Operating facilities[edit]




3M facility in St. Paul, Minnesota


3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in Maplewood, Minnesota. In the United States, 3M has nine sales offices in eight states and operates 74 manufacturing facilities in 27 states. Internationally, 3M has 148 sales offices. It operates 93 manufacturing and converting facilities in 32 countries outside the United States.[34]
3M owns substantially all of its physical properties. Because 3M is a global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments[35] including Integrity Supply.
Selected factory detail information:

Cynthiana, Kentucky, USA factory producing Post-It notes (672 SKU) and scotch tape (147 SKU). It has 539 employees and was established in 1969.[36]
Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, UK factory producing respirators for workers safety, using laser technology. It has 370 employees and recently there was an investment of £4,5 million ($7 million).[37][38]

History[edit]

Five businessmen founded 3M in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902.[5] Originally a mining venture, the goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value.[5] Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905.[5] The company moved to Duluth and began research and producing sandpaper products.[5] William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A. G. Bush joined in 1909.[5] 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends.[5]
The company moved to St. Paul in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in Maplewood, Minnesota in 1962.[6] The new Maplewood campus is 475 acres (1.92 km2) and has over 50 buildings, including an Innovation Center that displays products 3M has taken to market.
The company began by mining stone from quarries for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business.[7] Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S&P 500.

The John Dwan Office Building, where 3M was founded; now a museum


The founders original plan was to sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.[8]
Failing to make sandpaper with the anorthosite, the founders decided to import minerals like Spanish garnet, after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers complained that the garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; this was the first instance of research and development at 3M.
Expansion[edit]
The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane "Scotch Tape" and sound-deadening materials for cars.
In 1947, 3M began to producing PFOA by electrochemical fluorination.[9] During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair.
In 1951, DuPont started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion dollars a year profit by the 1990s.[10] DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.[11]
In 1951, international sales were approximately $20 million. 3M's achievements were recognized by the American Institute of Management naming the company "one of the five best-managed companies in the United States" and included it among the top 12 growth stocks (3M).[12]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of board games, largely under the "3M bookshelf game series" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through department stores, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German "Eurogames". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by Avalon Hill.

3M's Mincom division introduced several models of magnetic tape recorders for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of video switchers, from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work.
3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the "3M Digital Audio Mastering System",[13] which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for mixdown & final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.
In 1980, the company introduced Post-it notes. In 1996, the company's data storage and imaging divisions were spun off as Imation Corporation, now called Glassbridge Enterprises. Imation has since sold its imaging and photographic film businesses to concentrate on storage.
Today, 3M is one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (added on August 9, 1976), and is 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list.[14] The company has 132 plants and over 67,000 employees worldwide, with sales offices in over 200 countries[citation needed]. The vast majority of the company's employees are local nationals, with few employees residing outside their home country. Its worldwide sales are over $20 billion, with international sales 58% of that total.
In 2002, 3M Co. agreed to acquire AiT Advanced Information Technologies Corp. for about $37.4-million in cash, after AiT had strongly hinted it had put itself on the auction block.
On December 20, 2005, 3M announced a major partnership with Roush-Fenway Racing, one of NASCAR's premier organizations. In 2008, the company sponsored Greg Biffle in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series as he drove the No. 16 Ford Fusion. In addition, on February 19, 2006, 3M announced that it would become the title sponsor of the 3M Performance 400 at Michigan International Speedway until 2011.
On April 4, 2006, 3M announced its intention to sell its pharmaceutical non-core business. The pharmaceuticals businesses were sold off in three deals, in Europe, the Americas, and the remainder of the world. Another division of the Health Care business, Drug Delivery Systems, remains with 3M. The Drug Delivery System division continues to contract manufacture inhalants and transdermal drug-delivery systems, and has now taken on manufacture of the products whose licenses were sold during the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business.[15] On September 8, 2008, 3M announced an agreement to acquire Meguiar's, a car-care products company that was family-owned for over a century.[16]
On August 30, 2010, 3M announced that they had acquired Cogent Systems for $943 million.[17]
On October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc.[18] In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company.
3M follows a business model based on "the ability to not only develop unique products, but also to manufacture them efficiently and consistently around the world".[19]
On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of Avery Dennison was being bought by 3M for $550 million.[20] The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns.[21]
In March 2017, it was announced that 3M was purchasing Johnson Control International Plc's safety gear business, Scott Safety, for $2 billion.[22]
Environmental record[edit]




The Target Light System, built by 3M at Target headquarters in Minneapolis.[23]


In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.[24] 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000.[25] Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics.[26] The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002.[27] In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be "cleaned through a combination of groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands.[28] The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River.[27] The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.[29]
In 1983, the Oakdale Dump in Oakdale, Minnesota, was listed as an EPA Superfund site after significant groundwater and soil contamination by VOCs and heavy metals was uncovered.[30] The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s.
In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management.[31][32]
In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M, claiming they released PFCs, a very toxic chemical according to the EPA but unknown at the time of release, into local waterways.[33]
Operating facilities[edit]




3M facility in St. Paul, Minnesota


3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in Maplewood, Minnesota. In the United States, 3M has nine sales offices in eight states and operates 74 manufacturing facilities in 27 states. Internationally, 3M has 148 sales offices. It operates 93 manufacturing and converting facilities in 32 countries outside the United States.[34]
3M owns substantially all of its physical properties. Because 3M is a global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments[35] including Integrity Supply.
Selected factory detail information:

Cynthiana, Kentucky, USA factory producing Post-It notes (672 SKU) and scotch tape (147 SKU). It has 539 employees and was established in 1969.[36]
Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, UK factory producing respirators for workers safety, using laser technology. It has 370 employees and recently there was an investment of £4,5 million ($7 million).[37][38]

Five businessmen founded 3M in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902.[5] Originally a mining venture, the goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value.[5] Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905.[5] The company moved to Duluth and began research and producing sandpaper products.[5] William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A. G. Bush joined in 1909.[5] 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends.[5]
The company moved to St. Paul in 1910, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Center in Maplewood, Minnesota in 1962.[6] The new Maplewood campus is 475 acres (1.92 km2) and has over 50 buildings, including an Innovation Center that displays products 3M has taken to market.
The company began by mining stone from quarries for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business.[7] Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company's stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S&P 500.

The John Dwan Office Building, where 3M was founded; now a museum


The founders original plan was to sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.[8]
Failing to make sandpaper with the anorthosite, the founders decided to import minerals like Spanish garnet, after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers complained that the garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; this was the first instance of research and development at 3M.
Expansion[edit]
The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane "Scotch Tape" and sound-deadening materials for cars.
In 1947, 3M began to producing PFOA by electrochemical fluorination.[9] During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair.
In 1951, DuPont started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a billion dollars a year profit by the 1990s.[10] DuPont referred to PFOA as C8.[11]
In 1951, international sales were approximately $20 million. 3M's achievements were recognized by the American Institute of Management naming the company "one of the five best-managed companies in the United States" and included it among the top 12 growth stocks (3M).[12]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of board games, largely under the "3M bookshelf game series" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through department stores, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German "Eurogames". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by Avalon Hill.




3M traffic signals installed in Shelton, Washington. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals are invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic in daylight. (A faint glow is visible at night.)






The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication.


3M's Mincom division introduced several models of magnetic tape recorders for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of video switchers, from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work.
3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the "3M Digital Audio Mastering System",[13] which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for mixdown & final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.
In 1980, the company introduced Post-it notes. In 1996, the company's data storage and imaging divisions were spun off as Imation Corporation, now called Glassbridge Enterprises. Imation has since sold its imaging and photographic film businesses to concentrate on storage.
Today, 3M is one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (added on August 9, 1976), and is 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list.[14] The company has 132 plants and over 67,000 employees worldwide, with sales offices in over 200 countries[citation needed]. The vast majority of the company's employees are local nationals, with few employees residing outside their home country. Its worldwide sales are over $20 billion, with international sales 58% of that total.
In 2002, 3M Co. agreed to acquire AiT Advanced Information Technologies Corp. for about $37.4-million in cash, after AiT had strongly hinted it had put itself on the auction block.
On December 20, 2005, 3M announced a major partnership with Roush-Fenway Racing, one of NASCAR's premier organizations. In 2008, the company sponsored Greg Biffle in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series as he drove the No. 16 Ford Fusion. In addition, on February 19, 2006, 3M announced that it would become the title sponsor of the 3M Performance 400 at Michigan International Speedway until 2011.
On April 4, 2006, 3M announced its intention to sell its pharmaceutical non-core business. The pharmaceuticals businesses were sold off in three deals, in Europe, the Americas, and the remainder of the world. Another division of the Health Care business, Drug Delivery Systems, remains with 3M. The Drug Delivery System division continues to contract manufacture inhalants and transdermal drug-delivery systems, and has now taken on manufacture of the products whose licenses were sold during the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business.[15] On September 8, 2008, 3M announced an agreement to acquire Meguiar's, a car-care products company that was family-owned for over a century.[16]
On August 30, 2010, 3M announced that they had acquired Cogent Systems for $943 million.[17]
On October 13, 2010, 3M completed acquisition of Arizant Inc.[18] In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company.
3M follows a business model based on "the ability to not only develop unique products, but also to manufacture them efficiently and consistently around the world".[19]
On January 3, 2012, it was announced that the Office and Consumer Products Division of Avery Dennison was being bought by 3M for $550 million.[20] The transaction was canceled by 3M in September 2012 amid antitrust concerns.[21]
In March 2017, it was announced that 3M was purchasing Johnson Control International Plc's safety gear business, Scott Safety, for $2 billion.[22]
Environmental record[edit]




The Target Light System, built by 3M at Target headquarters in Minneapolis.[23]


In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began investigating perfluorinated chemicals after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.[24] 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000.[25] Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics.[26] The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002.[27] In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be "cleaned through a combination of groundwater pump-out wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands.[28] The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River.[27] The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.[29]
In 1983, the Oakdale Dump in Oakdale, Minnesota, was listed as an EPA Superfund site after significant groundwater and soil contamination by VOCs and heavy metals was uncovered.[30] The Oakdale Dump was a 3M dumping site utilized through the 1940s and 1950s.
In 2008, 3M created the Renewable Energy Division within 3M's Industrial and Transportation Business to focus on Energy Generation and Energy Management.[31][32]
In late 2010, the state of Minnesota sued 3M, claiming they released PFCs, a very toxic chemical according to the EPA but unknown at the time of release, into local waterways.[33]
Operating facilities[edit]




3M facility in St. Paul, Minnesota


3M's general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division laboratories are located in Maplewood, Minnesota. In the United States, 3M has nine sales offices in eight states and operates 74 manufacturing facilities in 27 states. Internationally, 3M has 148 sales offices. It operates 93 manufacturing and converting facilities in 32 countries outside the United States.[34]
3M owns substantially all of its physical properties. Because 3M is a global enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often used by multiple business segments[35] including Integrity Supply.
Selected factory detail information:

Cynthiana, Kentucky, USA factory producing Post-It notes (672 SKU) and scotch tape (147 SKU). It has 539 employees and was established in 1969.[36]
Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, UK factory producing respirators for workers safety, using laser technology. It has 370 employees and recently there was an investment of £4,5 million ($7 million).[37][38]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Our Customers Say

 
  Great instructions and complete professional tool kit. Your film is so clear I can hardly tell where it begins and ends.

 Eric S. Wilmington Fairbury,NE - Satisfied Customer



 
  I purchased a cheaper clear bra product from one of your competitors and it ended up in the trash. Very poor fit! I purchased your product and applied it myself. Excellent product guys!!!

 Doug W. San Jose, CA - Satisfied Customer



 
  This is one of the best investments I've made all year. Invisiblemask took out the guesswork for the consumer.

 Cory G. Boise,ID - Satisfied Customer



 
  I do a lot of driving and my last car got pretty beat up. I just bought a new car and immediately applied your product. I have no worries now and really love this product!

 Jack Fowler San Diego, CA - Satisfied Customer

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
