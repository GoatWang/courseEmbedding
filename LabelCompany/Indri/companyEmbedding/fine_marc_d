Specialties of Fine, Marc D. Attorney:

Attorneys
Banking & Investment Lawyers
Corporate Business Lawyers
Corporate Finance & Securities Lawyers
Estate Planning & Administration Lawyers













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.


Banking & Investment Lawyers: Despite a changing economy, investment banking and law remain popular career paths for ambitious young people. Both careers offer the chance to make a lot of money right out of school. Moreover, prestige and upward mobility, two additional defining characteristics, attract the best and brightest into both investment banking and law.


Corporate Business Lawyers: A corporate lawyer is also known as In-House Counsel, Staff Attorney, Deputy General Counsel, General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer. Their primary objective is to serve the interests of the corporation, not the owners of the business or the officers who run it. In addition to legal counsel, they may also be called upon to provide business advice. They may practice other areas of law concerning mergers and acquisitions, trademarks, tax law bankruptcy, employment, securities, real estate or international commercial law.

What it is:
 An ultra-skinny eyeliner with the same amazing glide and payoff as the award-winning Highliner Gel Eye Crayon.

What it does:
 Create a wide-eyed look with Marc Jacobs Beauty’s Fineliner Ultra-Skinny Gel Eye Crayon. It captures the ease and glide of the award-winning Highliner Gel Eye Crayon in a revolutionary ultra-thin, two millimeter, unbreakable tip. Featuring a transformative gel formula, it glides on precisely for flawless application and sets in place for all-day wear. With its precise, malleable tip, Fineliner is ideal for tightlining and lining the waterline with easeand with its waterproof wear, it lasts.

What it is formulated WITHOUT:
- Parabens
- Sulfates
- Phthalates

What else you need to know:
 The slim, striped design of the eyeliner's case was inspired by a Marc Jacobs Collection dress.



Suggested Usage:
 Artistry tips:
-Line the waterline.
-Use Fineliner in (Big)eyes! Start outward and work your way toward the inner corner; then go back over the waterline for an eye-opening look. 

Tightline:
-Use Fineliner in Blacquer to tightline: Place Fineliner in between the top lashes, depositing more color between the roots of the lashes to create the illusion of a thicker, fuller lash line.

Create a refined liner look:
-To create a refined liner look with Fineliner, simply apply with short strokes, starting from the outer corner of the eye and working inward. 
-Glide Fineliner back over the line if you need to.









        Celebrated fashion designer Marc Jacobs showed his first collection in 1986, instantly inspiring women to push boundaries and create their own style. His latest creation, Marc Jacobs Beauty, is a revolutionary mix of innovative formulas, indulgent textures and next-generation performance. Discover luxury reinvented.
