History
Aerosonic has been in operation continuously since 1953.  The company founder, Herbert J. Frank was a Metallurgist, Engineer, Inventor, Entrepreneur and Pilot. Mr. Frank passed away in 1995 but many of the products he created are still in production today. 
Starting as a small manufacturing company in Clearwater Florida, the operation has grown into a key supplier of precision aircraft products to all aspects of the military and civil aviation market.
The company was founded on the insistence of high quality and the development of practical solutions to customer needs. These two simple principles continue to guide the company today.
In 1993 Aerosonic acquired Avionics Specialties Inc. from Teledyne Corporation. This acquisition added new customers, products, processes and talent to the organization. Our product line grew to include Angle of Attack Sensors, Stall Warning Systems and Integrated Multifunction Probes. 
With the move of the industry toward more digitally based products Aerosonic capitalized on the increased capability of the company to further develop the product offerings.  A significant investment in engineering resulted in developing air data expertise that serves as a link between several products such as probes, displays and digital instruments.
Beyond today and into the future, Aerosonic’s strategic vision is to partner with customers to leverage unique strengths and capabilities to develop solutions that are both innovative and practical.
