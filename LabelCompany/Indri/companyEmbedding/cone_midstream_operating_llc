CONE Midstream Reports Strong Fourth Quarter Results

Feb 26, 2015, 07:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   CONE Midstream Partners LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


CANONSBURG, Pa., Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- CONE Midstream Partners LP (NYSE:  CNNX) ("CONE Midstream" or the "Partnership") today reported financial and operational results for the three months ending December 31, 2014.(1)  The Partnership also provided an update on throughput volumes and announced financial guidance for 2015.
Fourth Quarter Results
Highlights of fourth quarter 2014 results attributable to the Partnership include:

Net income of $15.3 million 
Average daily throughput volumes of 545 billion Btu per day (BBtu/d) 
EBITDA(2) of $16.6 million 
Distributable cash flow (DCF)(2) of $14.8 million
Operational Update
Total throughput volumes for the development companies operated and controlled by CONE Midstream reached the one billion cubic feet per day equivalent milestone on January 1, 2015. Total throughput volumes attributable to the Partnership averaged 562 million cubic feet per day equivalent for the month of January 2015.
Management Comment
"Strong volume growth on the Anchor Systems drove our good results for the fourth quarter," said John T. Lewis, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of CONE Midstream GP LLC (the "General Partner").  "Fourth quarter throughput, EBITDA and DCF all exceeded the forecast amounts anticipated in the prospectus for the Partnership's initial public offering.
"We are pleased to have hit the one billion cubic feet per day throughput threshold approximately six months earlier than we had projected," continued Mr. Lewis.  "The early achievement of this milestone is a testimony to the hard work of our employees in building and operating our pipeline systems, the execution of drilling and production operations by our Sponsors, CONSOL Energy and Noble Energy, and the strong performance of the wells we are connecting to our systems."
Quarterly Distribution
As previously announced, the Board of Directors of the General Partner declared an initial quarterly cash distribution of $0.2148 per unit with respect to the period commencing on September 30, 2014 (the closing date of the Partnership's initial public offering) through December 31, 2014.  This prorated amount corresponds to the Partnership's minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2125 per unit adjusted for the number of days in the period.  The distribution payment was made on February 13, 2015 to unitholders of record on February 4, 2015.
Capital Investment and Resources
CONE Midstream's allocated fourth quarter 2014 share of investment in expansion projects was $17.0 million. Total expansion capital investment at the three development companies in which CONE Midstream holds controlling interests was $81.2 million, with individual development company totals as follows:

Anchor Systems (Development Company 1): Expansion investments totaled $18.5 million and were primarily expended for continued expansion of the Majorsville and McQuay gathering systems, increased stabilization capacity in the Majorsville field, and expansion of compression capacity at McQuay Station. 
Growth Systems (Development Company 2): Expansion investments totaled $22.3 million and primarily were expended for the connection of two well pads in Barbour County (WV), connection of one well pad in Lewis County, and permitting and land work related to the Tygart Valley gathering system. 
Additional Systems (Development Company 3): Expansion investments totaled $40.5 million and supported new production from the Oxford and Shirley systems and projects in the Pennsboro, Moundsville and ACAA project areas that are anticipated to result in wet gas volume throughput growth in 2015.
CONE Midstream's respective share of maintenance capital expenditures for the three development companies for fourth quarter 2014 was $1.8 million.  Maintenance capital expenditures in the aggregate for the development companies in which CONE Midstream holds controlling interests totaled $2.8 million.
As of December 31, 2014,  CONE Midstream had outstanding borrowings of $31.3 million under its $250 million revolving credit facility.
2015 Guidance
Based on current expectations, management is providing the following guidance for 2015. Full year 2015 EBITDA attributable to the Partnership is expected to be in the range of $62 - $70 million and full year Distributable Cash Flow attributable to the Partnership is expected to be in the range of $50 - $60 million. Management currently anticipates that total 2015 capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership will be in the range of $95 to $115 million, of which approximately $8 to $10 million will be for maintenance capital.    Capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership by development company are projected as follows:

_______________
(1)    Unless otherwise indicated, the reporting measures included in this news release reflect the unallocated total activity of the three development companies jointly owned by the Partnership and CONE Gathering LLC ("CONE Gathering").  Because the Partnership owns a controlling interest in each of the three development companies, it fully consolidates their financial results. The Partnership's current financial interests in the development companies are: 75% in the Anchor Systems, 5% in the Growth Systems, and 5% in the Additional Systems.  CONE Gathering is a midstream joint venture formed by CONSOL Energy Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc. and owns non-controlling interests in the Partnership's development companies.

CONE MIDSTREAM PARTNERS LP 
RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA AND DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW 
(in thousands) 
(unaudited)
Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
EBITDA
We define EBITDA as net income before income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization.  EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:

our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure; 
the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners; 
our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
We believe that the presentation of EBITDA provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.  The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities.  EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies.  As a result, EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Distributable Cash Flow
We define distributable cash flow as EBITDA less net cash interest paid and maintenance capital expenditures.  Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances.
Distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:

the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions to our unitholders; and 
the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.
We believe that the presentation of distributable cash flow in this report provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations.  The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities.  Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies.  As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
The partnership does not provide financial guidance for projected net income or changes in working capital, and, therefore, is unable to provide a reconciliation of its adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow projections to net income, operating income, or net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

Management Comment

                                        








"Our fourth quarter capped another year of growth and strong financial and operating performance for CONE Midstream," said John T. Lewis, Chief Executive Officer of CONE Midstream GP LLC (the "General Partner").  "For the full year 2016, CNNX reported a 35% increase in net income, a 38% increase in net cash provided by operating activities, a 38% increase in Adjusted EBITDA over 2015 results, and distributable cash flow for the year grew by 36%.  Our cash distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of $0.2724 per unit represents a 15.3% increase over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015.


                                        








"In addition, the quarter saw two significant events for CONE," continued Mr. Lewis.  "We completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in the Anchor Systems, which will provide additional support for distribution growth for the future.  Also, our Sponsors announced and closed a transaction to separate their upstream joint venture, allowing each Sponsor to have more flexibility in the timing and pace of development."


                                        








Quarterly Distribution

                                        








As previously announced, the Board of Directors of the General Partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.2724 per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of 2016.  The distribution payment was made on February 14, 2017 to unitholders of record on February 6, 2017.  The distribution, which equates to an annual rate of $1.0896 per unit, represents an increase of 3.6% over the third quarter of 2016 and an increase of 15.3% over the distribution paid with respect to the fourth quarter of 2015.


                                        








Capital Investment and Resources

                                        








CONE Midstream's allocated fourth quarter 2016 share of investment in expansion projects was $4.8 million. Total expansion capital investment at the three development companies in which CONE Midstream holds controlling interests was $4.9 million.  CONE Midstream's respective share of maintenance capital expenditures for the three development companies for fourth quarter 2016 was $3.8 million.  Maintenance capital expenditures in the aggregate for the development companies in which CONE Midstream holds controlling interests totaled $5.3 million.


                                        








As of December 31, 2016, CONE Midstream had outstanding borrowings of $167 million under its $250 million revolving credit facility.


                                        








2017 Guidance

                                        








Based on current expectations, management is providing the following guidance for 2017. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA
		[(2)]
	 attributable to the Partnership is expected to be in the range of $128 to $138 million and full year distributable cash flow
		[(2)]
	 attributable to the Partnership is expected to be in the range of $105 to $115 million. Management currently anticipates that 2017 capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership will be in the range of $65 to $75 million, of which approximately $17 to $18 million will be for maintenance capital.


                                        








CONE Midstream's financial guidance is based on numerous assumptions about future events and conditions and, therefore, could vary materially from actual results. These estimates, including capital expenditure plans, are meant to provide guidance only and are subject to revision for acquisitions or operating environment changes.

	Unless otherwise indicated, the reporting measures included in this news release reflect the unallocated total activity of the three development companies that have been jointly owned by the Partnership and CONE Gathering LLC ("CONE Gathering") since completion of the Partnership's initial public offering ("IPO") in September 2014.  Effective November 16, 2016, the Partnership acquired the remaining 25% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems, which brought its controlling interest in that system to 100%.  The Partnership's current financial interests in the development companies are: 100% in the Anchor Systems, 5% in the Growth Systems, and 5% in the Additional Systems.  Because the Partnership owns a controlling interest in each of the three development companies, it fully consolidates their financial results.  CONE Gathering is a midstream joint venture formed by CONSOL Energy Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc. that continues to own noncontrolling interests in two of the Partnership's development companies.

Brokers and nominees should treat one hundred percent (100.0%) of CONE Midstream's distributions to non-U.S. investors as being attributed to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.  Accordingly, CONE Midstream's distributions to non-U.S. investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate.  Nominees, and not CONE Midstream, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding on the distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.  Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include the words "will," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "estimate" and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to historical matters identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that actual outcomes and results will not differ materially from those expected by our management.  You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

                                        








Although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs at the time they are made, they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.  For more information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those conveyed in the forward-looking statements, including, among others, that our business plans may change as circumstances warrant, please refer to the "Risk Factors" and "Forward-Looking Statements" sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise, unless required by law.

Definition of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

                                        








EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

                                        








We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash items which should not be included in the calculation of distributable cash flow. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:


                                        










our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure;        











the ability of our assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to our partners;        











our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and        











the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.        











We believe that the presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides information that is useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.


                                        








Distributable Cash Flow

                                        








We define distributable cash flow as Adjusted EBITDA less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, net cash interest paid and maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable cash flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances.


                                        








Distributable cash flow is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, industry analysts, lenders and ratings agencies, to assess:


                                        










the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to support our indebtedness and make future cash distributions to our unitholders; and        











the attractiveness of capital projects and acquisitions and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.        











We believe that the presentation of distributable cash flow in this release provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP.  Distributable cash flow excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or net cash, and these measures may vary from those of other companies. As a result, our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit.

Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
