The Colmen Group - James C. Hellauer





































































Mr. Hellauer was a
                pioneer in introducing the concept of a non-employee CEO/COO and has successfully
                implemented this model in several assignments."






James C. Hellauer
Executive Director

Companies get themselves into trouble because they lose
                their focus. And more times than not, they lose their focus because they stop
                communicating, both internally with their staff, and externally with their customers,
                vendors and lenders. Colmen understands how to rebuild these vital communication links as
                part of our overall ability to help clients fix their problems.

                James Hellauer specializes in providing management services to emerging and troubled
                companies in the middle market. He has over thirty-eight (38) years of senior management
                experience in a wide range of manufacturing, distribution and service industries in the
                capacity of Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Advisor, Member
                of the Board of Directors or Shareholder. For the past fifteen years, Mr. Hellauer has
                focused on assisting, advising, and implementing reorganizations, restructurings,
                turnarounds, sales, debt financings, and operations improvement programs for a variety of
                organizations. 

                Mr. Hellauer was an early advocate of active involvement by outside Board members. He has
                served, or is currently serving, on four public company Boards of Directors and over a
                dozen private company Boards.

                During his career, Mr. Hellauer has had leadership roles in a number of important
                endeavors. Some of his accomplishments include:

Initiation and direction of a successful IPO of a Financial Services
                    Company 
Conceptualization, negotiation and implementation of a leverage
                    purchase of a special chemical company 
Initiation and completion of acquisitions and/or divestitures of four
                    companies 
Obtaining debt and equity funding where necessary 
Increasing shareholder value in every assignment 

He was also a pioneer in introducing the concept of a non-employee
                CEO/COO and has successfully implemented this model in several assignments. By utilizing
                this method, the consultant becomes an integral part of the management team with the
                authority to effect change, yet he is unencumbered by past policies and procedures.

                Mr. Hellauer holds a BS degree from the U.S. Naval Academy and an MBA from Harvard
                University.

 Bio 
James Hellauer specializes in providing management services to emerging and troubled companies in the middle market. He has over thirty-eight (38) years of senior management experience in a wide range of manufacturing, distribution and service industries in the capacity of Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Advisor, Member of the Board of Directors or Shareholder. For the past fifteen years, Mr. Hellauer has focused on assisting, advising, and implementing reorganizations, restructurings, turnarounds, sales, debt financings, and operations improvement programs for a variety of organizations. Mr. Hellauer was an early advocate of active involvement by outside Board members. He has served, or is currently serving, on four public company Boards of Directors and over a dozen private company Boards. He was also a pioneer in introducing the concept of a non-employee CEO/COO and has successfully implemented this model in several assignments. By utilizing this method, the consultant becomes an integral part of the management team with the authority to effect change, yet he is unencumbered by past policies and procedures. Mr. Hellauer holds a BS degree from the U.S. Naval Academy and an MBA from Harvard University.

Tasty Baking Company Shareholders Elect Board Members at Annual Meeting; Company Declares Regular Quarterly Cash Dividend; James C. Hellauer and James E. Nevels Newly Elected to Tasty's Board of Directors






May 12, 2005 03:12 PM Eastern Daylight Time



				PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 12, 2005--Tasty Baking Company (NYSE:TBC) announced that shareholders approved the company's nominees to its Board of Directors at its annual meeting of shareholders on May 12, 2005. The following directors were elected for the first time for a term expiring in 2008:  -- James C. Hellauer, 66, is the Executive Director of the Colmen Group, a consulting company which provides management services to middle market companies. Hellauer is also a director of PMA Capital Corporation, a property and casualty holding company.  -- James E. Nevels, 53, is the Chairman of The Swarthmore Group, an independent registered investment advisor. Nevels is also Chairman of the Philadelphia School Reform Commission, which has been charged with overseeing the turnaround of the Philadelphia School System. He also currently serves as a member of the Board of Berea College, the Board of Directors of the Association of Governing Boards and Colleges and Universities; the Board of Visitors, Temple University-Fox School of Business and Management; and the Board of Overseers of the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Last year Nevels was appointed to serve on the Advisory Committee to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.  Reelected at the meeting was Fred C. Aldridge, 72, who has served on the Tasty Board since 1981. Retired as a partner from the Philadelphia law firm of Stradley, Ronon, Stevens & Young, LLP, Aldridge is President of The Grace S. and W. Linton Nelson Foundation, a charitable foundation, and Vice President/Special Counsel to the Independent Trustees/Directors of each of the Funds in the Delaware Investments Family of Funds.  Hellauer, Nevels and Aldridge join the following Directors:  -- James E. Ksansnak, Chairman of Tasty Baking Company and retired Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of ARAMARK.  -- Ronald J. Kozich, retired Managing Partner of Ernst & Young.  -- Charles P. Pizzi, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tasty Baking Company.  -- Judith M. von Seldeneck, Chairman of Diversified Search, Inc.  -- David J. West, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Hershey Foods Corp.  Commenting on Hellauer's and Nevel's election, James Ksansnak, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tasty Baking Company, said, "We look forward to having James Hellauer and James Nevels on our Board as both individuals have a deep understanding of the pillars of our Strategic Transformation Plan and the steps that are required to execute against that plan. They will be joining a Board that has already provided significant insight as we continue our focus to drive long-term shareholder value."  Philip J. Baur, Jr., whose term expired in 2007, was elected Director Emeritus by the Board following his announcement to retire. Mr. Baur served on the Board of Directors since 1954 and held various positions with the Company, including Chairman of the Board. Upon his retirement, the Board will now be composed of eight members, not including the Director Emeritus position.  At the meeting, shareholders also ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as independent auditors for 2005. A proposal to amend the Company's 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available for grants under this Plan was not approved by the shareholders.  Tasty Baking Company also announced that its Board of Directors, at its meeting on May 12, 2005, declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share on all outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend is payable June 1, 2005, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 20, 2005.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"
