		  Seven days after the Presidential Election failed to decisively settle on a new Chief Executive, I had a chance to enjoy an extended chat with Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys, Inc. We sat in his office in Mountain View and discussed presidential politics, the Electoral College, and his long career in EDA. Now, two months later, a new American President has been inaugurated and I finally finish this article about Aart. Projects like this don't normally take two months, but on that fateful day last November  moments after I left Synopsys  I managed to drive my car under a truck headed East on 237 in heavy, late-afternoon traffic. For some reason, the drama and aftermath of the accident became an impediment to writing this and now that the article's done, it must mean that the accident is finally over.


Aart de Geus is an interesting man. Many people have heard him speak, know his story and company well, and some have even had the good fortune to hear him play the guitar. I, however, had never had a long visit with Aart, so it was an hour  (and a half) well-spent talking with him. 


The last two months have offered living proof that the American political system can survive a convoluted and unprecedented post-election process. Aart de Geus offers a different kind of living proof  the proof that a man well-steeped in technology can successfully found, fund, and follow-into-hugeness a high-tech start-up despite folk wisdom to the contrary  that start-ups require one kind of leader for the $0 to $50 million annual revenue range, a different kind of leader for $50 million to $500 million, and yet a third kind of leader for the $500 million range and beyond. Aart has, authentically, done it all. He's grown Synopsys all the way from its infancy up to its current size today of over $600 million in annual revenue.


In fact, the infancy-to-adulthood analogy is exactly how de Geus describes the history of his company, which prompted a question from me. I asked Aart if the technology folks that hail from Northern Europe seem to be particularly gifted in the art of humor and whimsy. I reminded him that his DAC'99 keynote, "System on a Ship," comparing the rigors of Columbus' voyage with today's adventures into "System on a Chip" was matched in whimsy by Hugo de Mann's keynote at DAC'00  de Mann being from Belgium, de Geus from The Netherlands. Aart declined the compliment and said he didn't know much about the art of humor, but he relies heavily on the art of analogy to get a point across. In the case of a company's development, Aart believes that  just as in human life  there is a beginning, a childhood, an adolescence, and an adulthood. 


Europe and The West


Aart's own life began in The Netherlands. At the age of 4, his family moved to Lake Geneva in Switzerland. After 10 years living and attending school in the French-speaking region of Switzerland, the family moved to Switzerland's Basal-en-Main where Aart spent his adolescence studying in German. Aart's distinctly multi-lingual  particularly impressive when you consider that after university in Europe, he came to the United States to continue his graduate work in Electrical Engineering at Southern Methodist University in Texas and studied in yet a third language, English. 


Aart says Europeans that come to North America are on a quest: "Everybody from Europe who comes to the U.S. or Canada is looking to discover something." In his case, he discovered a "stroke of luck" in being assigned as a graduate student to Ron Rohrer at SMU.  "He took a liking to me," Aart says, which was fortuitous considering that not only was Rohrer his graduate advisor, but also dean, chairman of the department, and provost of the university. Aart gives Rohrer attribution as the father of Spice in that he developed the Cancer program for circuit analysis for networks. (projects.openresources.com/libresoft-notes/libresoft-notes-en/node88.html )


"Rohrer essentially gave me the freedom to do whatever I wanted" within the graduate school research facilities, according to Aart. At that time, Texas Instruments had just donated 10 microprocessors to SMU, each with 16 kbytes of memory. Aart managed to put together a course in EE that had 10 graduate students developing "fun" teaching programs on the microprocessors. The programs displayed logic on the screen and allowed the students to discover what the logic would do.  The project developed into one of the core classes in EE at SMU.


Aart took several lessons away from this experience. He developed an ability to manage a set of students, skills that he later capitalized on to develop his management style. To describe that style, Aart uses a farming analogy: Everybody counts on the [farming] team and there's always a role for everybody, which produces an ecosystem that manages itself. A self-sufficient farm suggests a self-sufficient company.


Meanwhile Rohrer was back at his home in Virginia. He suggested that Aart come and stay with him and his family  a time-honored tradition, per Aart, that hails back to the time of Socrates when a student spent time living with his teacher. Aart made the trip to Virginia and ended up working nearby at General Electric in North Carolina developing a group committed to tool development  an effort that ended up relegating Aart's graduate studies to "the night hours."


At GE, Aart worked on tools that designed logic with multiplexors that included much more efficient logic. He decided to develop gate arrays with mixed logic and multiplexors, an effort that coordinated with GE's move into the gate-array business. "Nobody in his right mind wanted to design with multiplexors," Aart says, so it was decided to write a program to solve the problem. "It was only much later that we started to look at papers [in the area] being presented at the time." Aart and his group eventually realized that there was already 20 years of research that had been done on synthesis  "all of which I knew nothing about," he says.


Aart began to assemble a team at GE, starting with one open requisition for an entry-level manager. In the first summer he was permitted to hire one student. In the second summer, he was allotted three students. By the third summer at GE, his group had grown to 23 students. In that third summer, GE discovered that all of these students needed cubicles, and so forth, even though they were effectively earning minimum wage.


Aart explained that in 1985, "GE decided to get out of the semiconductor business. It had never quite worked for them. So, I started interviewing in Silicon Valley. But, the team we [already] had was as qualified in tools as we could find here." So Aart asked his team, "Why don't we take the synthesis [problem] and see what we can do with it." 


How do you do that? First, you write a business plan. Then, you ask, is it ethical? Is it okay to do that? How do you go about planning the business so as not to go up against GE? Well, according to Aart, there's a simple answer. You write a business plan and propose it to GE. After all, it was clearly their IP. Period.


So, "a couple of us put together a business plan to present to the board of the general manager." The GM liked business plan and Aart & Company were successful. Based on that meeting, GE decided they would put a significant equity stake into the enterprise. "If we did well, they would benefit. I had a chance to present to Ed Hood, who was second in command at GE at the time. I had one hour to present the plan. Support for the business was predicated on raising another $5 million on our own." Hood was obviously swayed in their favor. The group received $1 million from GE and returned to Silicon Valley to raise the rest, convinced that raising the rest of the capital was "clearly going to be a piece of cake." 


They first received $1 million from Harris Semiconductor  which represented a magic conjunction between people who knew the technology and those who knew how to work with GE. Then, they got a $250,000 loan form GE, above and beyond the initial investment. Aart says that, in hindsight, he "shudders to think that I didn't realize that we would have to pay it back!"


The Map as Dart Board


Soon thereafter, the business was up and running. They knew they were underway when they managed to sell one copy of their CAD tool to Harris Semiconductor. Aart gives credit where credit is due: "The fact is that Harris was incredibly supportive." By September of 1987, Aart & Company had indeed finished raising the requisite $5 million, which he says wryly was "a great deal of money in those days."


Now they had to decide whether to house the company in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park, on Route 128 outside of Boston, or in Silicon Valley in California. Most of his team was fresh out of graduate school, so everything that they owned could fit into the trunk of a car. Subsequently, he only lost one member of the team when he decided to settle the company in California. "I alone had a mortgage or a loan," Aart adds, which explains why the move was probably hardest for him.


Here in Silicon Valley, Aart and his team had access to a wealth of intellect from U.C. Berkeley and Stanford, an array of relevant legal talent, venture capital input, and entrepreneur camaraderie. They took occupancy of their Silicon Valley offices in October of 1987 and promptly started trolling for additional staff with which to build the company. Harvey Jones was recruited as president, having previously served as CEO of Daisy. Harvey brought much needed marketing and sales expertise to the young enterprise. Aart & Company made their first appearance at DAC (the Design Automation Conference) in June of 1988, where they formally introduced their product for the first time.


I asked Aart if he felt lucky about this string of events that lead up to the start of Synopsys. He responded, "Luck favors the well prepared," and added that a fortuitous combination of management, graduate students, geographic location, viable business plan, and marketing expertise were augmented by having the "right technology at the right time. It was an era where schematic entry was beginning to taper off, and the age of RTL simulation beginning. We teamed up with Gateway and their simulator. All of these things worked to our advantage." 


Aart de Geus is a meticulous technologist, so this fortuitous combination  like luck  may have been nothing more than the apparent reward for the well prepared. It's hard to dispute his telling of the history when you look at the fact that, by all reports, Synopsys has owned the lion's share of the synthesis market for a decade now. In many ways, you could argue their product has been synonymous with the term synthesis in the design flow.


But, Aart says that a company like Synopsys can suffer from being so closely identified with one part of the design flow. Important as synthesis may be, there's always the concern that "You're just a one-trick pony." I asked him what that means. He said, you ask the pony if he can do a new trick. The pony replies, "Nope. I want to do the old trick." So you have to convince the pony to expand its horizons, to expand its growth. He feels Synopsys has managed to do that; now [only] one-third of the company is involved with the synthesis tools, while the remainder of the company has been given more bandwidth.


Returning to the tutorial value of analogy, Aart explains that in the years since its inception, Synopsys has progressed through the stages of baby, toddler, adolescent  earning it's driver's license replete with the "nervous mom" standing by  and on into adulthood. In fact, Aart says that the company has had two main phases in its growth, during which it was effectively two different companies  the pre-IPO Synopsys and the post-IPO Synopsys.


He reports with pride that, today, Synopsys has over 3000 employees across multiple sites, and includes among their two largest acquisitions, the purchases of EPIC and Viewlogic. He qualifies the statement: 40% of Viewlogic came to Synopsys, while the Board Systems Division ended up being at Innoveda. In essence, according to Aart, Synopsys has had a very steady, albeit fortuitous, growth over its history. 


Reality Check


Today, there are multiple business units in the company  some of which have endured merger and acquisition dynamics  and all of which have faced the challenge of meeting real-world customer problems. Recently, an additional challenge has emerged  the transition to the new licensing model that is sweeping through EDA. 


"We're not lacking in ideas in what we can do. As this became clearer and clearer, it became more obvious that the business model was flawed. Selling something once [to the customer] and then [selling them] trickle-purchase updates [was not working]," according to Aart. Instead, he says, "The 'rental model' is where we need to be with a recurring revenue stream." 


The analogies continue: "If the landlord doesn't attend to the plumbing in the apartment, we will move. Therefore, making that design [work for engineers] is where the challenge lies [in EDA]." 


Aart acknowledges that, financially, it's been difficult for the company to make the transition to the new licensing model. Synopsys made the transition "cold turkey" and the accountants "loved" the transition, he says with irony. Investors saw $229 million in revenue last quarter (Q3 2000) move to a projected quarterly revenue of $125 million for Q4. But "once you do it," according to Aart, within 18 months you can expect to see the revenue numbers stablize and then reflect the accurate growth of the company. Like many in EDA, he is convinced that, overall, it will help the industry to make this transition.


"I do believe that an industry, like a company, goes through a maturation process. In particular, adolescence to adulthood. You start to behave in a more constructive way. The whole industry depends on each company doing well. [We're seeing] a natural growth for this industry. In some industries, the companies [compete] each other to death. But, my sense it that for EDA, everyone in EDA will do better [with the new business models]."


As far as market share is concerned, Aart addressed the oft-stated conundrum in EDA: a part of a limited pie or grow the pie. He argues that it's the pricing scheme in the industry that does significant damage to EDA. "You'll do a lot of discounting to make your quarterly numbers. [But it shouldn't be] just willy-nilly. In fact, competitive pricing is better for all of the other companies as well. Therefore, removing that [fixed pricing model] makes the whole industry healthier." 


I asked: "Does that mean the EDA industry is not healthy?"


Aart replied, "It does not" 


Good.


How about the perception that Venture Capital wants too much control of a young company? 


Aart says, "Strong teams with good products don't need to give their souls away to 'evil' VCs. [The team] can establish the ratio of who owns what. And, if they don't like it, [the VCs] can move on. 30% to 50% of capital should be devoted [to further development] of the company. After all, having a large share of a loser is not the way Venture Capitalists make money. They make their money by having their share of a great winner. VCs have no time. Their ideal situation is a company that does well and one where they don't even have to attend the board meetings." Aart added: "But, my experience may not be the norm." 


Is Synopsys assisting small companies these days? "Synopsys has a small investment fund and we are involved in helping start-ups which are involved in technologies peripheral to where we are."


Whimsy Central


Aart again insists that he's not trying to be whimsical when he uses an analogy to clarify what someone is trying to say, and using fairly few characterizations.


For instance: "The DNA of a company is the actual behavior that reflects how they feel about themselves. They can be bullish or defensive. I would argue that [for the] long term survival [of a company], childhood diseases and other ups and downs are [important for] companies that are very successful. If one is unprepared  if you've never seen an earthquake  then you never secured the water heater in the basement. GE, HP are companies that are in a different league [because they knew how to be prepared]."


I asked him to explain, however, how companies can stay innovative as they grow to the size of GE and HP.


"If you make it [as a company], then you need a portion that is new and fresh and a portion that is battle-hardened that knows why you're there. [It's the same] with your own kids; you let them take some risk. In terms of a company that [translates to] the creative management of chaos."


How does Synopsys continue to grow?


"We're already very interactive in the U.S., and in Europe we have three or four centers  as well as operations in Bangalore, India. The company has a network of management, local-engineering managers, and product groups [there]. We're developing Design Sphere for the use of tools over the Internet. The thing is still in its infancy, but geography can be partly removed electronically. One can then work where the business is not and certain tasks can be done [remotely]. This thinking is [also] in its infancy. [It will lead to] an increased [design] bandwidth on a worldwide basis. The  infrastructure [of the Internet] is incredibly powerful."


Getting Away from It All


In talking to Aart, the impression is strong: His life is, in many ways, synonymous with the life of the company. I asked Aart if he's ever able to get away from it all. He does play the blues guitar and, on rare occasion, is able to pursue his oil painting.


But, not surprisingly, he says the company requires virtually all of his "mental attention. Not a day [goes by], when I don't think about a challenge, an issue, or an opportunity [related to Synopsys]. The issue in not going home at 5 PM. The more difficult challenge [is to leave it behind].


Subsequently, Aart has just been subjected to a Daddy Performance Review. His 8-year-old gave him a low score  somewhere around a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The 5-year-old, not wanting to be overshadowed by the first reviewer, gave Aart a 1000  tentatively hoping that this score also falls somewhere between a 5 and a 10. Aart's pretty convinced that performance reviews depend on the guy giving the review.


Reviews, or no reviews, Aart's sure that "you always need a common vision for what you want to achieve. It's important along with the work environment, the salary, the upside potential for everyone, [as well as] the people you work with and what they do." He's clearly proud that "Synopsys has had a large impact  there's virtually no sophisticated chip today that's not been designed with Synopsys [tools]." And, he's clearly even more proud that "Our people are excellent." 


Aart appears to simultaneously celebrate and lament the fact that, today, designers are fully aware that "what can be fabricated is more than what can be designed. Clearly, the level of investment needed to sustain design at Moore's rate is enormous." With Aart leading the call for additional funding for EDA, the industry may very well continue to hope for the best.

Sections:Drop it off a cliffStormy MondayJewel and dirt ballTwo in the boxScrew-upsLessons from the farmListening to customersWeb exclusive: Avant!/Cadence battle is finally over











 


Aart de Geus, co-founder, chairman and CEO for Synopsys Inc., and lead guitarist of Silicon Valley's Full Disclosure Blues Band


 


 


 


 


 


Lead guitar players are notorious ego-maniacs but not Aart de Geus, lead guitarist of Silicon Valley's Full Disclosure Blues Band. "Whenever I play with Aart, he's part of the whole," says bass player Gary Smith. "Once we get the rhythms down, the breaks down, Aart says, 'Okay guys, now let's play together.' He has us practice in a circle so we can watch each other."

Like the other five band members, de Geus has a day job. He's co-founder, chairman and CEO of Synopsys Inc., Mountain View, CA, an electronic design automation (EDA) software developer that changed the EDA landscape this year with its acquisition of Avant! Corp., Fremont, CA. For this and many other reasons, ELECTRONIC BUSINESS selects de Geus as its CEO of the Year for 2002.
De Geus (pronounced de-GEE-us) is a top-flight technologist who has become an astute businessman with a consensus management style. He's a champion for learning—for himself, his employees and Silicon Valley youth. With his passion for technology and widely applauded integrity, de Geus has become a senior statesman in the under-appreciated EDA industry.
Analysts praise the Avant! deal, which makes Synopsys the second billion-dollar EDA company, pitting it against No. 1, Cadence Design Systems Inc., San Jose. "I expect Synopsys to be No. 1 in a couple of years," says Smith, whose day job is EDA analyst for the Dataquest division of Gartner Inc., Stamford, CT. "A $5-billion company is not out of the realm of possible."

The merger, however, is fraught with potential peril. De Geus must orchestrate the integration of two vastly different cultures. Synopsys is ethical and consensus oriented. Avant! was autocratic and tainted by criminal and civil charges that it stole intellectual property (IP) from Cadence. Observers say de Geus is up to the challenge of this merger and to leading Synopsys to multi-billion-dollar revenues.

Drop it off a cliff

De Geus learned his first guitar licks at 14, inspired by the Chicago-style blues of T Bone Walker. He was born in Holland and reared in Switzerland, where he played in the Black Cat Bone Blues Band for 10 years. Now 48, he has little time for music. He plays at home in Los Altos Hills, once a year with Full Disclosure and an occasional jam. The band, however, is an important metaphor.


"In a band, the key skill is listening," de Geus says. "Most people think skill on the instrument is key. That's important, but listening to others and how you play together is more important. A good band also learns to deal with individual egos. Much of the management style at Synopsys is like that band model."

Grant Pierce, a Full Disclosure member and CEO at Sonics Inc., Mountain View, agrees: "Aart listens, which is extremely valuable in music and management. He understands how to give space and take space in the process of collaboration and looks for complements to his own skills."





"In a band, THE KEY SKILL IS LISTENING. A good band also learns to deal with individual egos. Much of the management syle at Synopsys is like that band model."
—Aart de Geus, chairman and CEO, Synopsys Inc.


Smith tells a story that makes the same point. The band's signature "Stormy Monday" features a raucous de Geus solo. At practice before a gig earlier this year, de Geus suggested a dramatic effect at the expense of his solo. "He said, 'Why don't we take it from this break and drop it off a cliff.'" Translation: Cut the volume from loud to soft.


"When you're rocking hard, it's hard to go off the cliff at the same time," says Smith. At the gig, the musicians followed de Geus's lead and did fine. "The rhythm was very low and you could hardly hear the guitar solo. I got the chills. I think Aart did, too."

Stormy Monday

On Monday, Dec. 3, 2001, northern California was reeling from a storm that caused floods and power outages. On this stormy Monday, Synopsys dropped the news that it would acquire Avant! for stock worth about $775 million. A pessimist might have seen a bad omen in the timing.

Six months earlier, Avant! founder Gerry Hsu and six other executives pleaded no contest to charges of stealing Cadence IP and using it in their early place-and-route products. Some of the executives went to jail. In mid-November, Cadence agreed to accept $265 million to settle the civil suit (see our Web-exclusive story Avant!/Cadence battle is finally over).

Synosys and Avant! couldn't be more different. Synopsys manages by consensus; Avant! by fiat. The 2,500 Synopsys employees are encouraged to take risks. The 1,500 Avant! employees were ordered to do as they were told. Synopsys has a reputation for integrity. Avant! had a reputation for, uh, being criminal. It isn't far-fetched to compare the integration of the two to the merging of the two Germanys.

"Most engineers are going to be way more comfortable at Synopsys than at Avant!," says Joe Costello, CEO at think3 Inc., Santa Clara, CA, and the former Cadence CEO who sued Avant!. "But culture permeates a company so deeply in so many ways. It is history, practices, customer relationships, etc. It is amazing how hard culture is to eradicate."

"We wrestled with the acquisition of Avant! for three or four years. Aart was always against it because of the integrity issue," says Steven Walske, a Synopsys board member since 1991. "We decided not to pursue it. It was not just the ethics, but it was more expensive then." Synopsys opted to build its own back-end tools, but found it difficult.

Jewel and dirt ball

After the criminal case, the executives were gone and the tainted company cost less. "We started another round of discussions," says Walske. "The board's major consideration was to make sure we had a plan to mitigate the negatives."


CFO Brad Henske suggested insurance to cover the civil suit. "Avant! was a big jewel with a dirt ball on it," he says. He negotiated a policy, with a $300-million-plus premium, signed on Dec. 3, 2001. The insurer is paying the $265 million to Cadence.

Avant! gives Synopsys a complete IC design solution. It's widely used back-end place-and-route, analysis and extraction tools complement Synopsys' leading front-end synthesis tools. "We can go to the customer with a bigger value proposition," de Geus says (see ELECTRONIC BUSINESS, "Design Duopoly," June 2002).




Together their 2001 sales were $1.08 billion, putting Synopsys in a position to challenge Cadence, whose 2001 sales were $1.4 billion (see pie chart above). "Synopsys [with] Avant! is extraordinarily powerful," says Bill Frerichs, an equity analyst for D.A. Davidson & Co., Portland, OR. "I don't expect either [Synopsys or Cadence] to maintain an unbeatable lead over the other over the long term. It's going to be extremely competitive."


And a bigger Synopsys now qualifies for more stock portfolios, Frerichs says. EDA stocks haven't had the wild price fluctuations of other technology stocks. This was to their detriment during the bubble, but serves them well now. Still, Frerichs says, the market doesn't fully appreciate Synopsys: "I'm not sure Wall Street has awakened to what a powerful offering this is."

Two in the box

"Avant! was a bold move," says de Geus. "Especially during this downturn and with their legal stuff." He says integrating the two cultures will take a couple of years and depends on good management. De Geus and his executives revamped their two-day management course that he helps teach. "Every time I teach it, I'm sharpening the ability to voice what we mean by culture and the expectations of management."


De Geus and his executives learned from mistakes with earlier acquisitions, especially the importance of integrating two sales forces. The Avant! deal closed on June 6, 2002. Within a week, they had consolidated the two sales teams. Three weeks later the sales staff met to go over product roadmaps and strategies.

"In a detailed review at the last board meeting, I was amazed at how far they had come," says Andy Bryant, a Synopsys director since 1999 and CFO at Intel Corp., Santa Clara. He credits de Geus for the strategy and President and COO Chi-Foon Chan for the details. "Chi-Foon has done a wonderful job of laying the foundation of trust and cooperation that should allow them to deal with any issues later."




"Aart listens, which is extremely valuable in music and management. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW TO GIVE SPACE AND TAKE SPACE in the process of collaboration and looks for complements to his own skills."
—Grant Pierce, a Full Disclosure member and CEO, Sonics Inc.


Chan, a 12-year Synopsys veteran who once worked for Intel, has been COO for four years. He and de Geus both appear in the same box at the top of the org chart—"two in the box," they call it. Together, they manage 12 direct reports; Chan reports to de Geus. It works. They think of each other as professional soul mates. "We work well together," says Chan. "That doesn't mean we agree on everything. If we do, then I don't have any value to Aart."


"It is a relationship where ideas get developed and mature by a rapid back and forth between us," says de Geus. "Most people don't appreciate how valuable this is."

Screw-ups

De Geus gave a generous three hours over three interviews for this article. Slender with a crop of curly blond hair, he's boyish, enthusiastic and introspective. Earlier in life, he read Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, and did self-analysis with Jungian analysts, which influences him to this day. De Geus scrutinizes de Geus as thoroughly as he does business problems. "As a CEO, it is good to have a certain degree of self doubt. Most of the tough stuff one learns by really screwing up," he says.


He gives employees a wide berth to take risks. "You give a lot if you believe that every person has 100% potential for what they do. Synopsys accepted me as a CEO who had to learn a bunch of things. If you generalize that, then you have a company committed to learning."


His commitment to learning extends beyond Synopsys. In 1999, he founded the Synopsys Silicon Valley Science and Technology Outreach Foundation, Mountain View, to promote project-based science learning in Santa Clara County. Synopsys donates about $800,000 a year for grants to teachers and public schools and for the regional science fair.





As board vice chairman for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, San Jose, de Geus also urges CEOs to participate in a program that gives school teachers paid summer fellowships at electronics companies. Thanks to his efforts, during the worst downturn in decades it placed a record 130 teachers this year, says Carl Guardino, CEO of the group.


De Geus's own learning experiences were diverse. In Switzerland, he became multilingual. He speaks five languages, including impeccable English with a slight accent. Home life with his chemist father was intellectually rigorous. As a child, he wired lamps and electrical switches, but Lego was a stronger lure. "It is a fundamental set of building blocks. I often use the analogy that the modern system on a chip can be brought back to Lego." He still plays with Lego blocks with his two daughters.

Lessons from the farm

He spent boyhood summers on a farm in the Netherlands. "There's a great dependency among the players. Everyone has a role. Even the youngest kids get the eggs. There's no question about whether you would contribute. So often the management problems at Synopsys are not all that different from managing a crew in the field or being a member of a crew."


After high school, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnical Institute where he earned an electrical engineering degree. In 1979, he went to graduate school at Southern Methodist University outside Dallas. "I just wanted to get out of Switzerland. Graduate school was an elegant way to do that."

In 1981, he went to work for General Electric Corp. in Research Triangle Park, NC, developing CAD tools by day and completing his dissertation by night. He hired university students to work with him at GE and soon became a manager. He also met his future wife, Esther, a Swiss student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

In 1985, during a deep industry downturn, GE exited the chip business. "I started to interview for jobs, but saw that my team was as good as some I interviewed with." During his search, he met VC investors who encouraged him to do a spinout. "The synthesis technology we had developed was exciting. But I would not do anything without talking to GE. They had treated us well, and it was their IP. We would make a proposal."


In exchange for equity, GE put up the synthesis technology and $600,000. Harris Semiconductor invested a million dollars and two VC firms invested $2.7 million. Synopsys launched with seven GE employees: de Geus and six others. In 1987, after securing funding, they moved to Silicon Valley.

Listening to customers

Employee No. 8 was Deirdre Hanford, who started as an applications engineer and is now senior vice president of market development. "Aart could have spent the next year developing this product behind closed doors," she says. "Instead, we went to the customer to get feedback. He had a sense of the customer right from the beginning."


Although he was CEO, he knew he wasn't ready to run the company. "He was smart to bring in a leader for the CEO role," Hanford says. "He has a good knowledge of where he is strong and where he has to develop."


De Geus hired Harvey Jones Jr., who was founder and CEO of Daisy Systems Corp., an early EDA company. Jones led Synopsys until the early 1990s, when in January 1994 it went through a transition that resulted in de Geus becoming CEO.






"We work well together. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. If we do, then I don't have any value to Aart."
—Chi-Foon Chan, president and COO, Synopsys


 


Walske says Jones wanted to leave and de Geus wasn't ready to be CEO. "Aart was a technology and product guy. He had not shown much affinity toward selling." De Geus became COO and president, then proceeded to learn the business. "One of his strengths is his ability to look critically at himself and stick with the job," says Walske. "His self awareness is a real asset."


Bryant agrees: "I've only met a few people in my life who take coaching and really analyze it. Once Aart has the learning, he acts on it."


Observers have a hard time finding faults. Smith says his consensus style takes time and could be counterproductive in certain situations but "it hasn't hurt him yet."


At any rate, de Geus has become more decisive, says Bryant. "Pulling the trigger is not a problem anymore. He has restructured the company, restructured the board and made the acquisition of Avant!."


It was a tough year for Synopsys, but not as tough as it was for most. The company expects revenues to fall just short of a billion dollars for 2002. For the first three fiscal quarters, it reported a net loss of $102.2 million on sales of $597.3 million. "Our sales are not linked to volume, but to how many designs are started," says de Geus. "The R&D expenses are extremely stable in our industry."


"In an economic downturn, the strong companies get stronger," he adds. That would also explain the Avant! acquisition and Synopsys' recent acquisition of inSilicon Corp., San Jose, a provider of IP cores.


The best of times lie ahead for EDA, which becomes more important as chip designs get more complicated. The EDA software market is expected to top $5 billion by 2006, according to Dataquest (see chart above).


In Switzerland, de Geus was the de facto leader of his band. "We were the No. 1 blues band in Switzerland, but there were only two blues bands," he notes. EDA is now a battle of two bands, and de Geus is leading, as well as learning, at Synopsys.

The Aart of de Geus

Bill Roberts - December 01, 2002

Lead guitar players are notorious ego-maniacs but not Aart de Geus, lead guitarist of Silicon Valley's Full Disclosure Blues Band. "Whenever I play with Aart, he's part of the whole," says bass player Gary Smith. "Once we get the rhythms down, the breaks down, Aart says, 'Okay guys, now let's play together.' He has us practice in a circle so we can watch each other."

Like the other five band members, de Geus has a day job. He's co-founder, chairman and CEO of Synopsys Inc., Mountain View, CA, an electronic design automation (EDA) software developer that changed the EDA landscape this year with its acquisition of Avant! Corp., Fremont, CA. For this and many other reasons, ELECTRONIC BUSINESS selects de Geus as its CEO of the Year for 2002.
De Geus (pronounced de-GEE-us) is a top-flight technologist who has become an astute businessman with a consensus management style. He's a champion for learning—for himself, his employees and Silicon Valley youth. With his passion for technology and widely applauded integrity, de Geus has become a senior statesman in the under-appreciated EDA industry.
Analysts praise the Avant! deal, which makes Synopsys the second billion-dollar EDA company, pitting it against No. 1, Cadence Design Systems Inc., San Jose. "I expect Synopsys to be No. 1 in a couple of years," says Smith, whose day job is EDA analyst for the Dataquest division of Gartner Inc., Stamford, CT. "A $5-billion company is not out of the realm of possible."

The merger, however, is fraught with potential peril. De Geus must orchestrate the integration of two vastly different cultures. Synopsys is ethical and consensus oriented. Avant! was autocratic and tainted by criminal and civil charges that it stole intellectual property (IP) from Cadence. Observers say de Geus is up to the challenge of this merger and to leading Synopsys to multi-billion-dollar revenues.

Drop it off a cliff

De Geus learned his first guitar licks at 14, inspired by the Chicago-style blues of T Bone Walker. He was born in Holland and reared in Switzerland, where he played in the Black Cat Bone Blues Band for 10 years. Now 48, he has little time for music. He plays at home in Los Altos Hills, once a year with Full Disclosure and an occasional jam. The band, however, is an important metaphor.


"In a band, the key skill is listening," de Geus says. "Most people think skill on the instrument is key. That's important, but listening to others and how you play together is more important. A good band also learns to deal with individual egos. Much of the management style at Synopsys is like that band model."

Grant Pierce, a Full Disclosure member and CEO at Sonics Inc., Mountain View, agrees: "Aart listens, which is extremely valuable in music and management. He understands how to give space and take space in the process of collaboration and looks for complements to his own skills."





"In a band, THE KEY SKILL IS LISTENING. A good band also learns to deal with individual egos. Much of the management syle at Synopsys is like that band model."
—Aart de Geus, chairman and CEO, Synopsys Inc.


Smith tells a story that makes the same point. The band's signature "Stormy Monday" features a raucous de Geus solo. At practice before a gig earlier this year, de Geus suggested a dramatic effect at the expense of his solo. "He said, 'Why don't we take it from this break and drop it off a cliff.'" Translation: Cut the volume from loud to soft.


"When you're rocking hard, it's hard to go off the cliff at the same time," says Smith. At the gig, the musicians followed de Geus's lead and did fine. "The rhythm was very low and you could hardly hear the guitar solo. I got the chills. I think Aart did, too."

Stormy Monday

On Monday, Dec. 3, 2001, northern California was reeling from a storm that caused floods and power outages. On this stormy Monday, Synopsys dropped the news that it would acquire Avant! for stock worth about $775 million. A pessimist might have seen a bad omen in the timing.

Six months earlier, Avant! founder Gerry Hsu and six other executives pleaded no contest to charges of stealing Cadence IP and using it in their early place-and-route products. Some of the executives went to jail. In mid-November, Cadence agreed to accept $265 million to settle the civil suit (see our Web-exclusive story Avant!/Cadence battle is finally over).

Synosys and Avant! couldn't be more different. Synopsys manages by consensus; Avant! by fiat. The 2,500 Synopsys employees are encouraged to take risks. The 1,500 Avant! employees were ordered to do as they were told. Synopsys has a reputation for integrity. Avant! had a reputation for, uh, being criminal. It isn't far-fetched to compare the integration of the two to the merging of the two Germanys.

"Most engineers are going to be way more comfortable at Synopsys than at Avant!," says Joe Costello, CEO at think3 Inc., Santa Clara, CA, and the former Cadence CEO who sued Avant!. "But culture permeates a company so deeply in so many ways. It is history, practices, customer relationships, etc. It is amazing how hard culture is to eradicate."

"We wrestled with the acquisition of Avant! for three or four years. Aart was always against it because of the integrity issue," says Steven Walske, a Synopsys board member since 1991. "We decided not to pursue it. It was not just the ethics, but it was more expensive then." Synopsys opted to build its own back-end tools, but found it difficult.

Jewel and dirt ball

After the criminal case, the executives were gone and the tainted company cost less. "We started another round of discussions," says Walske. "The board's major consideration was to make sure we had a plan to mitigate the negatives."


CFO Brad Henske suggested insurance to cover the civil suit. "Avant! was a big jewel with a dirt ball on it," he says. He negotiated a policy, with a $300-million-plus premium, signed on Dec. 3, 2001. The insurer is paying the $265 million to Cadence.

Avant! gives Synopsys a complete IC design solution. It's widely used back-end place-and-route, analysis and extraction tools complement Synopsys' leading front-end synthesis tools. "We can go to the customer with a bigger value proposition," de Geus says (see ELECTRONIC BUSINESS, "Design Duopoly," June 2002).




Together their 2001 sales were $1.08 billion, putting Synopsys in a position to challenge Cadence, whose 2001 sales were $1.4 billion (see pie chart above). "Synopsys [with] Avant! is extraordinarily powerful," says Bill Frerichs, an equity analyst for D.A. Davidson & Co., Portland, OR. "I don't expect either [Synopsys or Cadence] to maintain an unbeatable lead over the other over the long term. It's going to be extremely competitive."


And a bigger Synopsys now qualifies for more stock portfolios, Frerichs says. EDA stocks haven't had the wild price fluctuations of other technology stocks. This was to their detriment during the bubble, but serves them well now. Still, Frerichs says, the market doesn't fully appreciate Synopsys: "I'm not sure Wall Street has awakened to what a powerful offering this is."

Two in the box

"Avant! was a bold move," says de Geus. "Especially during this downturn and with their legal stuff." He says integrating the two cultures will take a couple of years and depends on good management. De Geus and his executives revamped their two-day management course that he helps teach. "Every time I teach it, I'm sharpening the ability to voice what we mean by culture and the expectations of management."


De Geus and his executives learned from mistakes with earlier acquisitions, especially the importance of integrating two sales forces. The Avant! deal closed on June 6, 2002. Within a week, they had consolidated the two sales teams. Three weeks later the sales staff met to go over product roadmaps and strategies.

"In a detailed review at the last board meeting, I was amazed at how far they had come," says Andy Bryant, a Synopsys director since 1999 and CFO at Intel Corp., Santa Clara. He credits de Geus for the strategy and President and COO Chi-Foon Chan for the details. "Chi-Foon has done a wonderful job of laying the foundation of trust and cooperation that should allow them to deal with any issues later."




"Aart listens, which is extremely valuable in music and management. HE UNDERSTANDS HOW TO GIVE SPACE AND TAKE SPACE in the process of collaboration and looks for complements to his own skills."
—Grant Pierce, a Full Disclosure member and CEO, Sonics Inc.


Chan, a 12-year Synopsys veteran who once worked for Intel, has been COO for four years. He and de Geus both appear in the same box at the top of the org chart—"two in the box," they call it. Together, they manage 12 direct reports; Chan reports to de Geus. It works. They think of each other as professional soul mates. "We work well together," says Chan. "That doesn't mean we agree on everything. If we do, then I don't have any value to Aart."


"It is a relationship where ideas get developed and mature by a rapid back and forth between us," says de Geus. "Most people don't appreciate how valuable this is."

Screw-ups

De Geus gave a generous three hours over three interviews for this article. Slender with a crop of curly blond hair, he's boyish, enthusiastic and introspective. Earlier in life, he read Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, and did self-analysis with Jungian analysts, which influences him to this day. De Geus scrutinizes de Geus as thoroughly as he does business problems. "As a CEO, it is good to have a certain degree of self doubt. Most of the tough stuff one learns by really screwing up," he says.


He gives employees a wide berth to take risks. "You give a lot if you believe that every person has 100% potential for what they do. Synopsys accepted me as a CEO who had to learn a bunch of things. If you generalize that, then you have a company committed to learning."


His commitment to learning extends beyond Synopsys. In 1999, he founded the Synopsys Silicon Valley Science and Technology Outreach Foundation, Mountain View, to promote project-based science learning in Santa Clara County. Synopsys donates about $800,000 a year for grants to teachers and public schools and for the regional science fair.





As board vice chairman for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, San Jose, de Geus also urges CEOs to participate in a program that gives school teachers paid summer fellowships at electronics companies. Thanks to his efforts, during the worst downturn in decades it placed a record 130 teachers this year, says Carl Guardino, CEO of the group.


De Geus's own learning experiences were diverse. In Switzerland, he became multilingual. He speaks five languages, including impeccable English with a slight accent. Home life with his chemist father was intellectually rigorous. As a child, he wired lamps and electrical switches, but Lego was a stronger lure. "It is a fundamental set of building blocks. I often use the analogy that the modern system on a chip can be brought back to Lego." He still plays with Lego blocks with his two daughters.

Lessons from the farm

He spent boyhood summers on a farm in the Netherlands. "There's a great dependency among the players. Everyone has a role. Even the youngest kids get the eggs. There's no question about whether you would contribute. So often the management problems at Synopsys are not all that different from managing a crew in the field or being a member of a crew."


After high school, he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnical Institute where he earned an electrical engineering degree. In 1979, he went to graduate school at Southern Methodist University outside Dallas. "I just wanted to get out of Switzerland. Graduate school was an elegant way to do that."

In 1981, he went to work for General Electric Corp. in Research Triangle Park, NC, developing CAD tools by day and completing his dissertation by night. He hired university students to work with him at GE and soon became a manager. He also met his future wife, Esther, a Swiss student at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.

In 1985, during a deep industry downturn, GE exited the chip business. "I started to interview for jobs, but saw that my team was as good as some I interviewed with." During his search, he met VC investors who encouraged him to do a spinout. "The synthesis technology we had developed was exciting. But I would not do anything without talking to GE. They had treated us well, and it was their IP. We would make a proposal."


In exchange for equity, GE put up the synthesis technology and $600,000. Harris Semiconductor invested a million dollars and two VC firms invested $2.7 million. Synopsys launched with seven GE employees: de Geus and six others. In 1987, after securing funding, they moved to Silicon Valley.

Listening to customers

Employee No. 8 was Deirdre Hanford, who started as an applications engineer and is now senior vice president of market development. "Aart could have spent the next year developing this product behind closed doors," she says. "Instead, we went to the customer to get feedback. He had a sense of the customer right from the beginning."


Although he was CEO, he knew he wasn't ready to run the company. "He was smart to bring in a leader for the CEO role," Hanford says. "He has a good knowledge of where he is strong and where he has to develop."


De Geus hired Harvey Jones Jr., who was founder and CEO of Daisy Systems Corp., an early EDA company. Jones led Synopsys until the early 1990s, when in January 1994 it went through a transition that resulted in de Geus becoming CEO.






"We work well together. THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE AGREE ON EVERYTHING. If we do, then I don't have any value to Aart."
—Chi-Foon Chan, president and COO, Synopsys


 


Walske says Jones wanted to leave and de Geus wasn't ready to be CEO. "Aart was a technology and product guy. He had not shown much affinity toward selling." De Geus became COO and president, then proceeded to learn the business. "One of his strengths is his ability to look critically at himself and stick with the job," says Walske. "His self awareness is a real asset."


Bryant agrees: "I've only met a few people in my life who take coaching and really analyze it. Once Aart has the learning, he acts on it."


Observers have a hard time finding faults. Smith says his consensus style takes time and could be counterproductive in certain situations but "it hasn't hurt him yet."


At any rate, de Geus has become more decisive, says Bryant. "Pulling the trigger is not a problem anymore. He has restructured the company, restructured the board and made the acquisition of Avant!."


It was a tough year for Synopsys, but not as tough as it was for most. The company expects revenues to fall just short of a billion dollars for 2002. For the first three fiscal quarters, it reported a net loss of $102.2 million on sales of $597.3 million. "Our sales are not linked to volume, but to how many designs are started," says de Geus. "The R&D expenses are extremely stable in our industry."


"In an economic downturn, the strong companies get stronger," he adds. That would also explain the Avant! acquisition and Synopsys' recent acquisition of inSilicon Corp., San Jose, a provider of IP cores.


The best of times lie ahead for EDA, which becomes more important as chip designs get more complicated. The EDA software market is expected to top $5 billion by 2006, according to Dataquest (see chart above).


In Switzerland, de Geus was the de facto leader of his band. "We were the No. 1 blues band in Switzerland, but there were only two blues bands," he notes. EDA is now a battle of two bands, and de Geus is leading, as well as learning, at Synopsys.

Aart de Geus' Moment







Around 1986, my team in North Carolina became part of Calma, which GE had acquired as part of a grand scheme of building a position in high tech. Unfortunately Calma was in decline and we self-tasked ourselves with trying to deliver a cool EDA product that could help bring “zing” to the company. 
In my team, we had developed a program called SOCRATES, which stood for “Synthesis and Optimization of Combinatorics using a Rule-based And Technology-independent Expert System.” Known today as “Design Compiler,” this synthesis tool was getting some great results and since we were presenting a technical paper on it at DAC in Las Vegas anyway, on the spur of the moment we decided to take SOCRATES to DAC and get some feedback from potential commercial users.

This is where the approach became a bit more ad-hoc: Using green felt, plastic lettering from a local Walgreens, and some over-sized playing cards that Van Morgan from my team had found in a magic supply store, we put together a hand-glued poster that promised $50 to all who could beat SOCRATES in implementing a set of Boolean equations. Armed with a little computer, our dandy poster, and a lots of naïve enthusiasm, the Socrates team consisting of Dave Gregory, Bill Krieger, Tim Moore, Van Morgan, and I showed up uninvited and unannounced at the Calma booth to “save the day.” 

To say that they were less than enthusiastic about our showing up with an impromptu new “product demo” is an understatement. The idea of a $50 contest against some researchy program explained with a home-brewed poster inside their professionally pristine booth was not really how Calma rolled out new products...

In all honesty, if this happened at our company today, I would sincerely hope that our booth manager would blow his or her top too!  Fortunately, we were too young and starry-eyed to take the hint and after some back and forth, we were reluctantly tucked onto an interior wall in a little demo room, hoping we would stay well out of the way of general traffic.

However, while the responsible party for the Calma booth had a minor melt down, the interest of the customers was huge, thus further aggravating the situation! As we returned victorious to North Carolina, Calma management “promoted” us to become the support team for one of their old products for which, to add insult to injury, they mistakenly sent us object instead of source code. 

At DAC, we had gotten great feedback on Socrates, though. So much so that in December of that year, as GE decided to end their high tech adventure and started the path reduce and ultimately divest Calma, they supported us enthusiastically as we spun out into a small company that today still survives under the name of “Synopsys.”

Aart de Geus

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

For the chairman of the board of the Bertelsmann Foundation, see Aart Jan de Geus.
Aart J. de Geus (born 1954) is the Co-Founder, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys Inc. He is a fellow of IEEE and a Phil Kaufman Award winner. De Geus graduated with a master's degree in electrical engineering (1978) from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Swiss Federal Institute of technology), EPFL, Switzerland followed by a Ph.D. from Southern Methodist University, Texas, United States, in 1985.
Recognition and awards[edit]
Electronic Business magazine has chosen De Geus as one of "The 10 Most Influential Executives". He was honored for pioneering the commercial logic synthesis market by being named the third recipient ever to receive the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society Industrial Pioneer Award. In 2002, shortly after transacting the largest merger in electronic design automation (EDA) history, De Geus was named CEO of the Year by Electronic Business magazine; and in 2004, Entrepreneur of the Year in IT for Northern California by Ernst & Young. Aart is the recipient of the 2008 Phil Kaufman Award (considered as the Nobel prize in EDA) for distinguished contributions to EDA.
De Geus received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in 2004.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
