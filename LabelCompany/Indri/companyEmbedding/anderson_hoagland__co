Anderson Hoagland & Company




























The primary objective of Anderson Hoagland is to provide outstanding equity and fixed income management to our clients. We recognize, however, that clients may seek information or guidance not directly related to their investment portfolios.

This may include participating in meetings or telephone conferences where information about a client's investments is relevant to the work of another advisor (e.g., income tax preparation or trust and estate administration).

Anderson Hoagland & Company








































Each client portfolio at Anderson Hoagland is separately managed, constructed to meet individual investment objectives.  We work in partnership with our clients, devoting the time required to gain a meaningful understanding of each client’s circumstances, to develop realistic goals and to provide the ongoing communication that is the hallmark of a successful relationship.
We manage accounts on a discretionary basis under a written Investment Policy Statement prepared in conjunction with each client.  Our approach to asset allocation is careful and studied, and we strive to manage in the context of a client’s tax situation.
Our process begins with one or more pre-investment conferences during which we ascertain investment objectives, formulate asset allocation and develop a client’s investment policy statement.  During these conferences, we will also review existing holdings and identify securities for liquidation.  We work with our clients to assess the potential tax consequences of liquidating securities.  We seek to minimize taxes as we manage the transition from an existing portfolio to an AHCO portfolio.  Anderson Hoagland also has considerable experience working with clients who desire tax efficient diversification of a large position in a single stock. 
Following agreement on a client’s investment policy, our principals will work expeditiously toward portfolio implementation, so that cash balances are invested and a client’s portfolio reflects AHCO equity holdings.  We will fulfill fixed income allocations by locating  bonds that conform to a client’s investment policy and purchasing them as advantageously as possible. 
We prefer to meet with clients in person to conduct periodic progress reviews during which we discuss performance of portfolios relative to benchmarks and the need to modify any aspect of a client’s investment policy statement.  During these meetings, we typically discuss changes in portfolio composition, changes in a client’s situation, our expectations for the future and any actions taken to rebalance a client’s account to target allocations.
The additional tabs on this page provide detailed information regarding our approach to selecting equity and fixed income securities.
