History[edit]
The company was founded in 1961 by George G. Beasley. On February 11, 2000 the Group completed its IPO.
On October 2, 2014, CBS Radio announced that it would trade 14 radio stations located in Tampa, Florida, Charlotte, North Carolina and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to the Beasley Broadcast Group in exchange for 5 stations located in Miami and Philadelphia.[7] The swap was completed on December 1, 2014.[8]
On January 15, 2015, Beasley reorganized its radio stations, previously held by various subsidiaries, into Beasley Media Group; the Beasley Broadcast Group name was retained for the parent company.[3][4]
On July 19, 2016, Beasley announced that it would acquire Greater Media for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.[9] The deal gave Beasley additional stations in the Philadelphia and Boston markets and expanded the company into Detroit and three New Jersey markets.[10]
On February 2, 2017, Beasley announced that it would sell its six stations in the Greenville-New Bern-Jacksonville, North Carolina market to Curtis Media Group for $11 million to reduce the company's debt; one of the stations, WNCT-FM, was concurrently divested to Inner Banks Media to comply with FCC ownership limits.[11] The sale was completed on May 1, 2017.[12][13]
