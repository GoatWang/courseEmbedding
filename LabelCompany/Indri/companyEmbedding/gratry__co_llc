International & Global Equity Portfolio Management





Welcome to Gratry & Company

Founded in 1981, Gratry & Company, LLC is a SEC-registered* investment advisor which specializes in managing international and global equity portfolios for institutions and high net worth individuals. We work directly with private investors as well as intermediaries who hire us on behalf of their clients. Our firm is independent and 100% employee-owned.
We strive to deliver superior investment results while endeavoring to adhere to our long-standing investment discipline and the most basic of business principles – serving the client first.  We are grateful to our clients and loyal constituents, including consultants, financial advisors and their clients, without whom our success would not be possible.
What makes our firm unique is the combination of our business focus and our investment experience vigilantly delivered by an independent “boutique” investment firm.
*SEC registration does not imply any specific level of skill or training.

Philosophy


The Latin words visio, virtus, and vigilantia, translate roughly into vision, conviction, and vigilance. These words form the philosophical tenets of our company and how we approach the investment management process.
We are patient, long-term investors. We employ an active, fundamental investment process that is designed to produce superior, long-term, risk-adjusted returns. We believe in prudent diversification.
Our team is very focused. We employ a single investment methodology across all of our investment strategies.
