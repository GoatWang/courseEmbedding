Hooker
With a tradition of industry and community leadership since 1924 when our company was founded in Martinsville, Va., Hooker Furniture today is a complete home furnishings resource offering the world’s greatest selection of quality home entertainment, home office, accent, dining and bedroom furniture, as well as leather and custom seating.
Through our famous home office furniture, we equip you to work smarter and live better. With our home entertainment TV consoles and home theater wall units, we want to help you relax and reconnect with friends and family. Our stylish, unique line of accent furniture will inspire a renaissance in your home. Our dining furniture is designed to help you celebrate being together, and our bedroom furniture allows you to create your own intimate retreat.
During over 85 years of operation, we’ve sought to display integrity in our relationships with employees, customers, sales representatives, suppliers and the local communities in which we live and work. Product integrity also is paramount. For more on our finishes and construction, visit our quality story.
With a goal of enhancing quality of life for all the people we touch, Hooker Furniture strives to be financially, socially and environmentally responsible.

Financial Responsibility
One of the nation’s top publicly traded furniture companies, Hooker is listed on NASDAQ’s prestigious Global Select Market and has consistently been a furniture industry performance leader in profitability, sales and cash flow. For more, visit Investor Relations.
Environmental Responsibility
On behalf of future generations, Hooker Furniture is committed to environmental stewardship through sustainable business practices that help preserve the earth’s beauty and resources. For more on our ecological integrity, visit our environmental page.
Social Responsibility
Hooker is known as an active, contributing corporate citizen in the Virginia and North Carolina communities in which we work and live. Our company is a leading contributor to charitable organizations such as the United Way, education and the arts, and our employees provide service to these organizations through volunteerism and board memberships. The Hooker Educational Foundation has awarded more than one million dollars in scholarships to over 300 children of company employees since its inception in the 1990’s.
Company History
In 1925, four-year-old Clyde Hooker Jr. pulled the cord on the steam whistle that signaled the first work day at Hooker Furniture. In his 40 years leading the company, Clyde’s dedication to the pursuit of making stylish, beautiful, well-made furniture propelled the company to become one of the nation’s premier importers and manufacturers of furniture.
In 2000, Clyde passed the torch of leadership to Paul B. Toms Jr, grandson of the company’s founder, making Hooker a third-generation company and one of the few furniture firms still led by a member of the founding family.
Hooker Furniture’s upholstery division includes upscale leather seating producer Bradington-Young based in Hickory, N.C., and Sam Moore Furniture a Bedford, Va.-based specialist in quality occasional chairs, settees and sectionals with an emphasis on fabric-to-frame customization. We offer a complete bedroom line for children, teens and young adults through our Opus Designs division.
Corporate Operations
Headquartered in Martinsville, Va. where we maintain a corporate office and several distribution facilities, Hooker Furniture employs around 800 people at our Virginia and North Carolina locations. Hooker imports an extensive line of furnishings from factories throughout the Pacific Rim, Mexico and Central America. The design and engineering of these imported furnishings is all carefully overseen by Hooker in compliance with our high quality standards.
