In this video you see the MicroSphere ( adapted for the wind tunnel ) running in the open environment at VERY low wind speeds for the wind tunnel. Actually it is at idle. ( around 6ms ) In this wind speed we out preformed what previous data had showed us and had very high voltage. After this we closed up with wind tunnel and performed a full test run which you can see in the time lapse. All in all it was a successful day of testing.Wind Tunnel Day发布者：American Wind Inc2,161 次播放2,161 次播放American Wind Inc · 2016年11月21日 · http://www.gotinybefree.com/tiny-micro-wind-turbine-techno…/ A Great Article written about the MicroCube! when you get done reading the article go visit our website at www.americanwindinc.comNew Tiny Micro Wind Turbine Technology for Off-grid Living, 24-7 Power Generation, Backup Battery ChargingAre you running off Micro Wind Turbine Power yet?  If not, why not?gotinybefree.comAmerican Wind Inc 上传了 3 张新照片到相册：MicroCube 。 · 2016年11月16日 · American Wind Inc · 2016年11月16日 · Whats the most effective way to use the MicroCube™ for large power? The Advanced WindWall is the answer. Our Advanced WindWall is a 100 turbine unit with a 100kW max power. Also it has a worm gear motor in the base that keeps it in the wind at all times. But the greatest advantage of the Advanced WindWall is creating large amounts of power in slight breezes. Because each MicroCube can produce 10v-12v at 5mph (2.2ms) wind speed, the Advanced WindWall can produce around 1000v-1200v at average wind speeds. None of our competitors can even come close to that.  Please Like and Share our posts and keep following us as we release more videos, data and more products. www.americanwindinc.comAmerican Wind Inc · 2016年11月15日 · The MicroCube runs in very low wind speeds, less than 5mph. While at this wind speeds we do not produce full power, we do get 10v-12v and the strategy is to link these small turbines together until you get the voltage you need. Our advanced wind wall is just a little over 9 sqft and has 100 MicroCubes linked together on a motorized base that keeps them in the wind the entire time, I'll let you do the math from there.
