               Company: Walnut Street Theatre Corporation
Job Details
               Company Size: Less than $1 mil - Employee Range: 25 to less than 100. Walnut Street Theatre is the oldest theatre in America. It stands alone as the only theatre operating continuously as a theatre since it opened in 1809. The significance of this fact cannot be overstated. The history of Walnut Street Theatre is, in large measure, the history of theatre in America. Every noteworthy American actor of the 19th century and many from the 20th century (not to mention famous actors from other countries) appeared on stage at Walnut Street Theatre just as it stands today. Some of the Walnut's shining stars include: Edwin Booth, Edwin Forrest, Helen Hayes, Houdini, George M. Cohan, Edward G. Robinson, George C. Scott, Jack Lemmon, Mike Nichols, Claudette Colbert, Jane Fonda, Julie Harris, Katharine Hepburn, Ethel Waters and Jessica Tandy. Philadelphians are justly proud of the many "firsts" associated with their City, but not many of them are aware of the firsts in the arts that occurred at Walnut Street Theatre. The Rivals was staged here in 1812. In attendance were President Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette. Over the years, the Walnut has been the home of many theatrical innovations. In 1837, it was the first theatre to install gas footlights, and in 1855, the Walnut became the first theatre to install air conditioning. The first copyright law protecting American plays has its roots at the Walnut. Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth, purchased the Walnut in 1865, two months after President Lincoln was assassinated. In 1923, Groucho Marx stopped his act on the Walnut stage to tell the audience that President Warren Harding had died. From 1941 to 1969, Walnut Street Theatre was owned by the Shubert Organization and was the site of numerous memorable pre-Broadway tryouts. These include A Streetcar Named Desire with Marlon Brando (1947), Mr. Roberts starring Henry Fonda (1948), Gigi with Audrey Hepburn (1951), The Diary of Anne Frank with Susan Strasburg (1955), A Raisin in the Sun starring Sidney Poitier (1959) and A Man For All Seasons starring Paul Scofield (1961). In 1964, the Walnut was designated a National Historic Landmark. Later, it was the site of the first presidential debate between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. In 1969, a non-profit corporation was formed to purchase and renovate the theatre. This led to the preservation of the 19th century facade just as it appeared on Walnut Street in 1828. Through the 1970's, Walnut Street Theatre became mainly a performing arts center that hosted programs produced by other organizations. By 1983, it was clear that this approach was not economically feasible. A new direction would have to be tried or Walnut Street Theatre, after 173 years, would have to close. Clearly, the Walnut had arrived at a crossroads. Never in its history had it been so threatened with extinction. A number of community leaders, led by Ed Rome, made a decision to search for a new Executive Director. After a nationwide search, Bernard Havard was interviewed and persuaded the Board to return the Walnut to a producing theatre. Havard was hired and a full season of plays was produced on the Mainstage during the 1983-84 season. With vision and inspirational leadership, Walnut Street Theatre was reconceived as a non-profit regional theatre dedicated to the preservation and development of the art of theatre. This distinction sets Walnut Street Theatre apart from most of its similarly-sized peers in the region which are commercial theatres formed to return a profit to their owners. They do not produce their own plays, but simply present productions that have originated elsewhere. As a non-profit theatre, the Walnut chooses and produces its own productions, handcrafted right here in Philadelphia. It does this not to make a profit, but to entertain, enlighten and educate the people of the Delaware Valley and to preserve this historic landmark's legacy. Since 1983, Walnut Street Theatre has produced over 145 plays, including 23 world premieres and 10 American premieres. The Walnut Street Theatre School was established in 1985 and has provided theatre instruction, self-improvement and a deepened appreciation of the art form through its Outreach Programs and classes to over 30,000 children and adults annually. The Studio 3 series was initiated in 1985 to provide more adventurous theatre experiences to theatregoers and to broaden the scope of theatre produced by the Walnut. In 1997, through a grant from the Independence Foundation, the theatre was renovated to become the Independence Studio on 3. Additionally, Walnut Street Theatre has supported the local arts community, acting as an incubator for other theatre companies in the early stages of their development. Indeed, the measure of success at Walnut Street Theatre can be taken not only by the full houses that enjoy programs on its Mainstage, but also by the attendance at other theatre and performing arts venues throughout our community. A study conducted by Ziff Marketing commissioned by the Pew Charitable Trust identifies Walnut Street Theatre as "an entry point for a large prospect market interested in attending the theatre in the Philadelphia area." Philadelphians and diverse audiences from across the Greater Philadelphia Region have rallied to the Walnut. Subscription audiences have grown from 0 in 1982 to over 50,000 today. Annual attendance exceeds 300,000, making Walnut Street Theatre a critical link between the City's commercial center and the historic district. During the summer of 2001, Walnut Street Theatre completed a number of projects to enhance artistry and preserve the historic building. One of these projects was the restoration of its 160-year-old Mainstage grid. In a theatre, a grid is a structure comprised of boards and beams that is suspended from the roof of the building over the stage. This grid then serves as the support structure from which key theatrical elements are hung, including stage curtains, pieces of scenery, lighting equipment and sound equipment. During the months of July and August, all of the old, worn wooden beams were replaced, steel reinforcement was added, and all of the mechanisms used to move scenery on and off stage was upgraded. This made the Walnut safer, allowed freedom to install more elaborate sets and preserved the integrity of the world's oldest continuously operating theatre. This project was supported jointly by a grant from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and the Helen Groome Beatty Trust. A second project was the upgrading of Mainstage lighting. This project optimized lighting safety and efficiency, and gave greater freedom to employ more creative lighting techniques. This project was made possible in part by a Cultural Economic Development Grant. These grants are funded by the Delaware River Port Authority, with administrative support provided by the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance (GPCA).

ABN Associates
P.O. Box 143
Lima, Pennsylvania 19037

March 9, 2004

Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549-0609

Re: Investment Company Governance; SEC File No. S7-03-04
Dear Mr. Katz:

This letter is submitted in response to a request for comment by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("you") on proposed regulatory changes.  These changes are intended to enhance the independence and effectiveness of investment company directors and to improve their ability to protect the interests of the registered investment companies ("funds") and fund shareholders they serve.  The proposed changes are published in Release No. IC-26323 (Jan. 15, 2004).  This letter is submitted on behalf of the undersigned and the other independent Trustees of Goldman Sachs Trust and Goldman Sachs Variable Insurance Trust, two open-end management investment companies consisting of 64 separate portfolios with assets of approximately $100 billion (the "Funds").  (See SEC Registration Nos. 811-5349 and 811-08361.)

You have proposed five principal regulatory changes to strengthen the independence of fund directors (as well as a sixth change relating to the retention of certain records).  Our comments on the proposed regulatory changes are as follows.

Board Composition.  We support the proposal to require that independent directors constitute a supermajority of a fund board which, in our view, could be either two-thirds or seventy-five percent of the board.  We also believe, if you adopt a supermajority requirement, that funds should be allowed at least eighteen months to comply with the requirement.

Independent Chairman of the Board.  We support the proposal to require that the chairman of a fund board be an independent director.  We have had an independent chairman of the board for more than ten years.  It has been our experience that the chairman can provide an important and meaningful role in the preparation of board agenda and in fostering the dialogue between fund management and the independent directors on fund-related matters.  With regards to your specific question whether an independent director is able to lead effectively the board through a discussion of a detailed and complex agenda, our response is "yes." Independent directors are fully capable in this regard.  Moreover, if a particular independent director/chairman is unable to lead board discussions effectively, it is likely that other independent directors will be able to serve capably as the chairman.  These views are also equally shared by management of our Funds.

On the other hand, with regards to your specific question whether the chairman of all board committees should also be required to be an independent director, our response is "no."  We believe that there are certain committees, such as dividend committees and valuation committees, where it is unnecessary to require that the chairman be independent.

Annual Self-Assessment.  We support the proposal to require fund directors to perform an evaluation, at least annually, of the effectiveness of the board and its committees.  We have been performing annual self-assessments for five years, and have found that the self-assessments have both strengthened our fund governance and have facilitated the dialogue among independent Board members, non-independent Board members and Fund management.  We believe, however, that all self-assessments must be held in strictest confidence to promote full and frank responses.  We are, therefore, uncertain whether we agree completely with your stated expectation that the minutes of the board of directors should reflect the substance of the matters discussed during the board's self-assessment, and we hope you will consider this point further.

With regards to your question whether you should restrict the number of fund boards on which a director serves, our response is "no."  We believe that the appropriate number of fund boards on which a director serves should be considered in a board's self-assessment, based on relevant circumstances and facts, and should not be determined by a Commission rule.  Moreover, we strongly support the practice of using pooled board structures as it leads to efficiencies in addressing issues common across a fund complex; our experience has borne this out.  

Separate Sessions.  We support the proposal that independent directors be required to meet at least quarterly in a separate session at which no interested persons of the fund are present (except fund counsel).  The independent members of the Funds' Board of Trustees, and certain Board committees (such as the Audit Committee), meet regularly in executive session without management or the interested Trustees present.  We believe these sessions have helped strengthen collaboration and teamwork among the non-interested Trustees and our ability to consider the matters presented to the Board and the Committees for review or action.  We also believe, however, that it is unnecessary to require by regulation that separate sessions be held more frequently than quarterly, so long as the independent Trustees have the discretion to do so.

Independent Director Staff.  We support the proposal that funds explicitly authorize the independent directors to hire employees and to retain advisers and experts necessary to carry out their duties.  The Funds' Board of Trustees and certain committees (such as the Audit Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee) already have this authority.  In addition, the Board of Trustees utilizes the services of the Funds' independent auditors and independent legal counsel and, in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, has selected a chief compliance officer for the Funds.  In these circumstances we do not believe that you should require independent directors to hire their own staff.

Other Matters.  In addition to our comments on your specific proposals, we note that in your release publishing these proposals you recognize that funds meet the investment needs and fulfill the expectations of their shareholders because of the efforts and skill of their investment advisers, and that investors do not generally invest in a fund because of the skill or reputation of its board of directors.  You also observed, however, that oversight by a fund's board of directors is critical because of the unique set of conflicts the investment adviser has with a fund.  As you proceed with the proposals discussed in this letter, as well as your other regulatory initiatives, we ask that you continue to recognize that your rules need to strike the proper balance between the responsibilities of management and the oversight responsibilities of fund directors.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment on your proposals.  We hope our thoughts are constructive.


Sincerely yours,

              /s/  Ashok N. Bakhru
