Announcement


View Product Photos




CHS Inc. announced today it has implemented a voluntary recall of 50-pound packages of its Kountry Buffet 14% Text and Provider 15% Pellet, both for Mature Cattle, Horses, Goats & Sheep due to excessive levels of copper.
No illnesses or deaths have been reported to date. Consumption of the affected product may cause potential health risks, including death, in sheep. Symptoms of copper toxicity in sheep include lethargy, anemic appearance, excessive teeth grinding, extreme thirst, pale membranes (jaundice) and bloody urine.
The recalled products were manufactured in September 2015 and October 2015 at CHS Inc.'s Harrisburg, Ore., feed mill and distributed to 42 customers in Oregon and Washington. Kountry Buffet 14% Text features a salmon-colored label attached to a brown bag. Provider 15% Pellet features a yellow label attached to a brown bag. Affected Lot numbers for either product can be found at the bottom of the label and are as follows:




Kountry Buffet 14% Text Lot #
Provider 15% Pellet Lot #




85092415-M702660
85101415-M732580


85100615-M720130
85101515-M734810


85101215-M728050
 


85101515-M734590
 


85102315-M748470
 




 
The potential presence of high copper levels was detected by routine sample tests of the product conducted by a third-party lab. After notifying the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in early November, the company began to proactively contact affected dealers and end consumers to inform each of the voluntary recall of all unconsumed product in the listed Lot numbers.
Consumers who purchased this product and have remaining quantities should immediately discontinue use and are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at (800) 398-0327 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. CDT. Information also is available at http://www.paybacknutrition.com.

History[edit]
CHS today is the result of many mergers of farmer-owned cooperatives. Significant events include the following.
In 1931 Farmers Union Central Exchange was founded in Saint Paul, Minnesota. That core cooperative company later became Cenex, a combination from the last two words in its former name.[4]
In 1998, Cenex merged with Harvest States Cooperatives to form Cenex Harvest States.[4]
In 2003, the cooperative changed its legal name to CHS Inc., with Cenex becoming the name of the energy brand.[4]
John Johnson was the President and CEO. Johnson began his career with former Harvest States in 1976 as a feed consultant in the GTA Feeds Division, later becoming regional sales manager, director of sales and marketing and general manager of GTA Feeds. He retired from CHS Inc on December 31, 2010.[5]
Carl Casale is the current President and CEO. Carl Casale became president and chief executive officer of CHS Inc., Jan. 1, 2011, after a 26-year career in agribusiness.
In November 2011, CHS acquired Israeli, TASE listed, soy protein company Solbar Industries for $133 Million.[6]
Harvest States Cooperatives was the largest recipient of federal farm subsidies in Minnesota between 1995 and 2012, having received over $48 million, mostly in the form of commodity subsidies.[7]
Products and services[edit]
