Akers Biosciences narrows loss, but revenue falls
LONDON--Medical testing product group Akers Biosciences Inc. (AKR.LN) Tuesday reported a narrower first-quarter loss, though it said margins and revenue fell.

					Full Description



Akers Biosciences, Inc., incorporated on March 9, 1989, develops, manufactures and supplies point-of-care screening and testing products designed to bring health-related information to the patient or clinician. The Company's product offerings and pipeline products focus on delivering diagnostic assistance in a range of healthcare fields/specialties, including cardiology/emergency medicine, metabolism/nutrition, diabetes, respiratory diseases and infectious diseases detection, as well as for on and off-the-job alcohol safety initiatives. The Company's primary focus is the development and sale of disposable diagnostic testing devices that can be performed in minutes, to facilitate time sensitive therapeutic decisions. The Company's main products are a disposable breathalyzer test that measures the blood alcohol content of the user, a rapid test detecting the antibody causing an allergic reaction to Heparin and a disposable breathalyzer test that measures Free Radical activity in the human body.MicroParticle Catalyzed Biosensor TechnologyThe Company's MicroParticle Catalyzed Biosensor (MPC Biosensor) breath condensate testing platform forms the basis of a number of marketed and pipeline products. The Company's disposable breath alcohol detectors are available in 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.05% and 0.08% blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and provide users with a test result in approximately two minutes. The Company's breath alcohol detection technology is paired with the quantitative precision of an electronic analyzer in the BreathScan PRO alcohol detection system. As with all BreathScan products, the test subject exhales into a specially calibrated, BreathScan PRO detector. The testing coordinator then inserts the used detector into the BreathScan PRO Digital Analyzer. After two minutes, the Analyzer's optics calculate the subject's BAC; the detectable range spans from 0.00% to 1.50% BAC.The Company's MPC Biosensor technology is being applied to the development of products that serve the nutraceutical and weight loss marketplaces. It has used its platform to design disposable breath tubes that measure ketone (acid) production associated with fat-burning (METRON and KetoChek) and oxidative stress levels that relate to cellular damage and the development of many preventable diseases (OxiChek). The Company is continuing its clinical development of the Breath Ketone Check disposable breath tube for the diagnosis of ketoacidosis in diabetics. Breath Ketone Check is being designed to provide real-time information that allows diabetics to determine if they have a more severe level of ketone (acid) build up in their body that can cause a life-threatening medical emergency called ketoacidosis.Particle ImmunoFiltration Assay TechnologyThe core products marketed under the Particle ImmunoFiltration Assay (PIFA) platform are the PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay, PIFA PLUSS PF4, and a range of rapid Infectious Disease screening tests. PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay and PIFA PLUSS PF4 determine if a patient, being treated with the blood thinner Heparin, may be developing a drug allergy. This clinical syndrome, referred to as Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT), reverses the Heparin's intended therapeutic effect and transforms it into a clotting agent.The PIFA line extension merges the PIFA testing platform with the Company's patented Rapid Blood Cell Separation Technology, marketed under the brand name seraSTAT. The combination of these two technologies condenses the sample preparation and analysis procedures as the micro-volume of a seraSTAT-prepared patient specimen is delivered directly into the PIFA cassette for immediate testing.The Company applies the PIFA PLUSS methodology to its infectious disease testing products to further consolidate the test result turn-around time and eliminate the need for any specialized sample preparation personnel or equipment. The Company's reagent work is focused on infectious diseases, markers of cardiovascular disease and blood typing tests, including Chlamydia, Malaria, Dengue Fever, Troponin I and ABOD Battlefield Blood Transfusion Card.Synthetic Macrocycle Complex TechnologySynthetic Macrocycle Complex (SMC) Technology is a colorimetric testing methodology that pairs a reagent (a substance or mixture for use in chemical analysis or other reactions) with a hand-held, photometric reader that determines the quantitative level of a therapeutic drug in a patient's blood sample. The technology also permits the use of whole blood samples collected from a simple finger stick, making products that use this technology flexible within the healthcare delivery system.Rapid Enzymatic Assay TechnologyRapid Enzymatic Assay (REA) technology enables the rapid detection of metabolites in blood and urine in assay formats that are easy-to-use and deliver quantitative or semi-quantitative results. Products that employ REA technology are primarily intended for pharmaceutical, nutritional and over-the-counter (OTC) markets.minDNA TechnologyminDNA technology facilitates the analysis of deoxyribo nucleic acid (DNA) by a hand-held photometric reader. A mixture consisting of a patient's whole blood specimen and a disposable reagent is exposed to the minDNAnalyzer, a digital hand-held reflectance photometer. These assays can be utilized at the point of care setting by non-clinical laboratory personnel using finger stick blood samples, or in the laboratory using Ethylene-Diamine-Tetra-Acetic acid (EDTA) whole blood specimens obtained through venous blood draws. This technology can be applied to the development of rapid white blood cell count and absolute neutrophil count assays that can monitor side effects of certain psychiatric and oncology drugs.The Company competes with Abbott, ACON Laboratories, Inc., Alere, Diagnostica Stago, SA., Immucor, Inc., OraSure Technologies, Inc. and Quidel Corporation.
