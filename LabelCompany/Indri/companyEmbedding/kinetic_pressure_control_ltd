Latest Customer Reviews




As usual, it is working wonderfully. The customer was dumbfounded on how quick the unit snaps to setpoint and holds.–A Gas Mixing Customer


I’ve had to work with Alicat staff several times, and I cannot believe how much effort your guys put into helping us out. Out of every vendor and company we’ve ever worked into in the prototyping industry, Alicat has always been a positive experience. I don’t know how your staff stays so positive knowing that they live in Arizona.–A Prototyping Customer


No complaints here, you guys did everything you said you would – when you said you would. And the unit is the star of the lab.–An Industrial Manufacturing Customer


I have been using Alicat Flow Meters, Pressure Meters and Pressure Controllers since 2006, so far I am happy with the product and the service from you guys, I feel that I am buying more than the instrument itself, I feel more like I am buying a working solution, even though this might sound cliché, is how I see Alicat, good job!!–An Appliance Manufacturing Customer


Thanks for such a quick response on this. I have to say you have exceeded my timing expectation; I have yet to receive a single call back from your competitors. We will keep you in mind for future flow projects.–An Automotive Manufacturing Customer


Just wanted to let you know I am a big fan of Alicat’s pressure and flow controllers and flow meters as well. They have solved many testing problems for me over the years. Great products you are marketing!–A Plastics Manufacturing Customer


I’ve been really happy with the flowmeter so far. I’ve used it a few times in the field to calibrate and verify flows on TEOMs and BAMs. So far, it responds quickly and has given us accurate flows. It’s particularly handy at a monitoring site I run on a rooftop, because I can read the screen from ground level. That means I can look at different flow rates without having to keep climbing up and down the ladder.–An Ambient Air Monitoring Customer


I wanted to tell you that I have had a wonderful experience with your company. Your customer service team is great, I got answers back quickly, and overall I am very satisfied. Whatever you are doing, keep doing it! You get an A++ for me!–An Electronics Manufacturing Customer


We like your fast turn on orders.–A Biotechnology Customer


Alicat mass air flow meters have proven to be accurate, so accurate that we use them to calibrate other instruments.
Another advantage over others we have used is how steady the read out is; what a difference this makes when one is trying to record values!–A Spray Painting Customer


Please thank Jesse for his help getting the custom order in place and processed for timely delivery. I can honestly say that we are very pleased with the MFCs, flow meters, and pressure controllers from Alicat that we already have on site; we have a few from other Mfrs but definitely prefer the ease of use, options available and excellent performance in the units from Alicat.
–A Bioreactor Customer


I choose Alicat because of your excellent delivery time and low cost. You also have a good reputation among users.–An HVAC Customer


I was lucky enough to get my hands on (quite literally) a Whisper in Atlanta, Ga during the NAAMC conference this year. As I was looking it over and talking with the nice folks at the booth I had a vision of myself doing a flow verification on my API calibrator in minutes and not hours. I took a flyer and presented it to my boss again and again and again. We just bought a higher flow unit so I can calibrate all the MFC’s in our calibrators and our orifices for particulate work. I’m excited!
–An Air Particulate Monitoring Customer

Flow Reading Questions


The meter's flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow.
The differential pressure sensor may be damaged. Avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of 75 psid (15 psid for “Whisper” Series instruments). A common cause of this problem is instantaneous application of high-pressure gas as from a snap acting solenoid valve upstream of the meter. Damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty.

The controller's flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow.
Differential pressure sensor may be damaged. Avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of 75 psid (15 psid for “Whisper” Series instruments). While in most cases the valve will help to protect the sensor against large pressure drops, a sudden change in pressures can subject the sensor to high pressure drops if the valve does not have enough time to adjust.  Damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty.

The meter's flow reading is fixed at zero regardless of actual flow rate.
Alicat mass flow meters are equipped with a tare function via grounding a specified pin.  Please check electrical connections to ensure this pin is not grounded.  Pin out diagrams are available in the back of the manual for your reference.

The meter reads negative flow when there is a confirmed no flow condition.
This is an indication of an improper tare. If the meter is tared while there is flow, that flow is accepted as zero flow. When an actual zero flow condition exists, the meter will read a negative flow. Simply re-tare at the confirmed zero flow condition. Also note that while the meter is intended for positive flow, it will read negative flow with reasonable accuracy (it is not calibrated for bidirectional flow) and no damage will result.

The flow flutters or is jumpy.
The meters are very fast and will pick up any actual flow fluctuations such as from a diaphragm pump, etc. Also, inspect the inside of the upstream connection for debris such a Teflon tape shreds. Mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average (GRA) for both pressure and flow rate measurements that can aid in allowing fluctuating flow to be read. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications.

The meter does not agree with another meter I have in line.
Volumetric meters will often not agree with one another when put in series because they are affected by pressure drops. Volumetric flow meters should not be compared to mass flow meters. Mass flow meters can be compared against one another provided there are no leaks between the two meters and they are set to the same standard temperature and pressure. Both meters must also be calibrated (or set) for the gas being measured. M Series mass flow meters are normally set to Standard Temperature and Pressure conditions of 25° C and 14.695 PSIA. The standard temperature and pressure can be changed via the front panel and serial communications. It can also be ordered with specialty standard temperature and pressure.

My volumetric meter reading is strange, inconsistent, or incorrect.
Make sure you use a volumetric flow meter only under low pressure (close to atmospheric) and with little to no back pressure for accurate readings. Mass meters should be used for higher pressure applications.

The device jumps to zero at low flow.
Mass flow and pressure devices feature a programmable deadband or zero band. The factory setting is usually 0.5% of full scale. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications.


Gas Compatibility Concerns


My device has a specific gas listed in the part number. Can I use it with other gases?
Absolutely! The gas that appears in the part number is what your unit has been pre-selected to when you received it from the factory. You will still have access to Gas Select™ 5.0 which has 98 or more preloaded gas calibrations to choose from as well as our COMPOSER™ firmware which allows you to create up to 20 custom gas compositions.

I accidentally selected the wrong gas. What can I do?
Both the mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate depend on the viscosity of the gas. If a different gas is selected than what is flowing through the device, the flow rates will be off by approximately the ratio of the viscosities. Simply take your reading and multiply by the ratio of the selected gas’s viscosity to the desired gas’s viscosity.
A detailed description with examples can be found at www.alicat.com/faq/accidentally-wrong-gas-selected-can.


Communications Help


The display does not come on or is weak.
Check power and ground connections.

The output signal is lower than the reading at the display.
This can occur if the output signal is measured some distance from the meter as voltage drops in the wires increase with distance. Using heavier gauge wires, especially in the ground wire, can reduce this effect.

The device is responding slower than expected.
Mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average (GRA) for both pressure and flow rate measurements that may lead to a slower perceived response time. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications. Controllers also have programmable valve tuning available via the front panel and serial communications which can further improve the response time.

My device is locked and 'LCK' is showing on the screen
Alicat devices come with a locking option for applications in which the buttons may accidentally be pressed changing crucial device settings. Devices with newer firmware revisions can be unlocked by pressing and holding the outer four buttons on the front panel. All devices can be unlocked via serial communications. Please follow the steps below.


Download Serial Terminal from www.alicat.com/support/software-drivers.
Make sure all drivers associated with the cables are installed. Please look for any discs that came with the cables.
Open the “Control Panel” and then open “Device Manager”.
Under “Ports”, find the COM number the Alicat is connected to and write this down for later.
Open Serial Terminal
Serial Terminal will ask for the COM port and baud rate.  Enter the COM port you found in part 2 and a baud rate of 19200.
Type A$$U and press enter.
Your device should now be unlocked!


Occasionally the device unit ID may be different than A.  If A$$U does not unlock, try B$$U or C$$U, etc all the way to Z$$U.  To change the unit ID back to A, you can type *@=A and press enter to give all connected devices a unit ID of A.

The RS-232 Serial Communications is not responding.
Check that your unit is powered and connected properly. Be sure that the port on the computer to which the unit is connected is active. Confirm that the port settings are correct per the RS-232 instructions in this manual. When connecting multiple devices to a single COM port, please ensure that all devices have a unique unit ID.

The BB9 multi-drop box isn't showing up under COM ports in my device manager.

If the BB9 multi-drop box is showing up under “other” in your device manager instead of “Ports (COM & LPT)”, the most likely cause is missing drivers. While these should install automatically when plugging into your computer, occasionally security settings can prohibit them from installing. Please try installing the drivers directly from www.alicat.com/drivers.
If using a USB port with Windows 7 and an error pops up saying “One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it”, the USB port itself is having issues. Microsoft has released a solution on one of their forums at www.answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/one-of-the-usb-devices-attached-to-your-computer/b8a2fc66-5e58-48a3-9d3b-1db2858c3a9e.
If using the 9 pin serial connection on your computer and nothing shows up in device manager, it’s possible the COM port on the computer has died. BB9 multi-drop boxes come with cables to connect to 9 pin serial ports or USB ports. Please try connecting to the computer using a different port and checking the device manager again.


FlowVisionSC or FlowVisionMX is displaying an error beginning with &quotMethod not found: 'System.String...'&quot
FlowVisionSC and FlowVisionMX require the most recent Microsoft .NET framework.  Please find the most recent available .NET framework at www.microsoft.com/net/download/framework.

Positive innovation for the oil industry.



Unlocking new value through innovation.











Delivering positive innovation to the offshore drilling industry with new ways of thinking. We are committed to increasing safety and reducing the environmental impact of offshore drilling.
We are a startup oilfield engineering and service business. Our company is founded on innovation and we look forward to bringing to market many new and innovative products. We are focused on subsea technology and in particular on technologies that make offshore drilling safer and protect the environment.
The first product we are developing is the patent pending Kinetic Blowout Stopper (K-BOS). This technology is fundamentally different to current BOPs as it is powered by a propellant charge verses current hydraulic technology. The K-BOS performance is far superior as compared with hydraulic offerings. This technology can easily shear tool-joints, drill collars and very large diameter heavy casing. Not only does the K-BOS offer far superior shearing ability it is also being designed to be capable of shutting in a flowing well; this is only something a fast acting propellant based device could achieve.

Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control - Wikipedia

Energy profile diagram for kinetic versus thermodynamic product reaction.


Thermodynamic reaction control or kinetic reaction control in a chemical reaction can decide the composition in a reaction product mixture when competing pathways lead to different products and the reaction conditions influence the selectivity or stereoselectivity. The distinction is relevant when product A forms faster than product B because the activation energy for product A is lower than that for product B, yet product B is more stable. In such a case A is the kinetic product and is favoured under kinetic control and B is the thermodynamic product and is favoured under thermodynamic control.[1][2][3]
The conditions of the reaction, such as temperature, pressure, or solvent, affect which reaction pathway may be favored: either the kinetically controlled or the thermodynamically controlled one. Note this is only true if the activation energy of the two pathways differ, with one pathway having a lower Ea (energy of activation) than the other.
Prevalence of thermodynamic or kinetic control determines the final composition of the product when these competing reaction pathways lead to different products. The reaction conditions as mentioned above influence the selectivity of the reaction - i.e., which pathway is taken.

Scope[edit]
In Diels-Alder reactions[edit]
The Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene with furan can produce two isomeric products. At room temperature, kinetic reaction control prevails and the less stable endo isomer 2 is the main reaction product. At 81 °C and after long reaction times, the chemical equilibrium can assert itself and the thermodynamically more stable exo isomer 1 is formed[citation needed]. The exo product is more stable by virtue of a lower degree of steric congestion, while the endo product is favoured by orbital overlap in the transition state.



In enolate chemistry[edit]
In the protonation of an enolate ion, the kinetic product is the enol and the thermodynamic product is a ketone or aldehyde. Carbonyl compounds and their enols interchange rapidly by proton transfers catalyzed by acids or bases, even in trace amounts, in this case mediated by the enolate or the proton source.
In the deprotonation of an unsymmetrical ketone, the kinetic product is the enolate resulting from removal of the most accessible α-H while the thermodynamic product has the more highly substituted enolate moiety.[4][5][6][7] Use of low temperatures and sterically demanding bases increases the kinetic selectivity. Here, the difference in pKb between the base and the enolate is so large that the reaction is essentially irreversible, so the equilibration leading to the thermodynamic product is likely a proton exchange occurring during the addition between the kinetic enolate and as-yet-unreacted ketone. An inverse addition (adding ketone to the base) with rapid mixing would minimize this. The position of the equilibrium will depend on the countercation and solvent.




If a much weaker base is used, the deprotonation will be incomplete, and there will be an equilibrium between reactants and products. Thermodynamic control is obtained, however the reaction remains incomplete unless the product enolate is trapped, as in the example below. Since H transfers are very fast, the trapping reaction being slower, the ratio of trapped products largely mirrors the deprotonation equilibrium.




In electrophilic additions[edit]
The electrophilic addition reaction of hydrogen bromide to 1,3-butadiene above room temperature leads predominantly to the thermodynamically more stable 1,4 adduct, 1-bromo-2-butene, but decreasing the reaction temperature to below room temperature favours the kinetic 1,2 adduct, 3-bromo-1-butene.[8]




The rationale for the differing selectivities is as follows: Both products result from Markovnikov protonation at position 1, resulting in a resonance-stabilized allylic cation. The 1,4 adduct places the larger Br atom at a less congested site and includes a more highly substituted alkene moiety, while the 1,2 adduct is the result of the attack by the nucleophile (Br−) at the carbon of the allylic cation bearing the greatest positive charge (the more highly substituted carbon is the most likely place for the positive charge).




Characteristics[edit]

In every reaction, the first product formed is that which is most easily formed. Thus, every reaction a priori starts under kinetic control.[9]
A necessary condition for thermodynamic control is reversibility or a mechanism permitting the equilibration between products. Reactions are considered to take place under thermodynamic reaction control when the reverse reaction is sufficiently rapid that the equilibrium establishes itself within the allotted reaction time. In this way, the thermodynamically more stable product is always favoured.
Under kinetic reaction control, the forward reaction is faster than the reverse reaction. After reaction time t, the product ratio is the ratio of rate constants k and thus a function of the difference in activation energies Ea or ΔG‡:

     (equation 1)


Unless equilibration is prevented, pure kinetic control is practically impossible, because equilibration will have started before the reactants will have been entirely consumed.


Under pure thermodynamic reaction control, when the equilibrium has been reached, the product distribution will be a function of the stabilities G°. After an infinite amount of reaction time, the ratio of product concentrations will equal the equilibrium constant Keq and therefore be a function of the difference in Gibbs free energies,

     (equation 2)


In general, short reaction times favour kinetic control, whereas longer reaction times favour thermodynamic reaction control. Low temperatures will enhance the selectivity under both sets of conditions, since T is in the denominator in both cases. The ideal temperature to optimise the yield of the fastest-forming product will be the lowest temperature that will ensure reaction completion in a reasonable amount of time.[10] The ideal temperature for a reaction under thermodynamic control is the lowest temperature at which equilibrium will be reached in a reasonable amount of time.[11] If needed, the selectivity can be increased by then slowly cooling the reaction mixture to shift the equilibrium further toward the most stable product. When the difference in product stability is very large, the thermodynamically controlled product can dominate even under relatively vigorous reaction conditions.
If a reaction is under thermodynamic control at a given temperature, it will also be under thermodynamic control at a higher temperature for the same reaction time.
In the same manner, if a reaction is under kinetic control at a given temperature, it will also be under kinetic control at any lower temperature for the same reaction time.
If one presumes that a new reaction will be a priori under kinetic control, one can detect the presence of an equilibration mechanism (and therefore the possibility of thermodynamic control) if the product distribution:

changes over time,
shows one product to be dominant at one temperature while another dominates at a different temperature (inversion of dominance), or
changes with temperature but is not consistent with equation 1, that is a change in temperature (without changing the reaction time) causes a change in the product ratio

History[edit]
The first to report on the relationship between kinetic and thermodynamic control were R.B. Woodward and Harold Baer in 1944.[14] They were re-investigating a reaction between maleic anhydride and a fulvene first reported in 1929 by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder.[15] They observed that while the endo isomer is formed more rapidly, longer reaction times, as well as relatively elevated temperatures, result in higher exo / endo ratios which had to be considered in the light of the remarkable stability of the exo-compound on the one hand and the very facile dissociation of the endo isomer on the other.



C. K. Ingold with E. D. Hughes and G. Catchpole independently described a thermodynamic and kinetic reaction control model in 1948.[16] They were reinvestigating a certain allylic rearrangement reported in 1930 by Jakob Meisenheimer.[17] Solvolysis of gamma-phenylallyl chloride with AcOK in acetic acid was found to give a mixture of the gamma and the alpha acetate with the latter converting to the first by equilibration. This was interpreted as a case in the field of anionotropy of the phenomenon, familiar in prototropy, of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control in ion-recombination.

Energy profile diagram for kinetic versus thermodynamic product reaction.


Thermodynamic reaction control or kinetic reaction control in a chemical reaction can decide the composition in a reaction product mixture when competing pathways lead to different products and the reaction conditions influence the selectivity or stereoselectivity. The distinction is relevant when product A forms faster than product B because the activation energy for product A is lower than that for product B, yet product B is more stable. In such a case A is the kinetic product and is favoured under kinetic control and B is the thermodynamic product and is favoured under thermodynamic control.[1][2][3]
The conditions of the reaction, such as temperature, pressure, or solvent, affect which reaction pathway may be favored: either the kinetically controlled or the thermodynamically controlled one. Note this is only true if the activation energy of the two pathways differ, with one pathway having a lower Ea (energy of activation) than the other.
Prevalence of thermodynamic or kinetic control determines the final composition of the product when these competing reaction pathways lead to different products. The reaction conditions as mentioned above influence the selectivity of the reaction - i.e., which pathway is taken.

Scope[edit]
In Diels-Alder reactions[edit]
The Diels-Alder reaction of cyclopentadiene with furan can produce two isomeric products. At room temperature, kinetic reaction control prevails and the less stable endo isomer 2 is the main reaction product. At 81 °C and after long reaction times, the chemical equilibrium can assert itself and the thermodynamically more stable exo isomer 1 is formed[citation needed]. The exo product is more stable by virtue of a lower degree of steric congestion, while the endo product is favoured by orbital overlap in the transition state.



In enolate chemistry[edit]
In the protonation of an enolate ion, the kinetic product is the enol and the thermodynamic product is a ketone or aldehyde. Carbonyl compounds and their enols interchange rapidly by proton transfers catalyzed by acids or bases, even in trace amounts, in this case mediated by the enolate or the proton source.
In the deprotonation of an unsymmetrical ketone, the kinetic product is the enolate resulting from removal of the most accessible α-H while the thermodynamic product has the more highly substituted enolate moiety.[4][5][6][7] Use of low temperatures and sterically demanding bases increases the kinetic selectivity. Here, the difference in pKb between the base and the enolate is so large that the reaction is essentially irreversible, so the equilibration leading to the thermodynamic product is likely a proton exchange occurring during the addition between the kinetic enolate and as-yet-unreacted ketone. An inverse addition (adding ketone to the base) with rapid mixing would minimize this. The position of the equilibrium will depend on the countercation and solvent.




If a much weaker base is used, the deprotonation will be incomplete, and there will be an equilibrium between reactants and products. Thermodynamic control is obtained, however the reaction remains incomplete unless the product enolate is trapped, as in the example below. Since H transfers are very fast, the trapping reaction being slower, the ratio of trapped products largely mirrors the deprotonation equilibrium.




In electrophilic additions[edit]
The electrophilic addition reaction of hydrogen bromide to 1,3-butadiene above room temperature leads predominantly to the thermodynamically more stable 1,4 adduct, 1-bromo-2-butene, but decreasing the reaction temperature to below room temperature favours the kinetic 1,2 adduct, 3-bromo-1-butene.[8]




The rationale for the differing selectivities is as follows: Both products result from Markovnikov protonation at position 1, resulting in a resonance-stabilized allylic cation. The 1,4 adduct places the larger Br atom at a less congested site and includes a more highly substituted alkene moiety, while the 1,2 adduct is the result of the attack by the nucleophile (Br−) at the carbon of the allylic cation bearing the greatest positive charge (the more highly substituted carbon is the most likely place for the positive charge).




Characteristics[edit]

In every reaction, the first product formed is that which is most easily formed. Thus, every reaction a priori starts under kinetic control.[9]
A necessary condition for thermodynamic control is reversibility or a mechanism permitting the equilibration between products. Reactions are considered to take place under thermodynamic reaction control when the reverse reaction is sufficiently rapid that the equilibrium establishes itself within the allotted reaction time. In this way, the thermodynamically more stable product is always favoured.
Under kinetic reaction control, the forward reaction is faster than the reverse reaction. After reaction time t, the product ratio is the ratio of rate constants k and thus a function of the difference in activation energies Ea or ΔG‡:

     (equation 1)


Unless equilibration is prevented, pure kinetic control is practically impossible, because equilibration will have started before the reactants will have been entirely consumed.


Under pure thermodynamic reaction control, when the equilibrium has been reached, the product distribution will be a function of the stabilities G°. After an infinite amount of reaction time, the ratio of product concentrations will equal the equilibrium constant Keq and therefore be a function of the difference in Gibbs free energies,

     (equation 2)


In general, short reaction times favour kinetic control, whereas longer reaction times favour thermodynamic reaction control. Low temperatures will enhance the selectivity under both sets of conditions, since T is in the denominator in both cases. The ideal temperature to optimise the yield of the fastest-forming product will be the lowest temperature that will ensure reaction completion in a reasonable amount of time.[10] The ideal temperature for a reaction under thermodynamic control is the lowest temperature at which equilibrium will be reached in a reasonable amount of time.[11] If needed, the selectivity can be increased by then slowly cooling the reaction mixture to shift the equilibrium further toward the most stable product. When the difference in product stability is very large, the thermodynamically controlled product can dominate even under relatively vigorous reaction conditions.
If a reaction is under thermodynamic control at a given temperature, it will also be under thermodynamic control at a higher temperature for the same reaction time.
In the same manner, if a reaction is under kinetic control at a given temperature, it will also be under kinetic control at any lower temperature for the same reaction time.
If one presumes that a new reaction will be a priori under kinetic control, one can detect the presence of an equilibration mechanism (and therefore the possibility of thermodynamic control) if the product distribution:

changes over time,
shows one product to be dominant at one temperature while another dominates at a different temperature (inversion of dominance), or
changes with temperature but is not consistent with equation 1, that is a change in temperature (without changing the reaction time) causes a change in the product ratio

History[edit]
The first to report on the relationship between kinetic and thermodynamic control were R.B. Woodward and Harold Baer in 1944.[14] They were re-investigating a reaction between maleic anhydride and a fulvene first reported in 1929 by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder.[15] They observed that while the endo isomer is formed more rapidly, longer reaction times, as well as relatively elevated temperatures, result in higher exo / endo ratios which had to be considered in the light of the remarkable stability of the exo-compound on the one hand and the very facile dissociation of the endo isomer on the other.



C. K. Ingold with E. D. Hughes and G. Catchpole independently described a thermodynamic and kinetic reaction control model in 1948.[16] They were reinvestigating a certain allylic rearrangement reported in 1930 by Jakob Meisenheimer.[17] Solvolysis of gamma-phenylallyl chloride with AcOK in acetic acid was found to give a mixture of the gamma and the alpha acetate with the latter converting to the first by equilibration. This was interpreted as a case in the field of anionotropy of the phenomenon, familiar in prototropy, of the distinction between kinetic and thermodynamic control in ion-recombination.

Latest Customer Reviews




As usual, it is working wonderfully. The customer was dumbfounded on how quick the unit snaps to setpoint and holds.–A Gas Mixing Customer


I’ve had to work with Alicat staff several times, and I cannot believe how much effort your guys put into helping us out. Out of every vendor and company we’ve ever worked into in the prototyping industry, Alicat has always been a positive experience. I don’t know how your staff stays so positive knowing that they live in Arizona.–A Prototyping Customer


No complaints here, you guys did everything you said you would – when you said you would. And the unit is the star of the lab.–An Industrial Manufacturing Customer


I have been using Alicat Flow Meters, Pressure Meters and Pressure Controllers since 2006, so far I am happy with the product and the service from you guys, I feel that I am buying more than the instrument itself, I feel more like I am buying a working solution, even though this might sound cliché, is how I see Alicat, good job!!–An Appliance Manufacturing Customer


Thanks for such a quick response on this. I have to say you have exceeded my timing expectation; I have yet to receive a single call back from your competitors. We will keep you in mind for future flow projects.–An Automotive Manufacturing Customer


Just wanted to let you know I am a big fan of Alicat’s pressure and flow controllers and flow meters as well. They have solved many testing problems for me over the years. Great products you are marketing!–A Plastics Manufacturing Customer


I’ve been really happy with the flowmeter so far. I’ve used it a few times in the field to calibrate and verify flows on TEOMs and BAMs. So far, it responds quickly and has given us accurate flows. It’s particularly handy at a monitoring site I run on a rooftop, because I can read the screen from ground level. That means I can look at different flow rates without having to keep climbing up and down the ladder.–An Ambient Air Monitoring Customer


I wanted to tell you that I have had a wonderful experience with your company. Your customer service team is great, I got answers back quickly, and overall I am very satisfied. Whatever you are doing, keep doing it! You get an A++ for me!–An Electronics Manufacturing Customer


We like your fast turn on orders.–A Biotechnology Customer


Alicat mass air flow meters have proven to be accurate, so accurate that we use them to calibrate other instruments.
Another advantage over others we have used is how steady the read out is; what a difference this makes when one is trying to record values!–A Spray Painting Customer


Please thank Jesse for his help getting the custom order in place and processed for timely delivery. I can honestly say that we are very pleased with the MFCs, flow meters, and pressure controllers from Alicat that we already have on site; we have a few from other Mfrs but definitely prefer the ease of use, options available and excellent performance in the units from Alicat.
–A Bioreactor Customer


I choose Alicat because of your excellent delivery time and low cost. You also have a good reputation among users.–An HVAC Customer


I was lucky enough to get my hands on (quite literally) a Whisper in Atlanta, Ga during the NAAMC conference this year. As I was looking it over and talking with the nice folks at the booth I had a vision of myself doing a flow verification on my API calibrator in minutes and not hours. I took a flyer and presented it to my boss again and again and again. We just bought a higher flow unit so I can calibrate all the MFC’s in our calibrators and our orifices for particulate work. I’m excited!
–An Air Particulate Monitoring Customer

Flow Reading Questions


The meter's flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow.
The differential pressure sensor may be damaged. Avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of 75 psid (15 psid for “Whisper” Series instruments). A common cause of this problem is instantaneous application of high-pressure gas as from a snap acting solenoid valve upstream of the meter. Damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty.

The controller's flow reading is approximately fixed either near zero or near full scale regardless of actual line flow.
Differential pressure sensor may be damaged. Avoid installations that can subject sensor to pressure drops in excess of 75 psid (15 psid for “Whisper” Series instruments). While in most cases the valve will help to protect the sensor against large pressure drops, a sudden change in pressures can subject the sensor to high pressure drops if the valve does not have enough time to adjust.  Damage due to excessive pressure differential is not covered by warranty.

The meter's flow reading is fixed at zero regardless of actual flow rate.
Alicat mass flow meters are equipped with a tare function via grounding a specified pin.  Please check electrical connections to ensure this pin is not grounded.  Pin out diagrams are available in the back of the manual for your reference.

The meter reads negative flow when there is a confirmed no flow condition.
This is an indication of an improper tare. If the meter is tared while there is flow, that flow is accepted as zero flow. When an actual zero flow condition exists, the meter will read a negative flow. Simply re-tare at the confirmed zero flow condition. Also note that while the meter is intended for positive flow, it will read negative flow with reasonable accuracy (it is not calibrated for bidirectional flow) and no damage will result.

The flow flutters or is jumpy.
The meters are very fast and will pick up any actual flow fluctuations such as from a diaphragm pump, etc. Also, inspect the inside of the upstream connection for debris such a Teflon tape shreds. Mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average (GRA) for both pressure and flow rate measurements that can aid in allowing fluctuating flow to be read. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications.

The meter does not agree with another meter I have in line.
Volumetric meters will often not agree with one another when put in series because they are affected by pressure drops. Volumetric flow meters should not be compared to mass flow meters. Mass flow meters can be compared against one another provided there are no leaks between the two meters and they are set to the same standard temperature and pressure. Both meters must also be calibrated (or set) for the gas being measured. M Series mass flow meters are normally set to Standard Temperature and Pressure conditions of 25° C and 14.695 PSIA. The standard temperature and pressure can be changed via the front panel and serial communications. It can also be ordered with specialty standard temperature and pressure.

My volumetric meter reading is strange, inconsistent, or incorrect.
Make sure you use a volumetric flow meter only under low pressure (close to atmospheric) and with little to no back pressure for accurate readings. Mass meters should be used for higher pressure applications.

The device jumps to zero at low flow.
Mass flow and pressure devices feature a programmable deadband or zero band. The factory setting is usually 0.5% of full scale. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications.


Gas Compatibility Concerns


My device has a specific gas listed in the part number. Can I use it with other gases?
Absolutely! The gas that appears in the part number is what your unit has been pre-selected to when you received it from the factory. You will still have access to Gas Select™ 5.0 which has 98 or more preloaded gas calibrations to choose from as well as our COMPOSER™ firmware which allows you to create up to 20 custom gas compositions.

I accidentally selected the wrong gas. What can I do?
Both the mass flow rate and volumetric flow rate depend on the viscosity of the gas. If a different gas is selected than what is flowing through the device, the flow rates will be off by approximately the ratio of the viscosities. Simply take your reading and multiply by the ratio of the selected gas’s viscosity to the desired gas’s viscosity.
A detailed description with examples can be found at www.alicat.com/faq/accidentally-wrong-gas-selected-can.


Communications Help


The display does not come on or is weak.
Check power and ground connections.

The output signal is lower than the reading at the display.
This can occur if the output signal is measured some distance from the meter as voltage drops in the wires increase with distance. Using heavier gauge wires, especially in the ground wire, can reduce this effect.

The device is responding slower than expected.
Mass flow devices feature a programmable geometric running average (GRA) for both pressure and flow rate measurements that may lead to a slower perceived response time. This can be adjusted via the front panel or serial communications. Controllers also have programmable valve tuning available via the front panel and serial communications which can further improve the response time.

My device is locked and 'LCK' is showing on the screen
Alicat devices come with a locking option for applications in which the buttons may accidentally be pressed changing crucial device settings. Devices with newer firmware revisions can be unlocked by pressing and holding the outer four buttons on the front panel. All devices can be unlocked via serial communications. Please follow the steps below.


Download Serial Terminal from www.alicat.com/support/software-drivers.
Make sure all drivers associated with the cables are installed. Please look for any discs that came with the cables.
Open the “Control Panel” and then open “Device Manager”.
Under “Ports”, find the COM number the Alicat is connected to and write this down for later.
Open Serial Terminal
Serial Terminal will ask for the COM port and baud rate.  Enter the COM port you found in part 2 and a baud rate of 19200.
Type A$$U and press enter.
Your device should now be unlocked!


Occasionally the device unit ID may be different than A.  If A$$U does not unlock, try B$$U or C$$U, etc all the way to Z$$U.  To change the unit ID back to A, you can type *@=A and press enter to give all connected devices a unit ID of A.

The RS-232 Serial Communications is not responding.
Check that your unit is powered and connected properly. Be sure that the port on the computer to which the unit is connected is active. Confirm that the port settings are correct per the RS-232 instructions in this manual. When connecting multiple devices to a single COM port, please ensure that all devices have a unique unit ID.

The BB9 multi-drop box isn't showing up under COM ports in my device manager.

If the BB9 multi-drop box is showing up under “other” in your device manager instead of “Ports (COM & LPT)”, the most likely cause is missing drivers. While these should install automatically when plugging into your computer, occasionally security settings can prohibit them from installing. Please try installing the drivers directly from www.alicat.com/drivers.
If using a USB port with Windows 7 and an error pops up saying “One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and Windows does not recognize it”, the USB port itself is having issues. Microsoft has released a solution on one of their forums at www.answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/one-of-the-usb-devices-attached-to-your-computer/b8a2fc66-5e58-48a3-9d3b-1db2858c3a9e.
If using the 9 pin serial connection on your computer and nothing shows up in device manager, it’s possible the COM port on the computer has died. BB9 multi-drop boxes come with cables to connect to 9 pin serial ports or USB ports. Please try connecting to the computer using a different port and checking the device manager again.


FlowVisionSC or FlowVisionMX is displaying an error beginning with &quotMethod not found: 'System.String...'&quot
FlowVisionSC and FlowVisionMX require the most recent Microsoft .NET framework.  Please find the most recent available .NET framework at www.microsoft.com/net/download/framework.
