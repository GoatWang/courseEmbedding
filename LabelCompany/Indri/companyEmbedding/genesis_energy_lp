  About Genesis Energy






















































About Genesis Energy
Areas of Operation and Leadership


























A Midstream Energy Company
Genesis Energy, L.P., is a growth-oriented master limited partnership headquartered in Houston, Texas.  Through our four divisions: offshore pipeline transportation, refinery services, marine transportation and supply and logistics, we provide an integrated suite of services to refineries, oil producers, and industrial and commercial enterprises. Our operations are primarily located in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Wyoming and the Gulf of Mexico.
Our business activities are primarily focused on providing services around and within refinery complexes. Upstream of refineries, we provide gathering and transportation of crude oil. Within refineries, we provide services to assist in their sulfur balancing requirements. Downstream of refineries, we provide transportation services as well as market outlets for the finished refined products. We have a diverse portfolio of customers, operations and assets, including pipelines, refinery-related plants, storage tanks and terminals, railcars, rail loading and unloading facilities, barges and trucks.
We also have interests in pipelines offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. That business includes approximately 2,600 miles of offshore crude oil and natural gas pipelines and six offshore hub platforms that serve some of the most active drilling and development regions in the United States, including deepwater production fields in the Gulf of Mexico offshore of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
Safety, health and the environment are at the center of our operations. Our regard for the safety of our employees, contractors, and the communities in which we operate is evident in our project design, construction and day to day operations.

Leadership
The Genesis Energy leadership team is focused on growing value for unit holders by continuing to deliver disciplined, low double-digit growth and growing our distribution coverage ratio without ever losing our strong commitment to providing safe, responsible and reliable operations.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.
