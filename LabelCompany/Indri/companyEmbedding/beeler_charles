Beelers Pork


Beeler’s Pork
 11 central avenue nw
le mars, ia 51031
phone 712.546.4402
fax 712.546.6748


The story behind beeler’s pork
 The Beeler pork tradition started in 1846 when our great-great Grandpa Fred immigrated from Germany to the gently rolling hills of Madison County, Iowa. On his farmstead, Grandpa Beeler began raising hogs. 
Grandpa Beeler’s agricultural endeavors found success when he loaded his provisions into his horse-drawn wagon and left Truro for Denver, Colorado. The trip took nearly six months total, but was successful enough to warrant future trips. 
Now, six generations later, our family is still carrying-on the tradition of raising and marketing a pork product consumers love. 
 


Of course, in Grandpa Beeler’s day, raising pork was much different than today’s methods. The younger generation, thinking they knew everything, tried to build a better mousetrap by incorporating technology into our production methods. However, they have finally realized Grandpa Beeler’s Old World method of raising pork was not so bad after all. Thus, they have come full circle utilizing some of today’s hi-tech methods with his Old World ways.
Developing what they perceive to be the best combination of the old and the new has resulted in their new HELUKA® method for raising pork. Hidden away in the Loess Hills of Western Iowa is a very unique farm: the birthplace of HELUKA® pork. Our HELUKA® farms embrace a new freewheeling life style for the pigs that live there.  
If you like our HELUKA® pork, you’ll love our HELUKA® method! 
As with all Beeler pork, HELUKA® pork is natural, meaning Beeler pigs are raised without any antibiotics or growth promotants whatsoever, and are never fed animal by-products. Their diets consist of all vegetarian ingredients: corn, soybean meal, vitamins, and minerals. 
However, that is where natural ends…   and HELUKA® begins.





The Beeler Difference
Our Heluka® pork was developed with two things in mind: the welfare of their pigs and the palate of our consumers. To satisfy both, they have developed their own exclusive Heluka® production model and breed. This system ensures that their pigs are raised with compassion, and that your dining experience will be exceptional, consistent, wholesome, and safe for your family.
 At Beeler’s they prefer their own standards, set by their own Heluka® method.
Heluka® Welfare 
When the Heluka® method was developed, the welfare of our pigs was not only in mind, it was our TOP priority!
  In fact, this model is so important to us, we feel the farming system we’ve developed is greater than the product itself. Heluka® farms do not use farrowing crates; our sows give birth in their own private, bedded maternity rooms. These rooms have been uniquely designed to allow mamas the freedom to get up and move around at will. Bedding is provided so mamas can nest comfortably with their babies. 
Heluka® farms do not use gestation crates; our sows live together in groups. Our gestation barns have deep-bedded areas where our sows are free to root, graze, and lounge comfortably. The sows have free access to a food and water court and an outdoor play area where they are free to move about, socialize, and exercise in the fresh air and sunshine.  
Heluka® farms allow babies to grow in a comfortable, spacious, and social environment. Once weaned, our baby pigs are taken from their maternity room to another specially designed Heluka® house where theyare free to romp, root, run, and play with one another in their deep-bedded and outdoor areas. 
Regardless of where the pigs are, they always have lots of sunshine!


 
 Heluka® Genetics
Because pork does not have to be artificially enhanced to taste flavorful, we have developed the Heluka® breed to deliver a good, flavorful taste. Our “Heluka® boar” was developed from an early heritage breed. This particular boar was created based on his genetic ability to produce great tasting, naturally flavorful pork without artificial enhancement.
The heirloom breed of sow on our Heluka® farms was chosen for her notorious ability to act as a good mama. Because we only utilize one specific genetic breed to develop the Heluka® boar and the Heluka® mama, we offer a truly consistent product that tastes the way pork traditionally did before preservatives and artificial flavorings were the norm. 
Only Beeler’s can offer you the exclusive HELUKA® product!

Charles A Beeler
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Iowa:













Does Charles A Beeler carry a valid contracting license?



Although a contractor license is not required in the state of Iowa, contractors earning more than $2000 per year from construction related work must register their business with the Iowa Division of Labor.
Charles A Beeler currently holds license 7156 (Master Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Iowa?



In Iowa, general contractors are not required to pass an exam to become licensed. However, plumbing and electrical contractors do have to pass a trade exam to obtain a license in Iowa.











Your liability risk when hiring Charles A Beeler



Registered contractors in Iowa are required to carry an active workers' compensation policy. In addition to workers' compensation insurance, it is always a good idea to hire contractors with general liability insurance. Be sure to request copies of certificates for both workers' compensation and general liabilty insurance 











Financial recourse when hiring Charles A Beeler



Iowa contractors are required to obtain a surety bond. Homeowners can file a claim against this bond in the event of faulty work or damaged property. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work.You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Iowa, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
