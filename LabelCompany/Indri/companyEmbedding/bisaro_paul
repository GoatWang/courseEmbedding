And Muslims' fears that Israel wants it for their own religious and national purposes are, unfortunately, well grounded.

Tel Aviv wants to wrest control of it back for Israel, because in Jewish religious traditions, the building of the 3rd Temple will herald the beginning of the Messianic age.

Israeli Prime Minister knew that the optics of the metal detectors and forbidding anyone under 50 to worship at Al Aqsa would be horrific; but in his characteristic hubris, he just didn't give a damn.

Through these actions, he may well have lit the flames for yet another intifada; then, he will use this violence as "the justification" to tighten down the screws against Palestinians even more than they are already.

I weep for all those dead and wounded, Jewish, Muslim, and Christian, and those who will die, and be wounded, on all sides; this is an absolute tragedy which could have been averted.

A violent response to these strictures for worshiping at Al Aqsa was precisely the outcome Netanyahu, and the Israeli government wanted to happen.Join the Conversation1 / 5599

    Bisaro

 

    Paul M. Bisaro, age 48, was appointed President and Chief
    Executive Officer effective September 4, 2007. Prior to
    joining Watson, Mr. Bisaro was President and Chief
    Operating Officer of Barr from 1999 to 2007. Between 1992 and

    1999 served in various additional capacities including Senior
    Vice President  Strategic Business Development. Prior

    as a Senior Consultant with Arthur Andersen & Co.
    Mr. Bisaro received his undergraduate degree in General

    Bisaro.

 

    Pursuant to his employment agreement Mr. Bisaro was
    eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 100% of his base
    salary, prorated for the portion of the year Mr. Bisaro was
    employed as our chief executive officer, based on our financial
    performance in 2007 as measured by the Adjusted EBITDA targets
    established at the beginning of the year. Mr. Bisaros
    target bonus opportunity was determined following negotiations
    with Mr. Bisaro which considered, among other things, the
    significant impact Mr. Bisaro would have on our ability to
    meet our targets and his compensation opportunities with his
    previous employer. The Committee also considered that the median
    bonus payment for the most recent fiscal year among our peer
    group companies was approximately 109% for chief executive
    officers. As a results of our actual Adjusted EBITDA results for
    2007 exceeding our target for 100% funding, and
    Mr. Bisaros service from September 4, 2007 to
    the end of the year, the Committee determined that a cash
    incentive of $330,000 would be awarded to Mr. Bisaro for
    performance in 2007.

 

    For 2008, the Committee approved a bonus program pursuant to
    which Mr. Bisaro will be eligible to receive a cash bonus
    of up to 100% of his then current salary. Up to 70% of
    Mr. Bisaros award will be based upon our financial
    performance in 2008 as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, and up 30%
    of Mr. Bisaros award will be at the discretion of the
    Committee, taking into account Mr. Bisaros success in:

 







 
     


    setting and implementing strategies to develop and grow the our
    Generic, Brand and Distribution business segments;





    15



Table of Contents

 







 
     


    implementing our global supply chain cost improvement
    initiatives, including the integration of our offshore
    operations;


 

 
     


    improving our quality systems and procedures; and


 

 
     


    identifying and retaining key executives, recruiting key
    executives and developing succession plans for our senior
    leaders.



 

    The Committee may consider other relevant factors in its sole
    discretion. The Committee will determine whether, and to what
    extent a bonus will be paid to Mr. Bisaro for fiscal year
    2008 after the end of 2008.

 

Annual
    Cash Incentive Awards for our Named Executive
    Officers.  
    

 

    Each year, the Committee adopts a program that provides
    guidelines pursuant to which it calculates the annual cash
    incentive awards available to our named executive officers,
    other than our chief executive officer, subject to the
    Committees oversight and modification. The Committee
    believes that our annual incentive plan provides our named
    executive officers with a team incentive to both enhance our
    financial performance and perform at the highest level. The
    terms of these programs are not contained in a formal written
    plan.

 

    Under our 2007 cash incentive program each of our named
    executive officers, other than our chief executive officer, was
    eligible to receive an annual cash bonus targeted at a specified
    percentage of his or her base salary. For 2007 these percentages
    were: 55% for Mr. Russillo; 50% for Mr. Heimers; 45%
    for Mr. Buchen; and 30% for Mr. Joyce. In setting our
    named executive officers target bonus opportunities, the
    Committee considered that the 2006 target total cash
    compensation levels of Messrs. Russillo, Heimers, Buchen
    and Joyce compared to the market
    50th percentile
    for their positions. Mr. Durand, who joined us on
    November 16, 2007, was not eligible for a cash incentive
    award for our 2007 performance. Pursuant to the terms of his
    employment agreement, Mr. Durands target bonus level
    will be not less than 50% of his base salary.

 

    The bonus actually paid to each named executive officer could
    have ranged from 0% to 150% of the named executive
    officers target bonus, depending to varying degrees on
    (i) our financial performance in 2007 as measured by
    Adjusted EBITDA, (ii) the contribution of the named
    executive officers business segment to our performance
    (where applicable) and (iii) the evaluation of the named
    executive officer and his or her department during 2007 as
    determined by our chief executive officer based on the
    executives and his departments achievements during
    2007. For 2007 the above factors were applied as follows in
    determining the annual cash incentive award due to each of our
    named executive officers:

 







 
     


    For Mr. Heimers, fifty percent (50%) of his award was based
    upon our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA and fifty
    percent (50%) of his award was based on the Adjusted
    Contribution of our Brand business segment to our financial
    results. Mr. Heimers received a cash bonus of $226,843,
    which reflected our actual Adjusted EBITDA of
    $545.4 million, Adjusted Contribution of our Brand business
    segment at the 150% level and the recommendation of our chief
    executive officer.


 

 
     


    For Mr. Russillo, fifty percent (50%) of his award was
    based upon our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA and
    fifty percent (50%) of his award was based on the Adjusted
    Contribution of our Generic business segment to our financial
    results. Mr. Russillo received a cash bonus of $500,116,
    which reflected (i) our actual Adjusted EBITDA of
    $545.4 million, Adjusted Contribution of our Generic
    business segment at the 100% level and the recommendation of our
    chief executive officer and (ii) an additional bonus equal
    to 15% of Mr. Russillos base salary based on his
    attainment of certain strategic initiatives approved by the
    Committee.


 

 
     


    For Mr. Buchen sixty percent (60%) of his award was based
    upon our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA and forty
    percent (40%) of his award was based on his performance
    evaluation by our chief executive officer as recommended to the
    Committee. Mr. Buchen received a cash bonus of $245,916,
    which reflected our actual Adjusted EBITDA of
    $545.4 million, the recommendation of our chief executive
    officer and the exercise of the Committees discretion.

     


    For Mr. Joyce sixty percent (60%) of his award was based
    upon our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA and forty
    percent (40%) of his award was based on his performance
    evaluation by our chief executive officer as recommended to the
    Committee. Mr. Joyce received a cash bonus of $112,570,
    which reflected our actual Adjusted EBITDA of
    $545.4 million, the recommendation of our chief executive
    officer and the exercise of the Committees discretion.



 

    The calculations of the cash incentive awards and the
    recommendation of our chief executive officer are submitted to
    the Committee for consideration and approval. The total amount
    of cash bonus payable to a named executive officer may be
    further adjusted by up to twenty five percent (25%) at the
    discretion of the Committee. The Committee determines whether
    and to what extent cash incentive awards will be paid for a
    fiscal year after the end of that fiscal year.
