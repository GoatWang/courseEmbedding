Buffalo Wild Wings rolls out loyalty program nationwide
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  said Monday that it is rolling out its loyalty program, Blazin' Rewards, nationwide. The restaurant chain launched an initial pilot in late 2015 and expanded it last summer. It has accumulated more than two million members across the U.S. Members earn points for eligible purchases of $10 or more, checking into restaurants, through email offers, and other methods. Buffalo Wild Wings recently announced that it's piloting B-Dubs Express, a restaurant format focused on takeout and delivery. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are down 17.2% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index  is up 9% for the period.

Buffalo Wild Wings shares jump after CEO Sally Smith announces plan to retire
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  shares are up 4% in Friday trading after the company announced that Chief Executive Sally Smith will retire by the end of the year. She has also withdrawn her name for election to the board. The board will not nominate a replacement, but has begun the search process. Buffalo Wild Wings has been locked in a battle with activist investor Marcato Capital Management leading into the company's annual meeting, taking place today. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are up 6.5% for the past year while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 16%.

Buffalo Wild Wings shares downgraded on 'lose-lose' situation for shareholders
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Wedbush based on the belief that the upcoming proxy vote is a "lose-lose" for shareholders. Wedbush cut the price target to $115 from $150. "We view the outcome... as irrelevant given our view that neither alternative offers a viable solution to the company's ongoing deterioration in fundamentals," the Tuesday note said. Analysts believe same-store sales growth from management's strategy will be driven by promotions, which will hurt the average check size and drive margin deleverage. And there is additional risk to earnings guidance because the expected seasonal decline of wing costs won't happen. And analysts believe the alternative proposed by activist investors Marcato Capital Management, which includes refranchising, "makes less sense given recent fundamental deterioration." Marcato, which owns about 9.9% of Buffalo Wild Wings shares, issued an open letter to shareholders on Tuesday urging shareholders to vote for its director nominees and laying out its plan for the company, which includes a transition to a 90% franchised model. Buffalo Wild Wings' Chief Executive Sally Smith issued her own letter on Tuesday highlighting the positive same-store sales the company posted in the first quarter of 2017 and the changes the company is making to drive growth. "It is critical that we maintain institutional knowledge and memory on the board and it would be unwise, in my view, to jostle the careful balance we have achieved between fresh perspective and intimate knowledge of our operating model, company history and culture," Smith's letter said. Buffalo Wild Wings' annual meeting will take place on Friday. The company's shares are down 2.2% in Tuesday premarket trading, and down 2.2% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8% for 2017 to date.

Buffalo Wild Wings responds to activist investor, Mercato Capital Management
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  issued a statement Thursday in response to what it calls "misleading claims" made by activist investors, Mercato Capital Management. The restaurant chain says Mercato based its "flawed analysis" of the company's performance on comparisons with restaurants and retailers that are "meaningfully different," much larger companies, and broad market indices like the Nasdaq. "Buffalo Wild Wings should instead be compared to its casual dining peers," the company wrote. "The casual dining peer group utilized by Buffalo Wild Wings properly excludes companies that are quick-serve, fast-food or delivery restaurants as well as companies outside the restaurant industry." Among the companies it calls peers are Cheesecake Factory Inc. , Outback Steakhouse parent Bloomin' Brands Inc. , Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. , and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. . "Compared with the median returns generated by this set of our casual dining peers, Buffalo Wild Wings has generated significantly better returns for its shareholders," the statement said, adding that the company has had compounded annual returns of more than 24% annually since its IPO. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are unchanged in premarket trading and up 20.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 16.4% for the last 12 months.

Buffalo Wild Wings activist investor says its proposals could boost shares by 2 1/2 times in four years
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  activist investor Marcato Capital Management said in a letter to shareholders that voting to add its recommendations to the board could lift the stock to over $400 by 2021. That would be about 2 1/2-times Monday's closing price of $159.20. Marcato, which owns 6.1% of the casual dining chain's outstanding shares, urged shareholders to "hold the board and management accountable for unacceptable, persistent underperformance" of the stock. "We invested in Buffalo Wild Wings...because we believed that the shares were significantly undervalued with the potential to increase meaningfully over a multi-year investment horizon," the letter said. "After BWLD's management team and board repeatedly refused to engage in productive discussions with us regarding these opportunities, the company--once again--delivered disappointing financial results for the first quarter of 2017." Through Monday, the stock has shed 2% since the company reported first-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations. The stock has gained 3.1% year to date, while the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF  has rallied 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

Buffalo Wild Wings rolls out loyalty program nationwide
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  said Monday that it is rolling out its loyalty program, Blazin' Rewards, nationwide. The restaurant chain launched an initial pilot in late 2015 and expanded it last summer. It has accumulated more than two million members across the U.S. Members earn points for eligible purchases of $10 or more, checking into restaurants, through email offers, and other methods. Buffalo Wild Wings recently announced that it's piloting B-Dubs Express, a restaurant format focused on takeout and delivery. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are down 17.2% for the year to date while the S&P 500 index  is up 9% for the period.

Buffalo Wild Wings shares jump after CEO Sally Smith announces plan to retire
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  shares are up 4% in Friday trading after the company announced that Chief Executive Sally Smith will retire by the end of the year. She has also withdrawn her name for election to the board. The board will not nominate a replacement, but has begun the search process. Buffalo Wild Wings has been locked in a battle with activist investor Marcato Capital Management leading into the company's annual meeting, taking place today. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are up 6.5% for the past year while the S&P 500 index  is up nearly 16%.

Buffalo Wild Wings shares downgraded on 'lose-lose' situation for shareholders
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  was downgraded to underperform from neutral at Wedbush based on the belief that the upcoming proxy vote is a "lose-lose" for shareholders. Wedbush cut the price target to $115 from $150. "We view the outcome... as irrelevant given our view that neither alternative offers a viable solution to the company's ongoing deterioration in fundamentals," the Tuesday note said. Analysts believe same-store sales growth from management's strategy will be driven by promotions, which will hurt the average check size and drive margin deleverage. And there is additional risk to earnings guidance because the expected seasonal decline of wing costs won't happen. And analysts believe the alternative proposed by activist investors Marcato Capital Management, which includes refranchising, "makes less sense given recent fundamental deterioration." Marcato, which owns about 9.9% of Buffalo Wild Wings shares, issued an open letter to shareholders on Tuesday urging shareholders to vote for its director nominees and laying out its plan for the company, which includes a transition to a 90% franchised model. Buffalo Wild Wings' Chief Executive Sally Smith issued her own letter on Tuesday highlighting the positive same-store sales the company posted in the first quarter of 2017 and the changes the company is making to drive growth. "It is critical that we maintain institutional knowledge and memory on the board and it would be unwise, in my view, to jostle the careful balance we have achieved between fresh perspective and intimate knowledge of our operating model, company history and culture," Smith's letter said. Buffalo Wild Wings' annual meeting will take place on Friday. The company's shares are down 2.2% in Tuesday premarket trading, and down 2.2% for the year so far. The S&P 500 index  is up 8% for 2017 to date.

Buffalo Wild Wings responds to activist investor, Mercato Capital Management
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  issued a statement Thursday in response to what it calls "misleading claims" made by activist investors, Mercato Capital Management. The restaurant chain says Mercato based its "flawed analysis" of the company's performance on comparisons with restaurants and retailers that are "meaningfully different," much larger companies, and broad market indices like the Nasdaq. "Buffalo Wild Wings should instead be compared to its casual dining peers," the company wrote. "The casual dining peer group utilized by Buffalo Wild Wings properly excludes companies that are quick-serve, fast-food or delivery restaurants as well as companies outside the restaurant industry." Among the companies it calls peers are Cheesecake Factory Inc. , Outback Steakhouse parent Bloomin' Brands Inc. , Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc. , and Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Inc. . "Compared with the median returns generated by this set of our casual dining peers, Buffalo Wild Wings has generated significantly better returns for its shareholders," the statement said, adding that the company has had compounded annual returns of more than 24% annually since its IPO. Buffalo Wild Wings shares are unchanged in premarket trading and up 20.1% for the past year. The S&P 500 index  is up 16.4% for the last 12 months.

Buffalo Wild Wings activist investor says its proposals could boost shares by 2 1/2 times in four years
Buffalo Wild Wings Inc.  activist investor Marcato Capital Management said in a letter to shareholders that voting to add its recommendations to the board could lift the stock to over $400 by 2021. That would be about 2 1/2-times Monday's closing price of $159.20. Marcato, which owns 6.1% of the casual dining chain's outstanding shares, urged shareholders to "hold the board and management accountable for unacceptable, persistent underperformance" of the stock. "We invested in Buffalo Wild Wings...because we believed that the shares were significantly undervalued with the potential to increase meaningfully over a multi-year investment horizon," the letter said. "After BWLD's management team and board repeatedly refused to engage in productive discussions with us regarding these opportunities, the company--once again--delivered disappointing financial results for the first quarter of 2017." Through Monday, the stock has shed 2% since the company reported first-quarter profit and sales that missed expectations. The stock has gained 3.1% year to date, while the SPDR Consumer Discretionary Select Sector ETF  has rallied 11% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

History[edit]
Buffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]
Originally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]
The corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[9] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[10]
Concept[edit]
The chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous "Blazin Wing Challenge." They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[11] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[12] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.

History[edit]
Buffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]
Originally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]
The corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[9] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[10]
Concept[edit]
The chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous "Blazin Wing Challenge." They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[11] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[12] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.

Buffalo Wild Wings (originally, Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[2] thus the numeronym "BW3") is an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates, which specializes in Buffalo wings and sauces.




Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck logo


As of June 2017, it had 1,237 locations (625 directly owned by the company, and 612 franchised locations) across all 50 U.S. states and DC.[3] An alternate nickname in recent usage by the company is B-Dubs.[4][5]

History[edit]
Buffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]
Originally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]
The corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[9] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[10]
Concept[edit]
The chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous "Blazin Wing Challenge." They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[11] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[12] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.

Buffalo Wild Wings (originally, Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[2] thus the numeronym "BW3") is an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates, which specializes in Buffalo wings and sauces.




Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck logo


As of June 2017, it had 1,237 locations (625 directly owned by the company, and 612 franchised locations) across all 50 U.S. states and DC.[3] An alternate nickname in recent usage by the company is B-Dubs.[4][5]

History[edit]
Buffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]
Originally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]
The corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[9] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[10]
Concept[edit]
The chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous "Blazin Wing Challenge." They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[11] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[12] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.

Buffalo Wild Wings (originally, Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[2] thus the numeronym "BW3") is an American casual dining restaurant and sports bar franchise in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Arab Emirates, which specializes in Buffalo wings and sauces.




Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck logo


As of June 2017, it had 1,237 locations (625 directly owned by the company, and 612 franchised locations) across all 50 U.S. states and DC.[3] An alternate nickname in recent usage by the company is B-Dubs.[4][5]

History[edit]
Buffalo Wild Wings was founded in 1982 by Jim Disbrow, Scott Lowery, and Bernard Spencer. Disbrow, Lowery, and Spencer came up with the idea one weekend when they got together in Kent, Ohio, for Disbrow to judge an amateur figure skating competition at Kent State University in 1980. They decided to open up their own restaurant, first in Columbus, Ohio, and then in Westerville, Ohio one year later.[6]
Originally called Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck,[7] from which the abbreviation bw-3 was created (the third W was for the beef on weck sandwich, a staple of the Buffalo region), in 1990 Buffalo Wild Wings & Weck began to franchise. In 1998, the name was changed to Buffalo Wild Wings Grill & Bar.[8]
The corporate headquarters was located in Cincinnati, Ohio until 1997 when it moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota.
In 2010, the company announced an expansion into Canada.[9] In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings expanded in the United Arab Emirates when it opened a restaurant in Dubai.[10]
Concept[edit]
The chain is best known for Buffalo-style chicken wings along with over a dozen dipping sauces, as well as a complement of other items such as chicken tenders and legs. The chain's menu also features appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, and desserts, along with beer, wine, and other beverages. They are known for their famous "Blazin Wing Challenge." They challenge customers to eat 12 of their hottest wings under six minutes. The winners receive a free T-shirt and get their picture on their wall of fame. The restaurants feature an open layout with a bar area and patio seating flanked by over 50 televisions and media screens.[11] Starting in 2016, the new restaurants being built follow a new type of layout that gives the guests the feeling as if they were actually in a sports stadium. Server uniforms consist of gray shorts and jerseys with the number 82, signifying the year that the chain was established in 1982.[12] Not only is the chain attributable to its famous wings, beer, and sports, but it is also recognized as a big partner with the organization the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Multiple times a year, the company does fundraisers and accepts monetary donations that are later given to the Boys and Girls Club that allows them to participate in extracurricular and sporting events.

It would have opened when the old one closed but construction took a little longer than planned. It also got its name from people getting things in 3 like 3 buffalo wings. [1]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
