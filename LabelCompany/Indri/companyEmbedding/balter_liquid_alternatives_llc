BOSTON, June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Balter Liquid Alternatives LLC ("BLA"), one of the leading players in the growing liquid alternative business and subsidiary of Balter Capital Management ("BCM"), announced today the launch of the Balter Invenomic Fund (ticker: BIVIX), an all-cap long/short equity¹ mutual fund, sub-advised by Invenomic Capital Management, based in Boston.  Invenomic was founded by Ali Motamed, former Co-Portfolio Manager for the Boston Partners Long/Short Equity Fund (BPLSX).  He was Morningstar's Alternative Fund Manager of the year in 2014. 








BLA has entered into a strategic partnership with Invenomic and will run operations and compliance for the firm.  Motamed will utilize the same investment process that he developed during his time at Boston Partners.
Invenomic's investment process utilizes quantitative analysis on the front end coupled with fundamental analysis on the back end.  The quantitative process is used to source potentially attractive long and short ideas that then go through fundamental analysis to determine whether they are appropriate for the portfolio.  Motamed seeks to invest in companies that generate strong cash flows and deploy capital well on the long side and companies that are overvalued and destroy capital on the short side.  The fund will have a variable net exposure that will be dictated by short opportunities.  The fund's net exposure is expected to be low during overvalued markets and high during undervalued markets.  The fund will invest in both large and small companies predominately in the United States.
Brad Balter, CEO of Balter Liquid Alternatives LLC says, "We are thrilled to be partnering with Invenomic on the launch of this fund.  Our partnership with Invenomic further enhances our mission of bringing the highest quality alternative mutual funds in the industry to market.  The Balter Invenomic Fund continues our tradition of launching capacity constrained strategies run by experienced investment managers.  Ali is proven talent in managing liquid long/short equity portfolios and we couldn't be happier partnering with him and his firm."
Ali Motamed adds, "We are extremely excited to be partnering with Balter Liquid Alternatives to bring the Balter Invenomic Fund to investors. Brad and his team have a proven ability to deliver the highest levels of compliance and operational oversight, which will allow my team and I to dedicate ourselves to the investment process.  This partnership presents a unique opportunity for us to offer mutual fund investors what we believe has historically been a successful strategy outside the inherent constraints of a multi-billion investment firm."
Unlike traditional hedge funds, many alternative mutual funds provide daily liquidity, lower investment minimums, and simplified tax reporting for shareholders, while offering quarterly full transparency of portfolio holdings and lower fees.  BLA funds employ the investment approach, risk management and operational due diligence typically available only to institutional and high net worth investors through traditional hedge fund structures. 
"Liquid Alternatives are going through a period of consolidation where investors are trying to separate the wheat from the chaff," said Balter.  "The proliferation of new liquid alternative funds over the last three years have left investors seeking clarity on the numerous offerings available to the them.  Our mission remains the same, provide investors with the highest quality liquid alternative offerings in the industry."
About Balter Liquid Alternatives
Balter Liquid Alternatives (BLA) is a subsidiary of Balter Capital Management, a boutique research firm focused on hedge fund research and investing.  BLA was formed to create and manage daily liquidity alternative mutual funds.  Balter Capital Management oversees approximately $1.3 Billion in hedge fund and alternative mutual fund assets.  BLA constructs liquid investment products utilizing existing hedge fund managers.  For more information, please visit our website at www.balterliquidalts.com.

Mutual funds involve risks including the possible loss of principal.  There can be no assurance that the fund advisers will be effective in achieving the fund's investment objectives, delivering positive return or avoiding losses.  Additional information regarding the risks associated with an investment in each of the funds can be located in the fund's prospectus.   Short sales of securities may result in gains if a security's price declines, but may result in losses if a security's price rises. Liquidity does not ensure profit or prevent losses.
The Balter Funds are distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, member FINRA/SIPC.  Balter Liquid Alternatives is not affiliated with Northern Lights Distributors, LLC. 
¹Long/short equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure, while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions.

Balter Liquid Alternatives Launches Discretionary Global Macro Offering

Jun 03, 2015, 17:47 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Balter Liquid Alternatives LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


BOSTON, June 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Balter Liquid Alternatives LLC, one of the leading players in the growing liquid alternative business and subsidiary of Balter Capital Management, announced today the launch of Balter Discretionary Global Macro Fund (ticker: BGMIX) (the "Fund").  The Fund is sub-advised by Willowbridge Associates Inc.  The co-Portfolio Managers, Phil Yang and Frank Marrapodi, utilize Willowbridge's wPraxis Trading Approach (1X Leverage) strategy.  The Fund's objective is to seek to generate positive absolute returns in most market conditions, irrespective of the performance of broad market indices.  As a result, the performance of the Fund may not be correlated with the performance of broad equity or fixed income markets.
The Balter Discretionary Global Macro Fund follows the Balter Liquid Alternatives' initial '40 Act offering, the Balter Long/Short Equity Fund (ticker: BEQIX).  Each fund intends to provide high quality hedge fund managers running their strategies pari passu limited partnership vehicles, rather than the watered-down "hedge fund lite" options that have been commonplace to date.
Unlike traditional hedge funds, both funds provides daily liquidity, lower investment minimums, and simplified tax reporting for shareholders, while offering quarterly full transparency of portfolio holdings and lower fees.  They employ the investment approach, risk management and operational due diligence traditionally available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors through traditional hedge funds. 
"The Fund builds on our philosophy of making great managers available to a wider audience," said Brad Balter, CEO of Balter Liquid Alternatives.  "We believe that hedge fund industry dynamics have led to many managers with great records being overlooked by the broader investing public.  Our roots are those of a deep research and due diligence boutique.  The skillset and experience our team has developed allows us to bring potential value add alternative strategies to the marketplace.  We are not interested in constructing mass produced products where the goal is simply to gather assets.  The Balter Discretionary Global Macro Fund is our next step in offering compelling Alternative Mutual Funds (AMF's) which allow investors the ability to access hedge fund strategies in a format that seeks to help solves tax, transparency and liquidity issues for the investment community.  We strive to bring high quality hedge fund offerings to the mutual fund market."
About Balter Liquid Alternatives
Balter Liquid Alternatives (BLA) is a subsidiary of Balter Capital Management, a boutique firm focused on hedge fund research and investing. BLA was formed to create and manage daily liquidity alternative mutual funds. Balter Capital Management oversees approximately $1.3 Billion in hedge fund and alternative mutual fund assets. BLA constructs liquid investment products utilizing existing hedge fund managers.  For more information, please visit our website at www.balterliquidalts.com. 
Balter Long/Short Equity Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus may be obtained by clicking here or a free hard copy is available by calling 1-855-854-7258. Read it carefully before investing.
Balter Discretionary Global Macro Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus may be obtained by clicking here or a free hard copy is available by calling 1-844-322-8112. Read it carefully before investing.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The Fund is non-diversified and may hold a significant percentage of its assets in the securities of fewer companies, and therefore events affecting those companies have a greater impact on the Fund than on a diversified fund. The Fund may use derivatives which may not perform as anticipated by the Sub-Advisers, may not be able to be closed out at a favorable time or price, or may increase the Fund's volatility. Increases and decreases in the value of the Fund's portfolio may be magnified when the Fund uses leverage. The fund may make short sales of securities, which involves the risk that losses may exceed the original amount invested. When the Fund invests in ETF's or mutual fund's, it will bear additional expenses based on its pro rata share of the ETF's or mutual fund's operating expenses, including the potential duplication of management fees. The Fund also will incur brokerage costs when it purchases ETFs. The value of the Fund's investments in REITs may change in response to changes in the real estate market such as declines in the value of real estate, lack of available capital or financing opportunities, and increases in property taxes or operating costs.
The Balter Long/Short Equity Fund is Distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC and Balter Liquid Alternatives, LLC is the Investment Adviser.
The Balter Discretionary Global Macro Fund is distributed by Northern Lights Distributors, LLC, Member FINRA/SIPC. Balter Liquid Alternatives, LLC is not affiliated with Northern Lights Distributors, LLC.

About Us

Non-Traditional
Investment Specialists

Since inception in 2006, we have researched and analyzed non-traditional investments that include liquid alternatives, hedge funds, and private equity.

Identifying unique opportunities in structurally inefficient parts of the market across the alternatives landscape, regardless of asset class, strategy, geography, or investment structure.
Discovering non-traditional ways of adding value to existing asset allocation models as we believe that a one-size-fits-all structure does not work today.

We leverage our extensive knowledge of the marketplace, experience in various economic cycles, access to quality undiscovered managers and expertise in evaluating managers and investment opportunities to provide family offices, high net worth individuals, and institutions with thoughtful and dynamic customized solutions to achieve their investment goals.



How We View
the Alternative Investment Landscape.

Liquid Alternatives





      Our views on the alternative investment landscape are based on liquidity, transparency, and complexity. We examine these factors before making the most appropriate investment choices for our clients.    



Firm
Philosophy.
We are focused purely on hedge fund research and investing, with both pooled and uniquely tailored offerings. Our dedicated focus on hedge funds and liquid alternatives provides us with the highest level of insight and differentiation by applying our rigorous approach to sourcing, analyzing, monitoring and interacting with both investment and operations personnel at a given firm. We utilize both established funds as well as continuously sourcing "non-brand name" managers that have not yet been identified by the broader investment community. BCM’s clients all share the desire for a differentiated approach to hedge fund investing.
We utilize both established funds as well as continuously sourcing “non-brand name” managers that have not yet been identified by the broader investment community.


We stand by the following investment and management philosophies.
We remain committed to providing the highest standard of work,  service and understanding of client needs.


Right Sized Funds
Assets under management of any given fund and strategy is highly relevant to the selection process. While BCM does not maintain strict parameters on fund size, we favor funds that manage an appropriate amount of capital for their strategy so that they can invest in size or time-restrictive opportunities where larger funds would find their capital sizing precludes them from investing. Research has repeatedly shown that managers can generate better risk adjusted returns with a smaller capital base.




Operational Integrity
When assessing a fund or firm, operational integrity will always supersede performance. We meticulously analyze the operations and organizational structure for all hedge funds we invest with prior to committing capital. We do not utilize a “check the box” approach to operational due diligence, as we believe that for each given fund’s strategy and asset size, there are operational best practices that must be followed to mitigate business risk for a hedge fund investment. BCM also employs proprietary measures designed to identify potential operational failures that are often overlooked and are the result of our years of industry experience.




Challenge The Status Quo
Many industry participants have taken a passive approach to hedge fund investing. BCM believes that hedge funds require an active approach to identify the right manager over time. Extensive and on-going diligence on both existing and potential hedge fund investments allows us to maximize potential returns for our client base. We do not accept the status quo for industry fees, liquidity terms, or transparency. We've learned from experience that there is a negative correlation with a fund's assets under management and its returns. By challenging the industry on these and other metrics, we successfully add value for our clients.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 866.909.WISE (9473), or visit wisdomtree.com to view or download a prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing.

                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in derivatives, including as a substitute to gain short exposure to equity securities. Derivative investments can be volatile, and these investments may be less liquid than other securities, and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions. Derivatives used by the Fund to offset its exposure to market volatility may not perform as intended. The Fund may engage in “short sale” transactions and will lose value if the security or instrument that is the subject of a short sale increases in value. A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may increase the Fund’s vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. The composition of the respective Index underlying each Fund is heavily dependent on quantitative models and data from one or more third parties and the Index may not perform as intended. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit and the Fund does not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

        Regardless of whether you believe markets are efficient or return premiums exist, in any given year smart beta indexes that focus on capturing return premiums or “factors” are either going to out- or underperform market cap-weighted indexes. Over long periods, we feel that focusing on fundamentals and rebalancing back to those fundamentals at periodic intervals can add value over complete market cycles, partly by tilting toward known return premiums. In 2015, value and size (i.e., small caps) underperformed, but momentum, quality and low volatility outperformed.1   
Now the question is what factors will perform best in 2016 and whether the answer changes depending on the direction of the market. WisdomTree recently created the WisdomTree Dynamic Long/Short U.S. Equity Index (WTDLS), designed to generate alpha at the core with a multi-factor stock selection model along with the ability to hedge market risk dynamically. 
Key Features to WisdomTree Approach 
WisdomTree has been a pioneer in fundamental indexing for almost a decade, typically focusing on signal factors such as value, quality and size; but now we are pleased to introduce this new multi-factor approach. The WisdomTree Dynamic Long U.S. Equity Index (WTDL) is the long component of WTDLS and comprises approximately 100 stocks with the highest combined fundamentals, which are low volatility weighted and rebalanced quarterly. 
•	Fundamental Selection: Stocks are graded on a combination of growth, quality and value factors, and the most attractive stocks in each sector are selected for inclusion. It is important to note that each sector has its own unique factor scoring system, because we believe a different set of fundamentals may potentially work better in one sector as opposed to another. By combining quality and value factors, which we believe complement each other, we hope to smooth the return variance in the short term, while still tapping into the long-term return premiums. 
 
•	Low-Volatility Weighting: In each sector, the Index assigns higher weights to stocks that exhibit lower volatility characteristics, as measured by the stocks’ standard deviation and beta to the market. We know that low volatility weighting has historically worked as a single factor, so we believe applying it to a multi-factor selection model will also add value.  
 
•	Sector-Neutral Capping: The Index targets a sector-neutral allocation when compared to the largest 500 U.S. stocks by market capitalization. We believe this keeps the Index properly diversified and eliminates the potential for the fundamental selection or low-volatility weighting to significantly over- or under-weight certain sectors. We are confident about the stock selection and weighting process, so we wanted to rely on that to drive the relative return differentials instead of taking sector bets against a cap-weighted index.
To get a sense of the outcome from the selection and weighting process, we compared WTDL against popular market cap-weighted style and factor indexes. 
 
Index Valuations

For definitions of terms and indexes in the chart, visit our glossary. 
 
•	Attractive across Multiple Valuation Measures: We find it impressive, but not surprising, that WTDL scored high on multiple valuation measures. As of 12/31/2015, WTDL had the highest dividend yield; it also showed similar price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios as the S&P 500 Value Index, both indicators highlighting its tilt toward value. WTDL had the second-highest quality metrics, defined by return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), a very close second only to the MSCI USA Quality Index, which focuses more directly on that factor. Lastly, WTDL had higher profit margins than the S&P 500 Index and very similar growth expectations. 
 
Dynamic Hedging Indicator
The above table highlights how WTDL had diversified exposure across multiple factors—but what if markets are choppy? For one thing, the low-volatility weighting methodology could help smooth the returns and lower market drawdowns, but a primary driver will be the dynamic hedging indicator.  
The dynamic hedging indicator uses growth and quality indicators such as profit margins and popular valuation measures to determine the hedge ratio or short percentage. So when the fundamentals, or profits, of the universe are deteriorating, the dynamic indicator would look to hedge the portfolio or increase the short percentage. Similarly, as valuations become more stretched, adding risk to the portfolio, the indicator would look to hedge as well. 
While our hedging indicator will certainly not get every market downdraft timed perfectly, it did start getting more bearishly positioned toward the end of 2015 and signaled to be 100% hedge for January 2016, making the net equity exposure for WTDLS 0% (or market neutral). We believe the factor diversity and dynamic equity exposure this index provides deserve a second look, given the recent market volatility and uncertainty for 2016.
