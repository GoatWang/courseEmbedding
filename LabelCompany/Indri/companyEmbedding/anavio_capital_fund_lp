Anavio






















































 


















 





Who we are
Anavio Capital Partners LLP (“Anavio”) is a London based asset management company that employs an event-driven strategy with a capital structure approach.
Anavio aims to deliver superior uncorrelated risk-adjusted returns by opportunistically allocating capital to Special Situations, Arbitrage and Capital Markets strategies. We fully exploit the capital structure (including equity derivatives) to create asymmetric returns on idiosyncratic situations that offer multiple entry points for value creation.
Anavio has been established by Daniel Horsley, Emiliano Leggieri and Dario Sacchetti.
The firm started managing money in September 2015.
 

The Anavio name
Anavio was one of the earlier forts built in Britannia by the Romans in A.D. 73 during the governorship of Agricola.  Anavio stood at the conjunction of three main Roman roads and it became part of a line of forts in the region, including one at Templeborough, east of Sheffield, and an earlier fort at Chesterfield dating back to Nero.
The name translates as “on the river”. The fort was built in a commanding position to take advantage of the Rivers Bradwell, now just a stream, and Noe.
For a hundred years the fort was on the northernmost edge of the Roman Empire before expansion moved that line to Northumberland and then into the lowlands of Scotland.
