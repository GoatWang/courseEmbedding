We have been fighting and winning for the people of Georgia for more than twenty years. Please watch this introductory video to learn more about our practice. What Happens When You Call Our Firm? Atlanta Personal Injury LawyerWelcome to John Foy & Associates. As seen on television, John Foy is known as the "Strong Arm", a personal injury attorney who has been representing Atlanta victims and their families for more than 20 years. This may be the first time you've considered calling an injury attorney. You may be experiencing pain and discomfort and are probably faced with unexpected medical bills, time off of work and don't know what to do.Step 1 - Contact An Experienced Atlanta Personal Injury Law FirmIt's imperative to your physical and financial well-being to consult an attorney, no matter what, even when dealing with your own insurance company. Our founder, John M. Foy, always says, "Call an attorney first, call an attorney right away. We can't undo what has been done."Step 2 - Do Not Settle With the Insurance Company Without Speaking to An Atlanta Injury Attorney First.We understand that the insurance companies are going to offer you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to settle the claim and get you to surrender your rights. We also understand that that money can sure come in handy right now to cover medical bills, rent, and other living expenses. However, you, as an unrepresented individual, are extremely vulnerable to settling quickly and for not enough money. We know you're honest and expect the best from everyone. "But all I told them was the truth," is something we hear all the time. Of course we want you to tell the truth, but we want to protect and represent you first. Any insurance company's first obligation is to itself, not you. Even the smartest, most educated person is no match for the legions of attorneys dedicated to protecting the company's interest.Remember that insurance companies are very large and very sophisticated. They all share data and they have hundreds of attorneys in different departments. "They will tell you anything and everything to settle quickly," Foy says.   “No one should ever give a recorded statement to an insurance company, even their own insurance company, without consulting an attorney first.”   Listen to What Our Customers Have To Say  "My legs and my back were hurt, and my medical bills were through the roof. I knew that I needed the upper hand so I called The Strong Arm, John Foy & Associates." "John was there for everything. Anything that we needed, all we had to do was pick up the phone and call." "The settlement was awesome. I couldn't have asked for anything better."     Nearly $1 Billion in Settlements and Verdicts   $75,000   While traveling North on GA 92, our client Q.E. was struck in the rear while slowing for traffic.  Our client suffered back injuries.   $100,000   While traveling South on GA 61 South of Rock Creek Drive a truck exited the Murray County Landfill turning into the path of our client E.G. upon impact the truck spun striking our clients vehicle sending her off the left side of the roadway where she struck a guardrail with her front-end coming to an uncontrolled rest.  Our client was transported by ambulance with multiple injuries where immediate surgery was necessary.   $100,000   While traveling on US Highway 80 at Ladonia Drive our client W.C. was struck by a vehicle failing to yield the right of way.  Our client was transported by CARE Ambulance to Columbus Medical Center with severe injuries.   $100,000   Our client R.S. was a passenger in a vehicle traveling West Bound on Akers Mill Road at Powers Ferry Road when a Dodge Dakota turned left in front of the vehicle causing a collision.  Our client was transported by Metro Ambulance to Southern Regional with back injuries.   $105,000   Our client S.W. was a passenger in the rear seat of a vehicle that was traveling Northwest on North Druid Hills Road entering the intersection at LaVista Road.

Pay Us Nothing Unless We Win Your Case!It's in the insurance company's interest to make a quick settlement, but once you take their money it's over forever.You probably don't know, for example, that under Georgia state law no one has the right to know if you have insurance or not. Signing papers to allow an insurance company to look at your medical records gives them unlimited access to any of your medical accounts-an event that happened 30 years may suddenly be relevant. "We don't want our clients dealing with them at all," says Foy.Get help from a Georgia personal injury lawyer by calling 404-400-4000.How do I know if I have a personal injury case in Atlanta, GA?"Call someone who does this for a living, who does this every day," says founder Foy. "Call the specialist, call the expert."We have a team of dedicated professionals who are at your service-associate attorneys, investigators, legal assistants are all trained to strategically fight the big insurance companies on your behalf and get you the maximum settlement allowed by law. We'll interview you, gather police and accident reports, take photos, and interview witnesses. When we take a case on, we're very thorough in gathering the facts.Our first goal is to get you back to the best possible health. In fact, we don't even want to put a price tag on a case until you've recovered physically enough to get back to your life. The legal term is Maximum Medical Improvement. Then, and only then are we ready to put a price tag on the case.Here are some of the more common areas of Personal Injury:Auto AccidentsTrucking AccidentsSlip and fallsAssaults at an apartment complex or public buildingNursing home abuseSocial security disabilityProduct liabilityRecalled autos or auto partsMisfilled prescription or harmful prescribed drugIn short, a Tort is when someone is hurt due to somebody else's negligence or fault.Our lawyers are sure to have many years of experience in the type of harm that you received. We have helped many personal injury victims receive millions of dollars.If you already have an attorney but are not happy with his or her services, it's okay to change representation, even mid-case. We'll walk you through the process.How much time do I have to file an injury case in Atlanta, GA?The time limit, Statute of limitations, to legally file a claim varies greatly. That's why the sooner you call a lawyer, the better. In general, you have two years to file a claim in Georgia for a personal injury, but government entities, Indian reservations, cruise ships all have their own laws-the period could be very, very short, in some cases just weeks.How much money is this going to cost me?Hiring a personal injury attorney will not cost you anything up front. We take our fee as a percentage of your settlement. That's zero charge up front and zero charge if we should not make a recovery. You have no risk. Our goal in all our cases is to get our client as much money as we can as quickly as we can. The first and most important part, however, is getting you healthy and back to your life as much as possible. Then we can put a value on your case.Our consultation is absolutely cost-free (no matter how many times you need our advice), and our lawyer's service costs nothing until your case is officially won. We don't take cases we don't think we can win.What makes John Foy & Associates Different From The Other Personal Injury Lawyers In Atlanta?"Once we get a case we're partners," says Foy. "Because we're a big firm, I don't need to take the quick settlement. I can afford to do that."We're larger than most firms so we don't have the financial pressures to settle a case right away. If the trial needs 10 expert witnesses, we have the cash flow to support that. We've been in business for more than 20 years and we're successful at what we do. We have long-term relationships with health-care providers and professionals. We can counsel you towards the best medical care. And because we have a comfortable inventory of cases, no one file is going to impact us so much that we'd push you to settle. We can afford to go the distance and maximize your case.Our initial interviews usually involve these questions:What is the extent of your injuries?Are the damages permanent?Is there scarring?Do you need time away from work?How much are the medical bills?Do you need future treatment?Were you on the job when it happened?Will you need a vehicle?We address property damage and your health first. You need to get back to work; you need to go to the doctor. We get you medical care if you don't have insurance. Our goal is to get you back to optimal health before we even put a price tag on the case. Your responsibility is to follow your doctor's instructions and get the prescribed help necessary.What if I need the money now?We discourage our clients from taking out "pre-suit" loans. These loans are different from regular loans and are not regulated in the same way-if there is no settlement the loan does not have to be repaid. The companies can charge more interest than allowed by traditional venues. We'll work with you to make sure no one will take advantage of you during this difficult time.I don't want to go to courtNobody wants to go to court. Most cases are settled well before anyone ends up in front of a judge. And often we go to mediation, which is faster and a more temperate environment than a jury trial. But if you must go to court, we will be with you every step of the way, standing by you during depositions and trial. Our firm is proud to say we have been helping victims in Georgia with their recovery for over 20 years - and counting.Speak To A Personal Injury Lawyer In Atlanta TodayWe're here, ready to listen and assist.
