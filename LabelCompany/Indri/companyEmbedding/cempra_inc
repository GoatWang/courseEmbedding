	Overview

	Antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens have been a rising threat to human health for several years. Effectiveness of many antibacterial agents has declined worldwide limiting physicians' options to treat serious infections. Antibiotic drug resistance has a significant impact on morbidity and mortality and contributes heavily to healthcare system costs worldwide. The World Health Organization has stated that antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest healthcare challenges for the future.

	Cempra is focused on developing differentiated antibiotics to confront the rising threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Two products are in clinical development. Solithromycin is a novel, orally- and intravenously-active, broad-spectrum fluoroketolide. It recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with moderate to moderately-severe coummunity acquired bacterial pneumonia and met both primary and secondary objectives. A Phase 3 trial for the intravenous formulation is ongoing. A Phase 3 trial for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea infection is currently underway. TAKSTA™ (CEM-102, sodium fusidate) is an innovative dosing regimen of a product with a long history of safety and efficacy outside the U.S. against gram-positive organisms including MRSA. We have completed a Phase 2 trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with prosthetic joint infections.

	Solithromycin

	Solithromycin is a next-generation oral and intravenous fluoroketolide now in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of moderate to moderately-severe community acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and urethritis. A Phase 3 clinical trial of solithromycin oral capsules met its primary and secondary objectives in the treatment of CABP.

Macrolides & Infectious Disease

	Macrolides are antimicrobial drugs that are active against aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and are prescribed for the treatment of respiratory tract and soft tissue infections.

	Macrolides belong to the polyketide class of natural products. The macrolide ring - a large lactone ring to which one or more deoxy sugars, usually cladinose and desosamine, are attached - is responsible for the antimicrobial properties of this class. By reversibly binding to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, these drugs block protein synthesis, preventing bacterial growth and reproduction. This action is primarily bacteriostatic, however at higher concentrations, macrolides can be bactericidal. Some of the most commonly prescribed macrolides include erythromycin, azithromycin (Zithromax®) and clarithromycin (Biaxin®).

	Ketolides belong to the macrolide class that is used to treat respiratory tract infections. These drugs are effective against macrolide-resistant bacteria because of their ability to bind to two sites on the bacterial ribosome. Examples include telithromycin (Ketek®) and cethromycin.

	The spectrum of activity of macrolides includes streptococci as well as atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma and Legionella and intracellular bacteria such as Chlamydia.

	Acquired bacterial resistance to macrolides occurs primarily through post-transcriptional methylation of the 23S bacterial ribosomal RNA. This results in cross-resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins. Although rare, acquired resistance can also result from the production of drug-inactivating enzymes such as esterases or kinases, as well as the production of active ATP-dependent efflux proteins that transport macrolides out of the cell. As more than 45% of pneumococci are resistant to currently available antibiotics, a new macrolide is greatly needed. To address this need Cempra Pharmaceuticals is developing solithromycin.
	 

Profile of Solithromycin

	Solithromycin is a highly potent next-generation macrolide, the first fluoroketolide, which has potent activity against most macrolide-resistant strains. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown potent activity against S. pneumoniae as well as an extended spectrum of activity against CA-MRSA, enterococci, Mycobacterium avium and in animal models of malaria. It is also active against atypical bacteria, such as Legionella, Chlamydophila, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma and against gonococci and other organisms that cause genitourinary tract infections. It is 8-16 times more potent than azithromycin and is active against azithromycin-resistant strains. Its activity against resistant strains is driven by its ability to bind to three sites on the bacterial ribosome, compared to one or two for current macrolides. The binding to three ribosomal sites is expected to limit resistance development.

	Solithromycin does not contain a pyridine in the side chain of the molecule (as does telithromycin or Ketek®) that appears to interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and could be associated with serious adverse events such as visual disturbances and exacerbations of myasthenia gravis that have been observed with telithromycin.

	Phase 1 dose-escalation studies in healthy subjects showed that solithromycin was safe and well tolerated, and PK/PD results support once-daily administration of oral solithromycin. Phase 2 data demonstrated that oral solithromycin ws well tolerated with efficacy comparable with levofloxacin in patients with CABP. Phase 3 data from Solitaire-Oral showed positive topline results with the study meeting its primary and secondary objectives. A Phase 3 oral-to-intravenous clinical trial in patients with CABP is ongoing.

	We also conducted a small Phase II clinical trial of oral solithromycin in patients with uncomplicated gonococcal infections. In this clinical trial, a single dose of oral solithromycin cleared infection in all 22 evaluable patients. A Phase 3 clinical trial is currently underway.

	TAKSTATM (CEM-102)

	Fusidic acid (TAKSTATM, CEM-102) is an antibiotic with a long history of safety and efficacy outside the United States. Cempra has exclusive rights to the supply of the compound for the U.S. market. Fusidic acid is orally active against gram-positive bacteria, including all S. aureus strains such as HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA. A novel dosing regimen has been successfully evaluated in a Phase 2 trial in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (aBSSSI). Cempra is conducting a Phase 2 trial of TAKSTA for patients with prosthetic joint infections.


Profile of TAKSTA (CEM-102)
	Prosthetic joint infections (PJI) occur in about 1% of hip replacements and 2% of knee replacements, translating to an incidence rate of about 10,000 per year in the U.S. at current hip and knee arthroplasty rates.  There are few good options to treat these serious staphylococcal, often MRSA infections, which require long-term antibiotic treatment.  Current therapy in the U.S. is with intravenous antibiotics such as vancomycin.  An oral drug that can be safely administered for a long period of time could improve care and quality of life for these patients.

	TAKSTA has shown potent activity against a large number of S. aureus strains, including CA-MRSA, HA-MRSA and linezolid-resistant strains, isolated in the U.S over a 10 year period. Its broad S. aureus coverage makes it useful for a broad range of clinical applications. Because of its safety and tolerability profile, TAKSTA could be ideal for patients suffering from staphylococcal infections that require long-term therapy such as patients with PJIs.

	Cempra has developed a unique oral loading dose regimen to optimize key pathogen coverage and minimize drug resistance development. This regimen is incorporated in our Phase 2 trial to treat PJIs with TAKSTA in combination with rifampin, which is commonly used with injectible antibiotics such as vancomycin to treat PJIs.

	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE





	CEMPRA REPORTS FIRST QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND PROVIDES CORPORATE UPDATE




	Management to host webcast and conference call today at 8:45 a.m. ET




	CHAPEL HILL, N.C.  April 28, 2017

	 Cempra, Inc. (Nasdaq: CEMP), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing
	antibiotics to meet critical medical needs in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and provided an update on recent corporate developments. The company will host a
	webcast and conference call today at 8:45 a.m. ET.


	With our sizable cash resources and the significant cost reduction actions we took in the first
	quarter, along with advancing the regulatory process for solithromycin and fusidic acid and the robust process we have underway to evaluate potential strategic business opportunities, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver value to patients
	and shareholders, said David Zaccardelli, Pharm.D., acting chief executive officer of Cempra.



	First Quarter 2017 and Recent Corporate Highlights






	Fusidic Acid





	 




	 


	


	 


	In February 2017, Cempra announced positive topline results from a phase 3 study of oral fusidic acid in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Fusidic acid was well tolerated in the
	study and achieved the primary endpoint, demonstrating non-inferiority (NI) (10% NI margin) of oral fusidic acid compared to oral linezolid for early clinical response in the intent to treat patient population.




	 




	 


	


	 


	Based on the results of this study, Cempra plans to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second quarter to discuss the next steps required to bring fusidic acid to patients in the United States.











	Solithromycin





	 




	 


	


	 


	Following a meeting with the FDA in February 2017, Cempra has recently submitted a protocol to the FDA which proposes including fewer than 9,000 patients at the time the company responds to the complete response letter
	it received in December 2016.




	 




	 


	


	 


	The company plans to discuss the protocol with the FDA to determine if it could support an initial approval in patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP), while the company continues to accumulate a
	larger post-approval safety database. If the company and FDA agree on a protocol, Cempra plans to seek non-dilutive funding to support the execution of the study.




	 




	 


	


	 


	In March 2017, Cempra announced the company had withdrawn its marketing authorization application seeking European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of oral capsule and intravenous formulations of solithromycin for the
	treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. This action enabled the company to conserve considerable financial resources, and to align its strategy to provide additional data to both the EMA and FDA to support potential approval.







	Corporate Activities





	 




	 


	


	 


	In February 2017, the company initiated cost and personnel reductions, resulting in an approximately 67 percent reduction in the companys workforce and significant reductions in external spending related to
	commercial preparedness and non-essential activities. The principal objective of the reductions was to enable the company to conserve its financial resources as it evaluates the best path forward with its existing late stage clinical pipeline and
	potential business development opportunities.




	 




	 


	


	 


	As a result of the restructuring, the company expects research and corporate expenses to trend significantly downward beginning in the second quarter of this year and expects to reduce second half 2017 expenses by more
	than 70 percent compared to the second half of 2016. These operating expense assumptions do not contemplate the costs associated with a commercial launch of solithromycin or any additional clinical trials with any of the companys product
	candidates. Future discussions with regulatory authorities and agreement on further clinical development requirements may lead to additional expense and the company would expect to provide more granular expense guidance at that time.




	 




	 


	


	 


	In March 2017, the company announced it had retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC as financial advisor to the company and to lead a process to review strategic business options. The goal of this process is for
	Cempra to determine the best use of its significant cash resources and clinical programs to deliver value to patients and shareholders through internal and/or potential external opportunities.











	Financial Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017





	For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, Cempra reported a net loss of $22.9 million, or $0.44 per share. During the same period in 2016, Cempra reported a
	net loss of $29.4 million, or $0.61 per share.


	Research and development (R&D) expense in the first quarter of 2017 was $15.4 million, a decrease of
	34.5 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016. The reduced R&D expense was primarily due to decreased regulatory expenses in the first quarter of 2017, compared to higher new drug application related expenses in the first quarter of 2016,
	and decreases in commercial preparation activities, partially offset by an increase in BARDA related expenses. General and administrative expense was $8.8 million, an increase of 5.3 percent compared to the same quarter in 2016. Employee costs
	increased by $1.1 million as the result of an increased headcount compared to the same period last year, before the reduction in workforce, offset by a decrease in professional services of $0.7 million related to the delay of our planned commercial
	launch of solithromycin. In the first quarter of 2017, the company also recorded a one-time restructuring charge of $3.6 million for severance and other expenses related to the cost and personnel reductions activities the company initiated in
	February 2017.


	As of March 31, 2017, Cempra had cash and equivalents of $202.8 million and 52.4 million shares outstanding.



	Conference Call and Webcast



	Cempra management will host
	a webcast and conference call regarding this announcement at 8:45 a.m. ET today. The live call may be accessed by dialing 877-377-7553 for domestic callers and 253-237-1151 for international callers and using conference ID # 99531916. A live webcast

	About Cempra, Inc.



	Cempra, Inc. is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing differentiated anti-infectives for acute care and community settings to meet
	critical medical needs in the treatment of infectious diseases. Cempras two lead product candidates are currently in advanced clinical development. Solithromycin has been evaluated in two phase 3 clinical trials for community-acquired
	bacterial pneumonia (CABP). Cempra is currently seeking approval for CABP for both intravenous and oral capsule formulations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Solithromycin is licensed to strategic commercial partner Toyama Chemical Co.,
	Ltd., a subsidiary of FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation, for certain exclusive rights in Japan. Cempra is contracted with BARDA for the development of solithromycin for pediatric use and has commenced enrollment in a global Phase 2/3 trial to evaluate
	the safety and efficacy of solithromycin versus standard of care antibiotics in children and adolescents from two months to






	17 years of age. Solithromycin is also in development for uncomplicated urogenital urethritis caused by

	Neisseria gonorrhoeae

	or chlamydia. Fusidic acid is Cempras second product
	candidate, which has completed a phase 3 trial comparing fusidic acid to linezolid in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Cempra also has an ongoing exploratory study of fusidic acid for chronic oral treatment
	of refractory infections in bones and joints. Both products seek to address the need for new treatments targeting drug-resistant bacterial infections in the hospital and in the community. Cempra is also studying solithromycin for ophthalmic
	conditions and has synthesized novel macrolides for non-antibiotic uses such as the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, endocrine diseases and gastric motility disorders. Cempra was founded in 2006 and is headquartered in Chapel Hill, N.C.

	This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding future
	events. These statements are just predictions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual events or results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties include, among others: our ability to address the issues
	identified by the FDA in the complete response letter relating to our new drug applications for solithromycin for community acquired bacterial pneumonia; our ability to realize the cost savings of our recently initiated cost and personnel
	reductions; our ability to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of solithromycin as a treatment for community acquired bacterial pneumonia; our ability to identify and enter into strategic business transactions; our ability to meaningfully
	reduce our research and corporate expenses; the impact of the recent changes in senior management and our ability to retain and hire necessary employees and to staff our operations appropriately; our anticipated capital expenditures and our
	estimates regarding our capital requirements, including the costs of addressing the complete response letter; our dependence on the success of solithromycin and fusidic acid; our and our strategic commercial partners ability to obtain FDA and
	foreign regulatory approval of our product candidates; the costs, sources of funds, enrollment, timing, regulatory review and results of our studies and clinical trials and those of our strategic commercial partners; results of our and our strategic
	commercial partners pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are not predictive of results from subsequent clinical trials for any possible therapy; our need to obtain additional funding and our ability to obtain future funding on acceptable
	terms; the unpredictability of the size of the markets for, and market acceptance of, any of our products, including solithromycin and fusidic acid; the possible impairment of, or inability to obtain, intellectual property rights and the costs of
	obtaining such rights from third parties; our ability to compete in our industry; innovation by our competitors; and our ability to stay abreast of and comply with new or modified laws and regulations that currently apply or become applicable to our
	business. The reader is referred to the documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
