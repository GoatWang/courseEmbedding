 Following a recent trip to Beijing, Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein discusses why he believes the mood in China today is one of confidence, stability and “a sense of place in the world.” Despite China’s challenges, Blankfein highlights a relatively strong growth rate and a strong commitment to infrastructure as contributing factors to China’s sense of optimism.

I’d say there’s a lot of confidence in China. If you look around the world now, there’s a lot of instability and a lot of kind of negative politics around the world. China is almost an island of stability.

 Following a recent trip to Beijing, Goldman Sachs Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein discusses why he believes the mood in China today is one of confidence, stability and “a sense of place in the world.” Despite China’s challenges, Blankfein highlights a relatively strong growth rate and a strong commitment to infrastructure as contributing factors to China’s sense of optimism.

I’d say there’s a lot of confidence in China. If you look around the world now, there’s a lot of instability and a lot of kind of negative politics around the world. China is almost an island of stability.
