Mark W. Kehaya Partner 
mark@meriturn.com 



 

Mark W. Kehaya, Partner
mark@meriturn.com
Mr. Kehaya has over 20 years of experience in general management and finance positions. Mr. Kehaya formed Meriturn Partners in 2001, and provides leadership in all aspects of the Meriturn Fund with a particular focus in transaction structuring, operational turnarounds, and portfolio management. He is a member of the Board of Johnston Textiles and former Chairman at Dunn Paper.
Prior to Meriturn, he was President and CEO of Eturn Communications, Inc. (now Xpherix). At Eturn, Mr. Kehaya was brought in by the Board of Directors to develop and implement a turnaround plan. The plan included refocusing the business from an Internet based company to a communications software provider, reducing the cash burn, creating a new software platform, and refocusing the business development efforts. When the plan was secure he turned the business over to a seasoned industry professional. 
Prior to joining Eturn, Mr. Kehaya worked for Standard Commercial Corporation (NYSE: STW) in a variety of different roles. As CEO of CRES Neva and CRES Trading from 1998-2000, Mr. Kehaya developed, built, and operated a processing plant in St. Petersburg, Russia. As CFO of the tobacco division, Mr. Kehaya was a senior member of the management team that turned around this division from record losses to record profits in four years. In this role, Mr. Kehaya participated in the $360 million restructuring of the division's balance sheet, implemented new risk management procedures, cut expenses, improved asset turns and financial controls, and negotiated certain key strategic acquisitions. As Director of Strategic Planning for the holding company, Mr. Kehaya developed the corporation's first strategic plan and oversaw the implementation of the global budgeting system. 
Prior to joining STW, Mr. Kehaya worked for Fieldstone Private Capital Group and Bankers Trust (now Deutsche Bank) in their project finance and restructuring groups. 

Currently, Mr. Kehaya is a member of the Board of Directors of Standard Commercial Corporation (NYSE: STW). Mr. Kehaya earned an MA degree in Economics from Cambridge University in England and attended the Fuqua School at Duke University.

MORRISVILLE, N.C., Dec. 15, 2010 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Alliance One International, Inc. (NYSE:   AOI) announced today that it is implementing several strategic initiatives to better position the Company to serve its customers consistent with the evolving market environment.   The Company is realigning its organization and strengthening its management team to address the changing business models of its customer base and reallocating resources to increase efficiency and better support its core business functions. 
To provide leadership for the new initiatives, the Board of Directors of Alliance One has named Mark W. Kehaya Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer, and has promoted J. Pieter Sikkel to President.  The Company's Chief Financial Officer Robert A. Sheets has received the additional title of Chief Administrative Officer.  Robert E. "Pete" Harrison has stepped down as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alliance One and its affiliates, effective immediately.
William S. Sheridan, Lead Director of the Alliance One Board of Directors, said: "On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank Pete for his numerous contributions over the past 15 years.  As we move forward with the next phase of building Alliance One's core tobacco business and enhancing its operational and financial performance, Pete and the Board agreed that the time is right to make this leadership change.  We wish him success in his future endeavors.
"We are confident that Mark Kehaya, who has been a member of the Board of Alliance One and a predecessor company since 2000, will take the steps necessary to ensure that our management team performs for our customers and shareholders while the Company evolves and grows.  He understands the Company's challenges as well as its opportunities.  He brings significant operational expertise and skills to drive the change that is needed and to continue building shareholder value.  We are delighted to promote Pieter, who is a talented leader with extensive global and customer experience, to President," Sheridan concluded.
Mark Kehaya said, "I am excited to have the opportunity to lead this organization.  I look forward to working with a talented group of people here to ensure our company is well-positioned to address significant industry challenges and changes.  Among our objectives will be a sharp focus on being the most effective supplier of tobacco leaf products in terms of value, quality, service and support.  My first priorities will be managing our costs to improve our competitiveness and financial performance while we make the operational changes needed to position our company for ongoing success."
Mr. Kehaya has considerable experience in the tobacco industry.  Prior to founding Meriturn Partners, from 1993-2000 he held senior leadership roles at Standard Commercial Corporation, a predecessor company of Alliance One.  As CEO of CRES Neva and CRES Trading, Mr. Kehaya developed, built and operated a processing plant in St. Petersburg, Russia.  As CFO of the tobacco division of Standard Commercial, Mr. Kehaya was part of the team that led a $360 million restructuring of the division's balance sheet, implemented new risk management procedures, cut expenses, improved asset turns and financial controls, and negotiated certain key strategic acquisitions, resulting in record profits. As Director of Strategic Planning for the holding company, Mr. Kehaya developed its first strategic plan and oversaw the implementation of the global budgeting system.  Mr. Kehaya holds an MA degree from Cambridge University in England.
Mr. Sikkel has served as Executive Vice President – Business Strategy and Relationship Management since 2007.  Previously, he served as Regional Director of Asia from 2005-2007, Senior Vice President of Asia for Standard Commercial Corporation from 2004-2005, and Regional Manager of Asia from 1999-2004.  He has been with the Company and its predecessors for 27 years.
