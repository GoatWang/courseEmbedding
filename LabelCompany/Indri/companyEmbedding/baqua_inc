Just a Few Minutes a Week
The BAQUA Spa® Water Care System is simple to use.  Even so, there are certain basic things you should do regularly to avoid problems with your spa. These include housekeeping, checking water balance and sanitization.  For important information on these key factors view the BAQUA Spa® Spa Care and Water Testing Guide.  You can also contact us by e-mail or call us toll-free at 1-877-929-7945 8am to 10pm EST, 7 days a week for spa care assistance.

If you do need additional help maintaining your spa, however, please contact your Authorized BAQUA Spa® Dealer.  They are experienced professionals who are trained to help you get the most out of your spa, and the BAQUA Spa® Water Care System.
Download the BAQUA Spa® Spa Care and Water Testing Guide (274 KB PDF)


I.  Housekeeping

Cover – clean your cover every other week, concentrating on the water side.
Shell – clean your spa shell at the waterline regularly with BAQUA Spa® Surface Cleaner and a Spa Cleaning Pad.
Filter – most spas have a cartridge filter.  Check your owner's manual for details on how to remove the filter for cleaning.  Clean your spa filter at least every 4-6 weeks with BAQUA Spa® Filter Cleaner* – follow the label directions.  Regular filter cleaning is an important step in your spa care routine and plays a key role in keeping your spa water clear all year long.

*A degreaser/TSP (tri sodium phosphate) should not be used for filter cleaning.
II.  Water Balance
No matter which sanitizing system you choose, keeping the water balanced is essential to your enjoyment of the spa.  Water is balanced when pH, total alkalinity and hardness are all within the proper range.  Problems arise when any of these factors are too high or low.  Unbalanced water can become corrosive or cause the formation of scale deposits.  Corrosive water also attacks the integrity of metal components; pitting, etching and staining them.  Scale formation causes cloudy water, surface staining or short filter cycling.  Any of these conditions can cause problems for the spa, and irritations, especially of the eyes and skin, for the people using it.




Summary of Recommended Ranges for Water Balance Factors






pH
7.2-7.8






Total Alkalinity
80-120ppm






Calcium Hardness
200-400ppm






Metals
None






Total dissolved solids
Not to exceed 2,000ppm






Water temperature
Not to exceed 104°F







III.  Water Testing
BAQUA Spa® 4-Way Test Strips are a quick and easy way to check your spa water’s BAQUA Spa® Sanitizer with Stain & Scale Control, Calcium Hardness, Total Alkalinity and pH levels.  Every four weeks, or when you refill your spa, your water should be tested by your
BAQUA Spa® dealer.  Take a water sample to your dealer in a clean, plastic container.
