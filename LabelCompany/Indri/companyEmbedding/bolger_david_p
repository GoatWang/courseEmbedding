Over the years, Dave has built broad and expert knowledge on the subject matter in the European markets, in particular the UK & Ireland. This expertise put him into the ideal position to move into client service (and eventually leading a team of 5+ staff), where Dave delivered an excellent job, translating complex issues to, and resolving queries and issues for clients and other counterparties, always having the client interests and needs in mind, while also managing the impact to the business, in this risk prone and deadline laced environment of global custody. 
Dave has been integral in contributing his experience to system enhancements, continuously improving the client experience. 
It has been a pleasure working with Dave. With his leadership and solid delivery, he would be an asset to any company; and I am more than happy to recommend him for any such position.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended DavidView David‚Äôs full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact David directlyView David‚Äôs Full ProfileNot the David you‚Äôre looking for?
