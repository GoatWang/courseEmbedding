Years ago the phrase “CYALUME .. IT’S NOT JUST BRIGHT .. IT’S BRILLIANT” was coined with reference to our light stick business but we have taken that same thought and applied it to our other businesses and products so we believe that it is just as applicable today as it was many years ago. We look forward to the opportunity to work with new clients on new thoughts and ideas to ensure that the phrase continues to shine brightly.

Cyalume Technologies Holdings, Inc. Announce a New Chemical Light Product in the Public & Commercial Safety Markets
WEST SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Oct. 23, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cyalume Technologies, Inc. (OTCBB:CYLU), the world leader in the chemical lighting industry, introduces a new 8" Flare Alternative, the Next Generation Flare(TM).

Developed as a safe, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional flares that are currently used by law enforcement, safety workers, and consumers, the 8" Ultra High-Intensity lightstick with reflective strip and attached wire stand is the new dependable instant light solution. Government agencies and commercial companies are moving away from incendiary flares because of pollution, fire danger, and liability. Traditional flares burn at extremely high temperatures causing severe burns, ruined uniforms/clothing, and equipment. They contain large amounts of hazardous materials such as sulfur and perchlorates. These hazards create risk for the user, innocent bystanders, and the environment. They are difficult to extinguish and the fumes are offensive and toxic.

Unlike traditional flares, the 8" Flare Alternative will not produce heat or flames. It provides 30 minutes of reliable high-intensity light visible up to one mile. Activation is easy with no batteries required. The 8" Flare Alternative meets DOT non-hazardous standards, eliminating hazardous shipping fees.

8" Flare Alternatives are ideal for use at accident scenes, vehicle breakdowns, as hazard markers, and to alert drivers of obstacles in the road. This ultra high-intensity lightstick can be used in wet or dry weather and provides the most visible light in low-light or dark situations. The new-patented formulation provides superior performance in cold and warm climates.

Designed to be practical with an "easy to use", "easy to maintain", and "easy to operate" approach, the new 8" Flare Alternative Ultra High-Intensity lightstick has proved useful for safety workers as the Next Generation Flare(TM). To learn more about the new 8"Flare Alternative, and how it will enhance your current operations, please email info@cyalume.com.

	PART I—FINANCIAL INFORMATION



	 



	The statements contained in this quarterly
	report on Form 10-Q, including under the section titled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
	and Results of Operations" and other sections of this quarterly report, include forward-looking statements within the meaning
	of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
	amended, including, without limitation, statements regarding our or our management's expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or
	strategies regarding the future. The words "believe," "may," "will," "estimate," "continue,"
	"anticipate," "intend," "expect," "plan" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking
	statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements
	contained in this quarterly report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential
	effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking
	statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause
	actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should
	one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary
	in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any
	forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under
	applicable securities laws. Unless the content otherwise requires, all references to "we", "us", the “Company"
	or “Cyalume" in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q refers to Cyalume Technologies Holdings, Inc.

	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
	Statements




	 









	1.






	ORGANIZATION






	 


	Cyalume Technologies Holdings,
	Inc. (the “Company”) was organized as a blank check company under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 19, 2005.
	At that time, the Company was named Vector Security Intersect Acquisition Corp. On December 19, 2008, the Company acquired Cyalume
	Technologies, Inc. (“CTI”) and changed the corporate name to the current name. CTI is a Delaware corporation formed
	on March 27, 1997 with headquarters located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

	BASIS
	OF PRESENTATION






	 


	The accompanying unaudited condensed
	consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
	GAAP”) for interim financial information. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial
	statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. The Company
	believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. All the adjustments which, in
	the opinion of management, are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the periods shown
	are of a normal recurring nature and have been reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Results
	from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for
	any other interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2017. The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 has been
	derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date. The information included in these unaudited interim condensed
	consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto
	in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 filed on March 28, 2017.


	 


	The preparation of financial
	statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
	reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. While the Company believes that such estimates are fair when considered
	in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole, the actual amount
	of such estimates, when known, may vary from these estimates.

	CREDIT
	LINE AND NOTES PAYABLE







	 




	Monroe Refinancing



	 


	On May 18, 2015, the Company
	entered into a credit agreement with Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC (the “Monroe Credit Agreement”), refinancing
	its existing senior and subordinated debt (see below). The Monroe Credit Agreement provides for a $25.0 million credit facility
	consisting of up to: (i) a $5.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Monroe Line of Credit”); (ii) an $18.0 million
	senior secured term loan (the “Term A Loan”) and (iii) a $2.0 million delayed draw term loan (the “Delayed Draw
	Loan”). The Delayed Draw Loan was used to satisfy a legal settlement agreement amount.


	 


	The Monroe Credit Agreement
	has a term of five years and bears interest at a rate of the one-month LIBOR plus 9%. The Term A Loan requires quarterly repayments
	of approximately $113,000 beginning on June 30, 2015 through March 31, 2016; quarterly repayments of approximately $225,000 beginning
	on June 30, 2016 through March 31, 2017; quarterly repayments of approximately $450,000 beginning on June 30, 2017 through March
	31, 2020; and a payment of approximately $11.3 million on the Term A Loan maturity date of May 18, 2020. Accrued interest shall
	be payable monthly in arrears on the last business day of each calendar month.


	 


	Pursuant to the terms of the
	Monroe Credit Agreement, the Company must maintain: (i) a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00; (ii) a senior debt to EBITDA
	ratio initially of 4.50 to 1.00, decreasing to 1.50 to 1.00 over the term of the loans; and (iii) a twelve month trailing EBITDA,
	measured quarterly, with the amounts ranging from $4,750,000, increasing up to $7.0 million over the term of the loans. The Company
	was in compliance with the financial covenants related to these loans as of March 31, 2017.

	Cyalume Technologies Holdings, Inc.




	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
	Statements



	 


	On August 3, 2015, the
	Company entered into a First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Monroe Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the
	First Amendment, the Monroe Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce the aggregate amount of the Delayed
	Draw Loan under the Monroe Credit Agreement, which loan commitment was for purposes of funding a final payment due under the
	a legal settlement agreement, from $2.0 million to $1.5 million. On August 3, 2015, the full amount of the Delayed Draw Loan
	was funded to the Company, $1.4 million of which was used to make a final legal settlement payment, and the remaining
	$100,000 of which was paid to Monroe as a deferred closing fee. The First Amendment also modified, for certain periods during
	the term of the Credit Agreement, (i) the maximum senior debt to EBITDA ratio that the Company is required to maintain and
	(ii) the applicable limits on the Company’s aggregate permitted capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of the
	Credit Agreement.


	 


	The Delayed Draw Loan, which
	was drawn on August 3, 2015, provides for quarterly amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter in an aggregate
	principal amount equal to 0.625% of the original principal amount of the Delayed Draw Loan, increasing to 1.25% on March 31, 2016,
	and increasing to 2.5% on March 31, 2017, with the balance payable on the maturity date of May 18, 2020.


	  


	In connection with the execution
	of the Monroe Credit Agreement, the Company issued 10 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock (the “Series D Convertible
	Preferred Stock”).  Each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted at any time at the option of
	the holder into a number of shares of common stock initially equal to 752,807.8 shares of common stock (see Note 7). The relative
	fair value of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock was approximately $2.8 million which was recorded as debt issuance costs
	of approximately $0.4 million and debt discount on the Company’s Term A Loan and Delayed Draw Loan of approximately $2.4
	million.


	 


	The proceeds from the Monroe
	Credit Agreement were allocated to the various instruments issued based on their relative fair value.



	 




	Line of Credit



	 


	The Monroe Line of
	Credit has a maximum borrowing capacity of $5.0 million, bears interest at a rate of the one-month LIBOR plus 9% and expires
	on May 18, 2020. The amount which may be borrowed under the Monroe Line of Credit is dependent mainly on accounts receivable
	and inventory balances. Under the terms of the Monroe Credit Agreement, the Company is able to borrow under the Monroe Line
	of Credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (i) $5.0 million and (ii) the sum of 85% of all eligible accounts
	receivable plus 60% of all eligible inventory. Interest is payable monthly and the Monroe Line of Credit’s interest
	rate at March 31, 2017 was 10%. This line of credit is subject to various restrictive covenants and collateral guarantees. At
	March 31, 2017, $1.0 million was outstanding on the Monroe Line of Credit and availability under the Monroe Line of Credit
	was approximately $4.0 million.


	 


	CTSAS has lines of credit, for
	borrowing against receivables, with a combined maximum borrowing capacity of €750,000 (or approximately $801,120 as of March
	31, 2017). There were no outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016. The lines’ interest rates are variable,
	based on the 3-month Euro Interbank Offered Rate. The lines are collateralized by primarily CTSAS accounts receivable. The lines
	have indefinite termination dates but can be renegotiated periodically.

	The Company is authorized to
	issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences
	as may be determined from time to time by our Board of Directors. 


	 


	On November 19, 2013, the Company

	A Investor”) for the purchase by the Investor of 123,077 units of securities of the Company for an aggregate purchase price
	of $4.0 million (or $32.50 per unit). Each security issued is composed of: 1) one share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

	the “Common Warrant”); and 3) one preferred stock warrant (the “Preferred Warrant”).

	Each share of Series A Preferred
	Stock may be converted at any time at the option of the holder into a number of shares of common stock initially equal to 50 shares
	of common stock, determined by dividing the Liquidation Value per share of Series A Preferred Stock by the applicable conversion
	price per share of Series A Preferred Stock. The initial conversion price was equal to $0.65, subject to customary adjustments,
	including for any accrued but unpaid dividends and pursuant to certain anti-dilution provisions. Pursuant to the Series A
	Certificate of Designation amended on July 30, 2014 (the “Amended Series A Certificate of Designation”), the conversion
	price per share of Series A Preferred Stock is now equal to $0.13664587. The Series A Preferred Stock is not subject to mandatory
	conversion at any time.


	 


	Upon voluntary or involuntary
	liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, each holder of Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to a liquidation preference
	of $32.50 per share, plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Certificate of
	Designation (the “Series A Liquidation Value”).


	 


	Dividends on the Series A Preferred
	Stock accrue (payable in cash or in kind), whether or not declared by the Board and whether or not funds are available for the
	payment of dividends, at a rate of 12% per annum on the sum of the liquidation preference plus all accrued and accumulated dividends
	and will be payable quarterly in arrears in a) cash or b) newly issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation
	preference equal to the amount of such accrued dividends (“PIK Dividends”) at the option of the Company. All accrued
	and accumulated dividends on the convertible preferred stock shall be paid prior to and in preference to any other class of securities
	of the Company.  


	 


	Each share of Series A Preferred
	Stock will be entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such share is convertible
	and shall be entitled to vote with holders of outstanding shares of common stock, voting together as a single class, with respect
	to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration.


	 


	The requisite holders of the
	Series A Preferred Stock will have the right to cause the Company to redeem, out of funds legally available, all but not less than
	all of the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, for a price per share equal to the Series A Liquidation Value of
	such shares, from and after the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Series A Purchase Agreement. Additionally, the Company
	will have the right to redeem all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock from and after the eighth anniversary of
	the closing date of the Series A Purchase Agreement at a redemption price equal to the Series A Liquidation Value. As a result
	of the redemption provisions, the Series A Preferred Stock has been classified outside of permanent equity.



	 




	Series B Convertible Preferred
	Stock




	 



	On July 30, 2014, the Company
	entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Series B and C Purchase Agreement”) with Cova Small Cap Holdings,
	LLC (“Cova”), Bayonet Capital Fund I, LLC (see Note 10), and another investor (each, an “Investor”) for
	the purchase by the Investors of an aggregate of 1,000 units of securities of the Company (the “Units”) for an aggregate
	purchase price of $2.0 million (or $2,000.00 per Unit), with each Unit comprising (1) one share of Series B Convertible Preferred
	Stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and (2) one share of Series C Preferred
	Stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). Approximately $1.3 million of the
	net proceeds from the sale of the Units was used to pay a contingent legal obligation.


	 


	The shares of Series B Preferred
	Stock have the rights and preferences set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, which
	was amended on May 15, 2015 (the “Amended Series B Certificate of Designation”). Pursuant to the Amended Series B Certificate
	of Designation, each share of Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”)
	and the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation,
	dissolution or winding up of the Company. Upon the Company’s liquidation, sale to or merger with another corporation or other
	“Change of Control” (as such term is defined in the Amended Series B Certificate of Designation), each share of Series
	B Preferred Stock would be entitled to a liquidation preference in an amount equal to the amount per share that would have been
	payable had all shares of Series B Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such event in accordance
	with the terms of the Amended Series B Certificate of Designation, excluding for purposes of such calculation the liquidation preference
	payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to convert at any time
	all or any portion of the shares of Series B

	of shares of Common Stock initially equal to 35,713.147 shares of Common Stock per share of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Conversion
	Number”). The Conversion Number is subject to customary adjustments, including for dividends, stock splits and other reorganizations
	affecting the Common Stock. In addition, the Conversion Number is subject to anti-dilution protections, subject to certain exceptions,
	if the Company issues or sells shares of Common Stock or other equity securities for no consideration or for consideration that
	is based on an equity valuation of the Company of less than $2.0 million in the aggregate (a “Trigger Issuance”). In
	the event of a Trigger Issuance, the Conversion Number shall be increased as of the close of business on the effective date of
	the Trigger Issuance to a number calculated as follows: (i) two-thirds of the Common Stock deemed Outstanding (as defined in the
	Amended Series A Certificate of Designation) immediately following such Trigger Issuance (excluding any Common Stock Deemed Outstanding
	as a result of the conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock) (ii) divided by 1,000. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock will
	automatically convert into shares of Common Stock on the tenth anniversary of its original issuance date, at the then-current Conversion
	Number. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock into
	which such share is convertible and will be entitled to vote with holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, voting together
	as a single class, with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company for their action or consideration.

	Series C Preferred Stock



	 


	The shares of Series C Preferred
	Stock have the rights and preferences set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series C Preferred Stock, which was amended
	on May 15, 2015 (the “Amended Series C Certificate of Designation”). Pursuant to the Amended Series C Certificate of
	Designation, each share of Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Common Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series
	B Preferred Stock and the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon liquidation,
	dissolution or winding up of the Company. Upon the Company’s liquidation, sale to or merger with another corporation or other
	“Change of Control” (as such term is defined in the Amended Series C Certificate of Designation), each share of Series
	C Preferred Stock would be entitled to a liquidation preference equal to the sum of: (1) $3,000 per share (the “Base Liquidation
	Value”) and the (2) the amount, if any, by which the Base Value exceeds 150% of the purchase price (the “Excess Liquidation
	Value), plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, in each case subject to customary adjustments as set forth in the Amended Series
	C Certificate of Designation. Holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate
	of 12% per annum, calculated based on an assumed price of $2,000 per share, payable in cash or in kind; provided that to the extent
	not paid in cash or by issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock on the last day of each calendar quarter (a “Dividend
	Payment Date”), all accrued dividends on any outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall accumulate and compound.
	In the event the Company has not paid in cash or by the issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock all accrued dividends
	on a Dividend Payment Date, at the election of holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock (the
	“Requisite Holders”), all such dividends accruing on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be paid in shares
	of Series C Preferred Stock. From and after the fifth anniversary of the issuance of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the
	Requisite Holders will have the right to elect to cause the Company to redeem, out of funds legally available therefore, all but
	not less than all of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for a price per share equal to the Series C Liquidation
	Value for such shares. In addition, the Company has the right to redeem at any time, out of funds legally available therefore,
	all or any portion of the then outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, for a price per share equal to the Series C Liquidation
	Value for such shares. The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into Common Stock or other securities of the Company, and
	does not have any voting rights. As a result of the redemption provisions, the Series C Preferred Stock has been classified outside

	Series D Convertible Preferred
	Stock



	 


	In connection with the execution
	of the Monroe Credit Agreement, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) with
	Monroe Capital Corporation, Monroe Capital Senior Secured Direct Loan Fund LP, Monroe Capital Senior Secured Direct Loan Fund (Unleveraged)
	LP and Monroe Capital Partners Fund II, LP. Pursuant to the Subscription Agreement, the Company issued 10 shares of $0.001 par
	value per share Series D convertible preferred stock (the “Series D Convertible Preferred Stock”).  Each share
	of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted at any time at the option of the holder into a number of shares of common
	stock initially equal to 752,807.8 shares of common stock. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has a mandatory conversion
	date on the tenth anniversary of the issuance date. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically, without any action
	on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Company’s
	common stock equal to the conversion number at the time in effect. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the
	Company’s Series A Preferred Stock and the Company’s Series B Preferred Stock. The Company’s Series C Preferred
	Stock ranks senior to the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock have the rights and preferences
	set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series D Certificate of Designation”).


	 


	In the event of any voluntary
	or involuntary liquidation, the holders of the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets
	of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders before any payment shall be made to the holders of junior securities.
	The Series C Preferred Stockholders would receive the Base Liquidation Value first, and not be entitled to the Excess Liquidation
	Value (as defined in the Amended Certificate of Designation of the Series C Preferred Stock) until the holders of the Series D
	Convertible Preferred Stock receive a pro rata Liquidation Value amount in cash. If at any time the Company redeems the outstanding
	shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock would have the right
	to elect to cause the Company to redeem, out of funds legally available therefore, all but not less than all of the then outstanding
	shares of Series D Preferred Stock, for a price per share equal to the Liquidation Value for such shares; provided that, prior
	to the Company paying the full redemption price for all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock, the Company would not be
	permitted to pay (i) any amounts in excess of the Series C Base Liquidation Value upon the redemption of shares of Series C Preferred
	Stock or (ii) any amounts upon the redemption of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of a voluntary or involuntary
	liquidation, each share of Series D Preferred Stock would be entitled to a liquidation preference in an amount equal to the amount
	per share that would have been payable had all shares of Series D Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock immediately
	prior to such event in accordance with the terms of the Series D Certificate of Designation, excluding for purposes of such calculation
	the liquidation preference payable to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of Series B Preferred Stock. The
	Series D Preferred Stock does not have any voting rights, except that the written consent of the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding
	Series D Preferred Stock shall be required for the Company to take certain actions, including the amendment of its certificate
	of incorporation or bylaws in a manner that adversely affects the relative rights, preferences, privileges or powers of holders
	of Series D Preferred Stock. As a result of the redemption provisions, the Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has been classified

	STOCKHOLDERS’
	EQUITY






	 



	Common Stock



	 


	The Company is authorized to
	issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock. Common stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters
	to be voted on by stockholders. Common stockholders have no conversion, preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no
	sinking fund or redemption provisions applicable to the common stock.


	 



	Common Stock Purchase Warrants



	 


	Common stock purchase warrants
	accounted for within equity are recorded at their initial fair value and reported in stockholders’ equity as increases to
	additional paid-in capital. Warrants reported as equity, rather than liabilities (i) may not be net-cash settled, (ii) have contractual
	limits on the number of shares to be delivered in a net-share settlement and (iii) are supported by sufficient unissued common
	shares available to settle the outstanding warrants. Subsequent changes in fair value from the warrants’ initial fair value
	are not recognized as long as the warrants continue to merit classification as equity.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and December
	31, 2016, respectively, warrants to purchase 187,564 and 455,514 shares of the Company’s common stock were outstanding (see
	Note 13). These warrants are not indexed to the Company’s stock, are considered a derivative and therefore, are being accounted
	for as a liability.

	INCOME
	TAXES






	  


	During the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred tax expense of approximately $95,000 and $36,000, respectively, on
	foreign income generated by the Company’s CTSAS subsidiary. The
	remaining income tax expense reflected for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, reflects tax expense
	on U.S. income generated. Due to management’s assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of certain
	deferred tax assets may not be realized, the Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $11.8 million as of March 31,
	2017 against its U.S. deferred tax asset, which was generated primarily as a result of foreign tax credits and net operating
	losses.

	Financing Arrangements with
	Related Parties 



	 


	In December 2012, the Company
	entered into a $2,100,000 unsecured promissory note with JFC Technologies, LLC (“JFC”), an entity controlled by James
	Schleck, a previous employee of CSP, who is an owner of a significant amount of the Company’s common shares and is a Board
	member. On November 19, 2013, the unsecured promissory note was amended (the “Amended JFC Note”). Pursuant to the Amended
	JFC Note, interest accrued at the rate of 12% per annum, retroactive to the date of the original note. On May 18, 2015, the Amended
	JFC Note of approximately $2.1 million and approximately $0.5 million of accrued interest on the Amended JFC Note were repaid in
	connection with the Company refinancing its debt. Pursuant to the Amended JFC Note, up to $1.0 million of the principal amount
	was convertible, at the option of JFC, into the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the portion of the principal
	amount being converted divided by the conversion price of $32.50 per share. On May 18, 2015, $650 was converted into 20 shares
	of Series A Preferred Stock issued to James Schleck.   


	 


	CSP leases property in
	Bound Brook, New Jersey, from Brook Industrial Park, LLC. on a month-to-month basis, at a monthly amount of approximately
	$30,000.


	 


	 


	Bayonet Capital Fund I, LLC,
	Brook Industrial Park, LLC and JFC are controlled by James Schleck. On July 30, 2014, 100 units of securities of the Company (the
	“Units”) were issued to Bayonet Capital Fund I, LLC (see Note 7), with each Unit comprising (1) one share of Series
	B Preferred Stock and (2) one share of Series C Preferred Stock.


	 





	Other Related Party Transactions



	 


	CSP sells product to Organic Dyes and Pigments, LLC (“Organic
	Dyes”). Michael Barry, a Board member of the Company, owns approximately 19% of Organic Dyes. Revenue from this CSP customer
	was less than $0.1 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The accounts receivable balances due from
	Organic Dyes were less than $0.1 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

	NET
	INCOME PER COMMON SHARE







	 



	Basic income per common share
	is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
	Diluted income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number
	of common shares and dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding. Potential common share equivalents consist of
	(i) shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options (using the “treasury stock” method), (ii) unvested restricted
	stock awards (using the “treasury stock” method) and (iii) shares issuable upon conversion of convertible notes and
	convertible preferred stock using the “if-converted” method.

	COMMITMENTS
	AND CONTINGENCIES






	 



	Legal



	 


	From time to time and in the
	ordinary course of business, the company may be subject to various claims, charges, and litigation. At March 31, 2017, the company
	did not have any pending claims, charges or litigation that it expects would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
	financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


	   








	13.






	FAIR
	VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES






	 


	Under U.S. GAAP, the Company
	is required to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value and may choose to record other financial assets and
	financial liabilities at fair value as well. Also under U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to record nonfinancial assets and liabilities
	at fair value due to events that may or may not recur in the future, such as an impairment event. When required to record such
	assets and liabilities at fair value, that fair value is estimated using an exit price, representing the amount that would be received
	to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. That fair value is determined
	based on significant inputs contained in a fair value hierarchy as follows:


	  








	Level 1





	Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets to which the Company has access at the measurement date.







	Level 2





	Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.







	Level 3





	Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.






	 


	The determination of where assets
	and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



	 



	There are three general valuation
	techniques that may be used to measure fair value, as described below:


	 






	Market Approach





	Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Prices may be indicated by pricing guides, sale transactions, market trades, or other sources.









	Cost Approach





	Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost).








	Income Approach





	Uses valuation techniques to
	convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the future amounts (includes present
	value techniques and option-pricing models).


	Net present value is an income
	approach where a stream of expected cash flows is discounted at an appropriate market interest rate.






	 






	Assets and Liabilities Measured
	at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



	 


	Assets and liabilities itemized

	The

	are determined using significant unobservable inputs into the Black-Scholes pricing model.

	The Company has other financial

	Company believes the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities approximate their fair value since those carrying amounts
	have been estimated to approximate the exit price which would be received to sell these assets or pay to transfer these liabilities
	to a market participant.


	 



	Assets and Liabilities Measured
	at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



	 


	During the three months ended
	March 31, 2017, none of the Company’s assets or liabilities were remeasured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and no
	assets were identified as impaired as of March 31, 2017.

	SUBSEQUENT
	EVENTS






	 


	Pursuant to the terms of the
	Monroe Credit Agreement, the Company expects to make an excess cash payment of approximately $0.6 million on or before May 17,
	2017, which will reduce the principal of the Company’s Term A Loan and the Delayed Draw Loan. The excess cash payment is
	calculated based on the definition of excess cash flow under the Monroe Credit Agreement.

	NEW
	ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS






	 


	The following are recent accounting
	pronouncements that have affected the Company’s consolidated financial statements or may affect the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements in the future.


	 


	In
	May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)
	No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)
	Topic 606.  The new revenue recognition standard relates to revenue from contracts with customers, which, along with amendments
	issued in 2015 and 2016, will supersede nearly all current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance. 
	The underlying principle is to use a five-step analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are
	transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
	The Company is in the initial stages of evaluating the effect of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements.
	The planned approach includes performing a detailed review of key contracts representative of the different businesses and comparing
	historical accounting policies and practices to the new accounting guidance. The Company will continue its evaluation of the standards
	update through the date of adoption. The Company plans to adopt this standard utilizing the modified retrospective approach.

	Cyalume Technologies Holdings, Inc.




	Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
	Statements



	 


	In January 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU No. 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10)

	(“ASU 2016-01”), which updates
	certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective
	for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption
	of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	 

	(Topic 842)

	(“ASU 2016-02”), which requires companies that are lessees to
	recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for most leases that do not meet the definition of a short-term lease. For
	income statement purposes, leases will continue to be classified as either operating or financing. Classification will be
	based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. This standard will result in extensive
	qualitative and quantitative disclosure changes. This standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
	December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. While the Company is currently assessing the impact
	ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements, the Company expects the primary impact upon adoption will be
	the recognition, on a discounted basis, of its minimum commitments under noncancellable operating leases on its consolidated balance
	sheets resulting in the recording of right of use assets and lease obligations.


	 


	In March 2016, the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09,

	Compensation-
	Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	(“ASU 2016-09”). The purpose
	of the update is to simplify several areas of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
	classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective
	for annual reporting periods after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. Early adoption is
	permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-19 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results
	of operations.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) – Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	(“ASU
	2016-15”), which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.
	ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that
	reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 should be applied using a retrospective transition
	method to each period presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its statement
	of cash flows.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued
	ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) – Restricted Cash

	(“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that
	a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described
	as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents. With this standard, amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted
	cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total
	amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
	2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption
	of ASU 2016-18 to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows and related disclosures.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued
	ASU 2017-04,

	Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment

	(“ASU
	2017-04”) which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment.
	A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed
	the carrying amount of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods
	within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted and applied prospectively. The Company does not expect ASU 2017-04 to
	have a material impact on its financial statements.

	During the first quarter of 2017, Chemical Light and Ammunition
	revenues were both approximately $0.1 million less than the first quarter of 2016. Specialty Products revenue during the first
	quarter of 2017 increased $2.1 million over the first quarter of 2016 as a result of an increase in product sales, as well as a
	price increase to Specialty Products customers.


	 


	Cost of goods sold for the first quarter
	of 2017 increased to approximately $5.8 million from the prior year amount of approximately $4.5 million as a result of the higher
	revenue levels during 2017. The gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2017 decreased to approximately 48.1% compared to
	a gross profit margin of approximately 51.2% for the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was largely attributable to a higher
	mix of lower-margin Specialty Product sales as well as manufacturing variances carried over from 2016 which were expensed during
	the first quarter of 2017.  


	  


	Sales and marketing expenses for the first
	quarter of 2017 were approximately $1.0 million, which was an increase of approximately $0.4 million compared to first quarter
	of 2016. This increase is the result of higher commissions on the increased Specialty Products sales levels, in addition to an
	increase in online marketing spend during 2017 compared to 2016.


	 


	General and administrative expenses for
	the first quarter of 2017 were approximately $2.0 million, versus approximately $2.1 million for the corresponding prior year period.
	The $0.1 million decrease was due to lower consulting fees, lower legal fees and a small decrease in various other corporate-related
	expenses and fees.


	 


	Research and development expenses of approximately
	$0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 increased slightly by approximately $0.1 million from the prior year. The increase was
	the result of additional research and development initiatives during 2017 as compared to 2016.


	 






	 



	19



	 







	 




	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016, we recorded tax expense of approximately $0.1 million and $36,000, respectively, on foreign income generated by
	our CTSAS subsidiary. The remaining income tax expense reflected for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively,
	reflects tax expense on U.S. income generated. We have a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax asset due to management’s
	assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of certain deferred tax assets may not be realized.


	 



	Material Changes in Financial Condition
	– March 31, 2017 versus December 31, 2016



	 


	Cash was approximately $1.2 million at
	March 31, 2017, representing a decrease of approximately $1.6 million from December 31, 2016. From December 31, 2016 to March 31,
	2017, combined accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by approximately $1.8 million; accounts receivable increased
	by approximately $1.4 million; and inventories decreased by approximately $0.2 million.


	 


	Our accounts receivable increased by approximately
	$1.6 million at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due to strong first quarter revenues and the timing of customer payments.
	Our receivables are generally collected within 30 to 45 days, thus revenues recorded in the 30-day period preceding the measurement
	date significantly influence the reported balances.


	  


	Accounts payable and accrued expenses
	combined were approximately $4.1 million at March 31, 2017 versus approximately $5.9 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease
	of approximately $1.8 million. Payments during the first quarter of 2017 on amounts accrued for at the end of 2016, such as the
	2016 accrued performance bonus amounts included within accrued expenses which were paid during the first quarter of 2016, are
	the primary reason for this decrease. We had a decrease in accrued expenses of approximately $1.7 million and a decrease in accounts
	payable of approximately $0.1 million at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. We had a balance of $1.0 million outstanding
	on our line of credit at March 31, 2017, which we use to meet temporary working capital needs. We did not have a balance outstanding
	under our line of credit at December 31, 2016.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	On May 18, 2015, we entered into a credit
	agreement with Monroe Capital Management Advisors, LLC as administrative agent and lead arranger (the “Agent”) and
	the various lenders party thereto (the “Monroe Credit Agreement”). The Monroe Credit Agreement provides for a total
	borrowing commitment of $25.0 million (the “Monroe Credit Facility”) in the form of (i) a $5.0 million revolving credit
	facility (the “Monroe Line of Credit”); (ii) an $18.0 million senior secured term loan (the “Term A Loan”)
	and (iii) a $2.0 million delayed draw term loan (the “Delayed Draw Loan”). 


	 


	On August 3, 2015, we entered into a First
	Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Monroe Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the Monroe Credit
	Agreement was amended to, among other things, reduce the aggregate amount of the Delayed Draw Loan under the Credit Agreement from
	$2.0 million to $1.5 million. On August 3, 2015, the full amount of the Delayed Draw Loan was funded to us, $1.4 million of which
	was used to make a payment in connection with a legal settlement agreement and the remaining $100,000 of which was paid to the
	Agent as a deferred closing fee. The First Amendment also modified, for certain periods during the term of the Credit Agreement,
	(i) the maximum senior debt to EBITDA ratio that the Company is required to maintain and (ii) the applicable limits on the Company’s
	aggregate permitted capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.


	 


	Under the terms of the Monroe Credit Agreement,
	the Company is able to borrow under the Monroe Line of Credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of: (i) $5.0 million; and (ii)
	the sum of 85% of all eligible accounts receivable plus 60% of all eligible inventory. Additionally, while the loans are outstanding
	we must maintain: (a) a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.00; (b) a senior debt to EBITDA ratio initially of 4.50 to 1.00,
	decreasing to 1.50 to 1.00 over the term of the loans; and (c) a twelve month trailing EBITDA, measured quarterly, with the amounts
	ranging from $4,750,000, increasing up to $7.0 million over the term of the loans.


	 


	The Term A Loan provides for quarterly
	amortization payments on the last day of each calendar quarter, commencing on June 30, 2015, in an aggregate principal amount equal
	to $112,500, increasing to $225,000 on June 30, 2016, and increasing to $450,000 on June 30, 2017, with the balance payable on
	the termination date of May 18, 2020 (the “Termination Date”). The Delayed Draw Loan provides for quarterly amortization
	payments on the last day of each calendar quarter, in an aggregate principal amount equal to 0.625% of the original principal amount
	of the Delayed Draw Loan, increasing to 1.25% on March 31, 2016, and increasing to 2.5% on March 31, 2017, with the balance payable
	on the Termination Date. The Monroe Line of Credit is payable on the Termination Date.

	As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	we had approximately $1.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, of cash on hand. The major sources and uses of cash during 2017
	were all in the normal course of business. Our availability under the Monroe Line of Credit was approximately $4.0 million
	at March 31, 2017 and approximately $3.9 million at December 31, 2016.


	 


	Capital expenditures and payments for intangibles
	were approximately $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. We expect to fund capital expenditures for the remainder
	of 2017 from existing cash and operating cash flows.


	 


	We were in compliance with our financial
	covenants relating to our loans as of March 31, 2017. We expect to meet our financial covenants for 2017 and we also expect that
	cash provided by the business will be adequate to meet our planned needs during 2017.


	 


	Pursuant to the terms of the Monroe Credit
	Agreement, we plan to make an excess cash payment of approximately $0.6 million on or before May 17, 2017, which will reduce the
	principal of our Term A Loan and our Delayed Draw Loan. The excess cash payment is calculated based on the definition of excess
	cash flow under the Monroe Credit Agreement and is related to favorable financial performance, primarily relating to cash flow
	generation.


	 


	We did not pay a dividend in 2017 and we
	do not have plans to pay a common dividend in the future. We are accruing dividends in connection with the Series A Convertible
	Preferred Stock issued on November 19, 2013 and the Series C Preferred Stock issued
	on July 30, 2014.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates
	are used when accounting for certain items such as reserves for inventory, accounts receivable and deferred tax assets; assessing
	the carrying value of intangible assets including goodwill; determining the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible
	assets; determining asset retirement obligations; and determining the fair value of contingent consideration. Estimates are based
	on historical experience, where applicable, and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the
	inherent uncertainty involved with estimates, actual results may differ.


	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 


	Revenue from the sale of products or the
	providing of services is recognized when the earnings process is complete, the amount of recognizable revenue can be determined,
	the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. Depending on the
	terms of the individual sales arrangement with our customer, product sales are recognized at either the shipping point or upon
	receipt by the customer. Costs and related expenses to manufacture the products are recorded as costs of goods sold when the related
	revenue is recognized. Additionally, if the right of return is granted to the buyer in a product sale, revenue is deferred until
	enough historical customer data is available to reasonably estimate returns and related costs. 


	 


	We have two significant contracts providing
	for the sale of indefinite quantities of products at fixed per unit prices, subject to adjustment for certain economic factors.
	Revenue under these contracts is recognized when products ordered under the contracts are received by the customer. Whenever costs
	change, we review the pricing under these contracts to determine whether they require the sale of products at a loss. To date,
	we have no loss contracts which would require the accrual of future losses in the current financial statements.


	 


	We also provide research and development
	services for customers for which we earn payments that are contingent upon achieving a specific result (“milestones”).
	Upon achieving such milestones, revenue is recognized provided the payment is (i) related to past performance, (ii) reasonable
	relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement with our customer, and (iii) nonrefundable.


	 




	Warrants Liability




	 


	We use fair values as determined by significant
	unobservable inputs. These estimated values are significant inputs into the Black Scholes pricing model used to calculate the estimated
	fair value of warrants potentially settleable in cash, which are recorded as warrants liability. The estimated fair value of the
	common warrants are determined at each balance sheet date and the change in the estimated fair value of the warrants is reflected
	within our statements of comprehensive income. 


	 






	 



	21



	 







	 




	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
	determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted
	tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are recognized when,
	based upon available evidence, realization of the assets is more likely than not.


	 


	In assessing the realization of long-term
	deferred income tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized.
	The realization of deferred income tax assets depends upon future taxable income in years before net operating loss carryforwards
	expire. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets on a quarterly basis. If we determine that it is more likely
	than not that deferred income tax assets will not be recovered, we establish a valuation allowance against some or all deferred
	income tax assets.


	 


	When tax returns are filed, it is highly
	certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty
	about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position
	is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, it is more likely than not
	that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax
	positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition
	threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement
	 with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefit associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount
	measured as described above, if such a position existed, would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the
	accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon
	examination. There were no such positions as of March 31, 3017 or December 31, 2016.


	 


	We classify interest on tax deficiencies
	as interest expense and income tax penalties as other expense.  


	 


	In September 2015, the IRS completed an
	audit of our tax return for the year 2013. There were no adjustments to our 2013 tax return. Our tax returns filed for the 2014
	and 2015 years are still open for audit. The tax return for 2015 was filed on September 15, 2016 under a filing extension. The
	tax return for 2016 is expected to be filed under a filing extension prior to September 15, 2017.




	 






	Goodwill




	 


	Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite
	life and accordingly, is not subject to amortization. Goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review, and, if conditions warrant,
	interim impairment reviews. Impairment charges, if any, are recorded in the period in which the impairment is determined.


	 


	Our business is managed and
	financial results are reported as one segment. The Company’s one operating segment consists of three reporting units:
	Chemical Light (the operations of CTI, CTS and CTSAS), Specialty Products (the operations of CSP) and Other (the parent
	company Cyalume Technologies Holdings, Inc.).


	 


	We perform the traditional two-step process for assessing goodwill
	for impairment. The first step of the two-step process requires a comparison of our estimated fair value for each reporting unit
	versus our carrying (book) value. If our carrying value exceeded our fair value, further analysis (step 2 of the two-step process)
	is required to determine the amount, if any, that our goodwill was impaired. To determine the amount of fair value, we used a discounted
	cash flow analysis.



	 





	Intangible Assets




	 


	Intangible assets include developed technologies
	and patents, customer relationships, customer backlog, non-compete agreements and certain trade names, which are amortized over
	their estimated useful lives, and other trademarks and trade names, which are considered to have indefinite useful lives and therefore
	are not amortized. The carrying amounts of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
	indicate that those carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Additionally, the carrying amounts of non-amortizing intangible assets
	are reviewed for impairment annually every August 31. Costs incurred to register new patents or defend existing patents are capitalized
	while costs to renew or extend the term of intangible assets are expensed when incurred.



	 





	Inventories




	 


	Inventories are stated at the lower of
	cost (on a first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method) or net realizable value. We periodically review the realizability of
	inventory. Provisions are recorded for potential obsolescence which requires management’s judgment. Conditions impacting
	the realizability of inventory could cause actual write-offs to be materially different than provisions for obsolescence.


	 




	Foreign Operations and Currency




	 


	Accounts of our foreign subsidiary are
	recorded using their local currency (the euro) as the functional currency. For consolidation, revenues and expenses are converted
	to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate for the month in which they were recorded. Assets and liabilities are converted
	to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Equity transactions are converted to U.S. dollars
	using the exchange rate in effect as of the date of the transaction. Translation gains and losses are reported as a component of
	accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. Gains and losses resulting from transactions which are denominated in other than
	the functional currencies are reported as other income, net in the statement of comprehensive income in the period the gain or
	loss occurred.

	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The following are recent accounting pronouncements
	that have affected our consolidated financial statements or may affect them in the future.


	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	, as a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606.  The new revenue recognition standard
	relates to revenue from contracts with customers, which, along with amendments issued in 2015 and 2016, will supersede nearly all
	current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate industry-specific guidance.  The underlying principle is to use a five-step
	analysis of transactions to recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects
	the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The Company is in the initial stages of evaluating
	the effect of adopting ASU 2014-09 on its consolidated financial statements. The planned approach includes performing a detailed
	review of key contracts representative of the different businesses and comparing historical accounting policies and practices to
	the new accounting guidance. The Company will continue its evaluation of the standards update through the date of adoption. The
	Company plans to adopt this standard utilizing the modified retrospective approach. 


	   


	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10)

	(“ASU 2016-01”), which updates certain aspects of recognition,
	measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company beginning in its
	first quarter of 2019 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a
	material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	 

	(Topic 842)

	(“ASU 2016-02”), which requires companies that are lessees to recognize a right-of-use
	asset and lease liability for most leases that do not meet the definition of a short-term lease. For income statement purposes,
	leases will continue to be classified as either operating or financing. Classification will be based on criteria that are
	largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting. This standard will result in extensive qualitative and quantitative
	disclosure changes. This standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including
	interim periods within that reporting period. While the Company is currently assessing the impact ASU No. 2016-02 will have on
	its consolidated financial statements, the Company expects the primary impact upon adoption will be the recognition, on a discounted
	basis, of its minimum commitments under noncancellable operating leases on its consolidated balance sheets resulting in the recording
	of right of use assets and lease obligations.


	 


	In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09,

	Compensation- Stock Compensation
	(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	(“ASU 2016-09”). The purpose of the update
	is to simplify several areas of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
	of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual
	reporting periods after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal periods. Early adoption is permitted.
	The adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.


	 


	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) – Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	(“ASU 2016-15”),
	which clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15
	is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period.
	Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period
	presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) – Restricted Cash

	(“ASU 2016-18”), which requires that a statement
	of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted
	cash and restricted cash equivalents. With this standard, amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents
	should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning of period and end of period total amounts shown
	on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including
	interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-18
	to have a material impact on its statement of cash flows and related disclosures.


	 


	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04,

	Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment

	(“ASU 2017-04”)
	which removes the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. A goodwill impairment
	will now be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount
	of goodwill. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual
	periods. Early adoption is permitted and applied prospectively. We do not expect ASU 2017-04 to have a material impact to our financial
	statements.

	Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
	SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including principal executive and
	financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to
	the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention
	or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable
	assurance of achieving their control objectives.


	 


	Our management carried out an evaluation,
	under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), of the effectiveness
	of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2017. Based upon that evaluation, our management, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
	were effective as of March 31, 2017.



	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	 


	There was no change in our internal control
	over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
