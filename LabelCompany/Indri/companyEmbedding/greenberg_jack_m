Jack M. Greenberg (born September 28, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois) was Chairman and CEO of McDonald's Corporation from 1999 through 2002, when he was replaced by James Richard Cantalupo. He was promoted to CEO in 1998, succeeding Michael R. Quinlan in that role as Quinlan retained the title of Chairman.
A 21-year veteran of the company, Greenberg held the top spot during a tumultuous period, with the company suffering earnings declines in each of the last seven quarters of his tenure. As Greenberg explained, "We were going through a transition from what I call a founder's company to a modern, global enterprise. There is a cultural shift from what we were to where we want to end up."[citation needed]
A graduate of the DePaul University College of Commerce (renamed the Driehaus College of Business in 2012), Greenberg also earned a juris doctor degree from the DePaul University College of Law. He is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Illinois CPA Society and the Chicago Bar Association, where he served as former chairman of the federal tax committee, and was president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Bar Foundation. Greenberg is a member of the DePaul University Board of Trustees. Greenberg is currently Non-Executive Chairman and Presiding Director of The Western Union Company.[1]
He originated the "Made for You" production system,[2] a cooking platform that facilitated a broader variety of menu offerings by allowing stores to precook meat patties and finish them to order. Previously the McDonald's chain had used a "build to stock" manufacturing process, precooking, dressing and wrapping most food prior to receiving customer orders. By postponing the finishing process (dressing and wrapping sandwiches), McDonald's could offer a wider variety of sandwich combinations without significantly increasing customer wait time.[3]
Cradles to Crayons is a national non-profit organization dedicated to serving children in need of basic necessities. In early 2016, the organization appointed Greenberg to be chairman of Cradles to Crayons Chicago, a location that he was very active in establishing. The organization also tapped Greenberg to be a member of the National Board of Directors.
Awards[edit]
Jack M. Greenberg was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2003 in the area of Business.[4]

Early life
Greenberg was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York on December 22, 1924.[7][8][9]
During World War II, Greenberg served in the United States Navy and fought at Okinawa and Iwo Jima.[10] Greenberg commanded a landing craft in the invasion of Iheya Shima, one of the final campaigns of the war.[11] During his service, he was disturbed by racial prejudice he perceived in the Navy, and was threatened with a court martial for shouting at a superior officer in defense of a black crewman that he felt was being mistreated.[12]
After an interruption due to his war service Greenberg graduated from Columbia College with a B.A. in 1945. He further received an LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1948, and an LL.D. from Columbia Law in 1984.[4][13]
Career
Civil and human rights lawyer
Greenberg became the only white legal counselor for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund ("LDF") in 1949, and, in 1961, succeeded Thurgood Marshall as LDF's Director-Counsel.
Greenberg recalled his earliest arguments before the Supreme Court, saying:

"It was like a religious experience; the first few times I was there I was full of awe. I had an almost tactile feeling. The first time I was in the Court, I wasn't arguing. I felt as if I were in a synagogue, and reached to see whether or not I had a yarmulke on. I thought I ought to have one on."[14]

In addition to arguing Brown v. Board of Education as co-counsel with Thurgood Marshall,[15] other cases Greenberg argued include Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, which ordered the end of segregated school systems "at once", and Griggs v. Duke Power Company,[16] which outlawed basing employment and promotion decisions on the results of tests with a discriminatory impact. He also argued Furman v. Georgia (1972),[17][18] in which the Court held that the death penalty as it was then applied was a violation of the "cruel and unusual punishment" clause of the Eighth Amendment.
Greenberg was a founding member of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) and of Human Rights Watch.[19][20]
Educator
Greenberg was an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School from 1970–84, a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School in 1971, and a visiting professor at College of the City of New York in 1977.
In 1982, he was appointed to co-teach Julius L. Chambers' class on race law at Harvard Law School. The university declined to replace Greenberg with a black professor, so black students boycotted the class.[21] When asked if he was frightened to pass through a group of protesters on his way to class the first day, Greenberg said, "No, I was on the beach at Iwo Jima."[22]
Greenberg left LDF in 1984 to become a professor and Vice Dean at Columbia Law School. He served as Dean of Columbia College from 1989 to 1993.[4] Greenberg's teaching interests include constitutional law, civil rights, and human rights law, civil procedure, "Kafka and the Law", and South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. As of fall 2013, Greenberg still taught at Columbia Law School, and served as a senior director of LDF.
He was also a distinguished visiting professor at University of Tokyo Faculty of Law in 1993-94 and at St. Louis University Law School in 1994, and a visiting professor at Lewis and Clark Law School in 1994 and 1996, at Princeton University in 1995, at the University of Munich in 1998, at Tokyo University in 1996 and 1998, at the University of Nuremberg-Erlangen in 1999-2000, and at Hebrew University in 2005.
Author
Greenberg has varied intellectual interests: aside from several books on law and civil rights, including Crusaders in the Courts,[23] he has written a cookbook (Dean Cuisine,[24] with Harvard Law School Dean James Vorenberg), and appeared as a panelist for a New York Times tasting of Oregon pinot noir. He also edited Franz Kafka: The Office Writings (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008) with two other scholars.[25]
Awards and honors

In 2001, Greenberg was awarded a Presidential Citizens Medal.[26] President Bill Clinton commented "In the courtroom and the classroom, Jack Greenberg has been a crusader for freedom and equality for more than half a century."[27]
In 1998, Greenberg was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[28]
In 1996, Greenberg received the Thurgood Marshall Award of the American Bar Association for his long-term contributions to the advancement of civil rights, civil liberties, and human rights in the U.S.[29]
Greenberg received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Notre Dame University in 2005[30] and an honorary degree from Howard University in 2004.[19]
In December 2009, Greenberg received Columbia Law School's Lawrence A. Wien Prize for Social Responsibility.[5] In January 2014, a daylong symposium in his Greenberg's honor was held at Columbia Law School.[10]

Early life
Greenberg was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York on December 22, 1924.[7][8][9]
During World War II, Greenberg served in the United States Navy and fought at Okinawa and Iwo Jima.[10] Greenberg commanded a landing craft in the invasion of Iheya Shima, one of the final campaigns of the war.[11] During his service, he was disturbed by racial prejudice he perceived in the Navy, and was threatened with a court martial for shouting at a superior officer in defense of a black crewman that he felt was being mistreated.[12]
After an interruption due to his war service Greenberg graduated from Columbia College with a B.A. in 1945. He further received an LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1948, and an LL.D. from Columbia Law in 1984.[4][13]
Career
Civil and human rights lawyer
Greenberg became the only white legal counselor for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund ("LDF") in 1949, and, in 1961, succeeded Thurgood Marshall as LDF's Director-Counsel.
Greenberg recalled his earliest arguments before the Supreme Court, saying:

"It was like a religious experience; the first few times I was there I was full of awe. I had an almost tactile feeling. The first time I was in the Court, I wasn't arguing. I felt as if I were in a synagogue, and reached to see whether or not I had a yarmulke on. I thought I ought to have one on."[14]

In addition to arguing Brown v. Board of Education as co-counsel with Thurgood Marshall,[15] other cases Greenberg argued include Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, which ordered the end of segregated school systems "at once", and Griggs v. Duke Power Company,[16] which outlawed basing employment and promotion decisions on the results of tests with a discriminatory impact. He also argued Furman v. Georgia (1972),[17][18] in which the Court held that the death penalty as it was then applied was a violation of the "cruel and unusual punishment" clause of the Eighth Amendment.
Greenberg was a founding member of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) and of Human Rights Watch.[19][20]
Educator
Greenberg was an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School from 1970–84, a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School in 1971, and a visiting professor at College of the City of New York in 1977.
In 1982, he was appointed to co-teach Julius L. Chambers' class on race law at Harvard Law School. The university declined to replace Greenberg with a black professor, so black students boycotted the class.[21] When asked if he was frightened to pass through a group of protesters on his way to class the first day, Greenberg said, "No, I was on the beach at Iwo Jima."[22]
Greenberg left LDF in 1984 to become a professor and Vice Dean at Columbia Law School. He served as Dean of Columbia College from 1989 to 1993.[4] Greenberg's teaching interests include constitutional law, civil rights, and human rights law, civil procedure, "Kafka and the Law", and South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. As of fall 2013, Greenberg still taught at Columbia Law School, and served as a senior director of LDF.
He was also a distinguished visiting professor at University of Tokyo Faculty of Law in 1993-94 and at St. Louis University Law School in 1994, and a visiting professor at Lewis and Clark Law School in 1994 and 1996, at Princeton University in 1995, at the University of Munich in 1998, at Tokyo University in 1996 and 1998, at the University of Nuremberg-Erlangen in 1999-2000, and at Hebrew University in 2005.
Author
Greenberg has varied intellectual interests: aside from several books on law and civil rights, including Crusaders in the Courts,[23] he has written a cookbook (Dean Cuisine,[24] with Harvard Law School Dean James Vorenberg), and appeared as a panelist for a New York Times tasting of Oregon pinot noir. He also edited Franz Kafka: The Office Writings (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008) with two other scholars.[25]
Awards and honors

In 2001, Greenberg was awarded a Presidential Citizens Medal.[26] President Bill Clinton commented "In the courtroom and the classroom, Jack Greenberg has been a crusader for freedom and equality for more than half a century."[27]
In 1998, Greenberg was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[28]
In 1996, Greenberg received the Thurgood Marshall Award of the American Bar Association for his long-term contributions to the advancement of civil rights, civil liberties, and human rights in the U.S.[29]
Greenberg received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Notre Dame University in 2005[30] and an honorary degree from Howard University in 2004.[19]
In December 2009, Greenberg received Columbia Law School's Lawrence A. Wien Prize for Social Responsibility.[5] In January 2014, a daylong symposium in his Greenberg's honor was held at Columbia Law School.[10]

Early life
Greenberg was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York on December 22, 1924.[7][8][9]
During World War II, Greenberg served in the United States Navy and fought at Okinawa and Iwo Jima.[10] Greenberg commanded a landing craft in the invasion of Iheya Shima, one of the final campaigns of the war.[11] During his service, he was disturbed by racial prejudice he perceived in the Navy, and was threatened with a court martial for shouting at a superior officer in defense of a black crewman that he felt was being mistreated.[12]
After an interruption due to his war service Greenberg graduated from Columbia College with a B.A. in 1945. He further received an LL.B. from Columbia Law School in 1948, and an LL.D. from Columbia Law in 1984.[4][13]
Career
Civil and human rights lawyer
Greenberg became the only white legal counselor for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund ("LDF") in 1949, and, in 1961, succeeded Thurgood Marshall as LDF's Director-Counsel.
Greenberg recalled his earliest arguments before the Supreme Court, saying:

"It was like a religious experience; the first few times I was there I was full of awe. I had an almost tactile feeling. The first time I was in the Court, I wasn't arguing. I felt as if I were in a synagogue, and reached to see whether or not I had a yarmulke on. I thought I ought to have one on."[14]

In addition to arguing Brown v. Board of Education as co-counsel with Thurgood Marshall,[15] other cases Greenberg argued include Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, which ordered the end of segregated school systems "at once", and Griggs v. Duke Power Company,[16] which outlawed basing employment and promotion decisions on the results of tests with a discriminatory impact. He also argued Furman v. Georgia (1972),[17][18] in which the Court held that the death penalty as it was then applied was a violation of the "cruel and unusual punishment" clause of the Eighth Amendment.
Greenberg was a founding member of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF) and of Human Rights Watch.[19][20]
Educator
Greenberg was an adjunct professor at Columbia Law School from 1970–84, a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School in 1971, and a visiting professor at College of the City of New York in 1977.
In 1982, he was appointed to co-teach Julius L. Chambers' class on race law at Harvard Law School. The university declined to replace Greenberg with a black professor, so black students boycotted the class.[21] When asked if he was frightened to pass through a group of protesters on his way to class the first day, Greenberg said, "No, I was on the beach at Iwo Jima."[22]
Greenberg left LDF in 1984 to become a professor and Vice Dean at Columbia Law School. He served as Dean of Columbia College from 1989 to 1993.[4] Greenberg's teaching interests include constitutional law, civil rights, and human rights law, civil procedure, "Kafka and the Law", and South Africa's post-apartheid constitution. As of fall 2013, Greenberg still taught at Columbia Law School, and served as a senior director of LDF.
He was also a distinguished visiting professor at University of Tokyo Faculty of Law in 1993-94 and at St. Louis University Law School in 1994, and a visiting professor at Lewis and Clark Law School in 1994 and 1996, at Princeton University in 1995, at the University of Munich in 1998, at Tokyo University in 1996 and 1998, at the University of Nuremberg-Erlangen in 1999-2000, and at Hebrew University in 2005.
Author
Greenberg has varied intellectual interests: aside from several books on law and civil rights, including Crusaders in the Courts,[23] he has written a cookbook (Dean Cuisine,[24] with Harvard Law School Dean James Vorenberg), and appeared as a panelist for a New York Times tasting of Oregon pinot noir. He also edited Franz Kafka: The Office Writings (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2008) with two other scholars.[25]
Awards and honors

In 2001, Greenberg was awarded a Presidential Citizens Medal.[26] President Bill Clinton commented "In the courtroom and the classroom, Jack Greenberg has been a crusader for freedom and equality for more than half a century."[27]
In 1998, Greenberg was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[28]
In 1996, Greenberg received the Thurgood Marshall Award of the American Bar Association for his long-term contributions to the advancement of civil rights, civil liberties, and human rights in the U.S.[29]
Greenberg received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Notre Dame University in 2005[30] and an honorary degree from Howard University in 2004.[19]
In December 2009, Greenberg received Columbia Law School's Lawrence A. Wien Prize for Social Responsibility.[5] In January 2014, a daylong symposium in his Greenberg's honor was held at Columbia Law School.[10]

Chicago, Illinois U.S.


Nationality
American


Education
DePaul University


Occupation
Accountant, Business executive, President, CEO McDonald's, 1999-2002


Years active
1981-2002


Spouse(s)

Children
Ilyse Greenberg, Alison Greenberg, David Greenberg


Jack M. Greenberg (born September 28, 1942 in Chicago, Illinois) was Chairman and CEO of McDonald's Corporation from 1999 through 2002, when he was replaced by James Richard Cantalupo. He was promoted to CEO in 1998, succeeding Michael R. Quinlan in that role as Quinlan retained the title of Chairman.
A 21-year veteran of the company, Greenberg held the top spot during a tumultuous period, with the company suffering earnings declines in each of the last seven quarters of his tenure. As Greenberg explained, "We were going through a transition from what I call a founder's company to a modern, global enterprise. There is a cultural shift from what we were to where we want to end up."[citation needed]
A graduate of the DePaul University College of Commerce (renamed the Driehaus College of Business in 2012), Greenberg also earned a juris doctor degree from the DePaul University College of Law. He is a certified public accountant and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Illinois CPA Society and the Chicago Bar Association, where he served as former chairman of the federal tax committee, and was president of the board of trustees of the Chicago Bar Foundation. Greenberg is a member of the DePaul University Board of Trustees. Greenberg is currently Non-Executive Chairman and Presiding Director of The Western Union Company.[1]
He originated the "Made for You" production system,[2] a cooking platform that facilitated a broader variety of menu offerings by allowing stores to precook meat patties and finish them to order. Previously the McDonald's chain had used a "build to stock" manufacturing process, precooking, dressing and wrapping most food prior to receiving customer orders. By postponing the finishing process (dressing and wrapping sandwiches), McDonald's could offer a wider variety of sandwich combinations without significantly increasing customer wait time.[3]
Cradles to Crayons is a national non-profit organization dedicated to serving children in need of basic necessities. In early 2016, the organization appointed Greenberg to be chairman of Cradles to Crayons Chicago, a location that he was very active in establishing. The organization also tapped Greenberg to be a member of the National Board of Directors.
Awards[edit]
Jack M. Greenberg was inducted as a Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois and awarded the Order of Lincoln (the State’s highest honor) by the Governor of Illinois in 2003 in the area of Business.[4]
