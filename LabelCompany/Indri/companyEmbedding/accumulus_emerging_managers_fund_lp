                        It took 21 days from signing our contract to having our system deployed to our investors. All we had to do was give the Juniper Square team access to our spreadsheets and systems, and they took care of the rest. The team is professional, they know real estate and our business, and they make the process painless. I can highly recommend Juniper Square.
