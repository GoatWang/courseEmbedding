About | Mark Ashby Design






























 
















 












Mark Ashby
Principal
A Louisiana native, Mark has always been interested in design, decorative arts, and interior spaces.  His first jobs in design came in Monroe where he earned a BA in Sociology at the University of Louisiana.  While attending school, Mark developed a reputation for having a good eye and he began doing residential decorating and a variety of commercial design projects for faculty members and others around Monroe.  Upon graduation he was offered a spot in the graduate landscape Design Program at the LSU School of Architecture, but he recognized that his true interest was interior spaces. In 1998 he moved to Austin where he began decorating full time.  Over the years his business evolved into its current form as the interiors firm of Mark Ashby Design.
Mark’s approach is defined by a deep reverence for history and architectural context combined with a refined, contemporary aesthetic.  He is a true collaborator, engaging his clients and his design team to ensure that each project is a thoughtful expression of the client’s own style and sensibilities.
Mark and his designers work on projects across the southwest and around the country.  The firm’s work has been featured in the books Great Homes of Texas and Modern Cabins, as well as in a number of publications, including Southern Living, Better Homes and Gardens, Traditional Home, and Western Interiors.


Anne Grandinetti

Raised in Houston, Anne received her BA in sociology at the University of Oklahoma.  She began her career in interiors shortly thereafter in Houston as the manager of a high-end home furnishings store which lead to her initial work as a decorator.  She went on to spend eight years in the celebrity and fashion public relations business in Los Angeles before moving to Austin in 2008 to return to the interiors industry and join Mark Ashby Design.


Michele Lorenz

Liv Kinsey
Designer
Born and raised in New York, Liv moved to Texas during high school, and then attended Texas Tech University where she received a bachelor’s degree in elementary education.  After a brief time back in New York in fashion promotion, Liv moved to Austin to work in the music and film industries.  Her work there included wardrobe design, art direction, and eventually set design which lead to her interest in transforming spaces and her move to interiors. She joined Mark Ashby Design in 2011.


Amanda Viens
Senior Design Assistant
Originally from Pennsylvania, Amanda lived in Philadelphia where she received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tyler School of Art with a concentration in Metalsmithing/Jewelry/CAD-CAM.
