History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Jesse Lipson, a self-taught programmer, built and launched ShareFile in November 2005 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[1]
Lipson created ShareFile after several of his website design clients asked him to build a password-protected area where they could set up folders and exchange business files with their clients. He felt FTP sites of the time were insufficient and saw an opportunity to create a web-based product.[1][2] ShareFile launched without a free version or outside funding, and focused on acquiring only business customers.[1]
By 2011, ShareFile had 3 million users in 100 countries.[1] ShareFile was included on the Inc. 500 list of Fastest Growing Private Companies in both 2010 and 2011.[3]
Acquisition by Citrix Systems[edit]
In October 2011, ShareFile was acquired by Citrix Systems.[4] Under terms of the agreement, ShareFile was offered as a standalone service in addition to its software becoming integrated into Citrix products. With the acquisition, Lipson became vice president and general manager of a new data sharing division within Citrix under the deal.[5][6] As of 2016, Lipson is corporate vice president and general manager of cloud services, which includes ShareFile and Citrix Workspace Cloud.[7]
A new 171,000-square-foot Raleigh office opened in October 2014 for Raleigh-based Citrix employees.[8][9] As of April 2015, ShareFile had 55,000 corporate customers and 40 million users.[10]
Product overview[edit]
ShareFile is a secure, cloud-based platform for businesses to store and share large files.[1][5] Businesses are able to create branded, password-protected areas for files through the service. The software has a client-portal feature businesses can set up and customize to allow outside vendors and clients access to specific projects and files.[11] Other ShareFile features include the ability to send and obtain e-signatures on documents with the integration of RightSignature;[12] the ability to send encrypted email through a Microsoft Outlook plugin or an online portal,[13] Office 365 connection to access and edit documents stored in SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business;[14] and the ability for individuals to migrate data from their personal clouds into ShareFile.[15] There are also mobile app versions of ShareFile, which allow mobile editing and offline editing of documents.[16]
Security features[edit]
ShareFile users have the option to store data in their own data centers, Citrix-managed data centers, or use existing file storage systems via StorageZone Connectors. This allows companies to host files that they do not want stored in the cloud, in some cases due to regulatory concerns.[17] IT managers can manage corporate content on ShareFile using remote wipe, encryption, passcode lock and poison pill features. In addition, companies are able to restrict third-party editing tools that employees might try to install on their devices, and audit content accessed from a device that has been lost or stolen.[16][18]
Industry-specific features[edit]
In response to updated regulations with HIPAA standards, Citrix created ShareFile Cloud for Health Care in 2013. This private virtual cloud was designed to help companies stay compliant with updated HIPAA standards. It runs on the AWS Cloud, but sets aside specific virtual servers to host protected health information (PHI).[19] Also in 2013, ShareFile began offering a feature called "Archiving for Financial Services" to help organizations in the financial sector comply with data archiving regulations put forth by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[20]

Early life and education[edit]
Lipson was born in Iowa City, Iowa in 1977.[1] He grew up in Maryland and began a business selling card tricks to magic stores when he was 14.[2][3]
He attended Duke University where he majored in philosophy.[1] During college, he started several more ventures, including EasyCentral, a password and form manager.[4] Following his graduation from Duke in 2000, Lipson worked for an internet start-up called FullSeven that developed branding for company e-mails during the first dot com boom.[2][5] He acquired web design skills in the position, which he then parlayed into his own web development business called novelProjects. The company eventually split into three businesses.[6][7]
In 2001, Lipson inherited his father's pharmaceutical market research company, Rapidata.net. Within two years he helped grow the company's revenue by 500%. The company was sold to Greenfield Online in 2005 and Lipson used the profits to help fund ShareFile.[6][8]
ShareFile[edit]
Lipson built and launched ShareFile in November 2005 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[9][10] The idea stemmed from requests by several of his website design clients to provide a password-protected area for file exchange. Lipson aimed to update traditional FTP methods with ShareFile.[11]
He bootstrapped ShareFile and focused immediately on procuring only business customers. By 2011, Lipson had grown the company to 4 million users with no outside capital.[11]
In 2011, ShareFile was acquired by Citrix Systems. Lipson became vice president and general manager of Citrix Systems' newly formed data sharing product group, including ShareFile.[12] He helped inspire and oversee the expansion of a major Citrix office in downtown Raleigh’s Warehouse District, which opened in 2014.[1][10][13] As of 2016, Lipson is the corporate vice president and general manager of Citrix Cloud Services.[9]
On February 21st 2017 Lipson announced he would be leaving his position as corporate vice president and general manager of the Cloud Services Business Unit at Citrix in March 2017.
Other roles[edit]
Lipson is a founding partner of the Raleigh-based HQ Raleigh, a shared workspace.[1]
He has served on the board of directors of Yext, a startup that maintains web listings for businesses, since 2012.[14] In 2013, he started ThinkHouse, a coliving space and accelerator, for entrepreneurs.[15]
Lipson, along with his wife, spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention about entrepreneurship.[9][16]
Personal life[edit]
Lipson lives in Raleigh, NC and is married to entrepreneur Brooks Bell.[1][10]

Early life and education[edit]
Lipson was born in Iowa City, Iowa in 1977.[1] He grew up in Maryland and began a business selling card tricks to magic stores when he was 14.[2][3]
He attended Duke University where he majored in philosophy.[1] During college, he started several more ventures, including EasyCentral, a password and form manager.[4] Following his graduation from Duke in 2000, Lipson worked for an internet start-up called FullSeven that developed branding for company e-mails during the first dot com boom.[2][5] He acquired web design skills in the position, which he then parlayed into his own web development business called novelProjects. The company eventually split into three businesses.[6][7]
In 2001, Lipson inherited his father's pharmaceutical market research company, Rapidata.net. Within two years he helped grow the company's revenue by 500%. The company was sold to Greenfield Online in 2005 and Lipson used the profits to help fund ShareFile.[6][8]
ShareFile[edit]
Lipson built and launched ShareFile in November 2005 in Raleigh, North Carolina.[9][10] The idea stemmed from requests by several of his website design clients to provide a password-protected area for file exchange. Lipson aimed to update traditional FTP methods with ShareFile.[11]
He bootstrapped ShareFile and focused immediately on procuring only business customers. By 2011, Lipson had grown the company to 4 million users with no outside capital.[11]
In 2011, ShareFile was acquired by Citrix Systems. Lipson became vice president and general manager of Citrix Systems' newly formed data sharing product group, including ShareFile.[12] He helped inspire and oversee the expansion of a major Citrix office in downtown Raleigh’s Warehouse District, which opened in 2014.[1][10][13] As of 2016, Lipson is the corporate vice president and general manager of Citrix Cloud Services.[9]
On February 21st 2017 Lipson announced he would be leaving his position as corporate vice president and general manager of the Cloud Services Business Unit at Citrix in March 2017.
Other roles[edit]
Lipson is a founding partner of the Raleigh-based HQ Raleigh, a shared workspace.[1]
He has served on the board of directors of Yext, a startup that maintains web listings for businesses, since 2012.[14] In 2013, he started ThinkHouse, a coliving space and accelerator, for entrepreneurs.[15]
Lipson, along with his wife, spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention about entrepreneurship.[9][16]
Personal life[edit]
Lipson lives in Raleigh, NC and is married to entrepreneur Brooks Bell.[1][10]

Jesse Lipson '00 and Brooks Bell '02
 




Designs on businessWriter: Sara EngramJanuary 31, 2006  Photo: Elizabeth GaleckeAs a boy in Baltimore, Jesse Lipson '00 seemed destined to be an entrepreneur. Among other projects, he invented magic tricks and started a company to sell them to magic stores. "I had fun and made a little money," he says. "I just liked doing it."Across the continent in Alaska, Brooks Bell '02 nurtured dreams of tapping her creative talents as a graphic designer. "It was my entire identity growing up," she says.Duke nudged them in other directions--not so much off course as toward wider-ranging interests. Lipson majored in philosophy, expecting to head to graduate school and prepare for a career in academe or consulting, or perhaps go to law school. Bell, when faced with the choice between a design school with its relatively narrow curriculum and the cornucopia of courses at a liberal-arts institution, had chosen Duke. She majored in psychology.By graduation, they were both turning back toward those childhood dreams. Lipson finished a semester early, in time to catch the end of the high-tech bubble of the Nineties. He took a job with an Internet startup, working on ways to help companies add their branding to e-mail communications. But the staff was small enough that he also tried his hand at Web design. Soon, he had freelance jobs updating websites and generating online graphics.Meanwhile, at Duke, Bell signed up for an elective in graphic design, which reawakened her interest in that field. For a course project, she and Lipson designed a Christmas present for her mother--a website for her orthodontics training company. "She loved it, and said I should start a business doing it," Bell recalls.By the time Bell graduated, also a semester early, Lipson had left the startup for his own ventures. His father, a pharmacist and professor of pharmacy, had died unexpectedly in May 2001, leaving a small consulting business that sampled the effectiveness of pharmaceutical companies' advertising materials.Lipson took over the operation, later selling 65 percent to a group that agreed to run it. The company was sold in 2005 for $5.5 million, of which he and his sister split 45 percent.Lipson met Brooks during her freshman year at the bonfire celebrations after a Duke-UNC basketball game, and they quickly grew close. These days, they are partners in business and in life, running three Web-based companies from trendy office space in downtown Raleigh and looking toward marriage in August.Lipson is deep into computer programming, designing software products to automate and standardize business processes through his company, novel labs. Formerly the research arm of novelProjects, his website design, maintenance, and servicing company, novel labs was spun off into a separate company in 2004. Bell presides over Brooks Bell Interactive, a performance-oriented online-marketing firm that creates advertising and other online media for national clients.Looking back over his ventures since leaving Duke, and toward the future, Lipson says he suspects he'll qualify as a "serial entrepreneur," one who creates a company, grows it, sells it, and moves on to a new project.Once a year, he returns to Duke to speak to aspiring entrepreneurs. His favorite advice: Why wait? Freshman year is the perfect time to start a business, he says. "You have access to professors and other smart people, and you don't need to make money."— Engram is a freelance writer based in Baltimore.

Jesse Lipson
Citrix (ShareFile)
Alumni Entrepreneur






Printable Bio (PDF)
 

Interview by Howie Rhee.
If you’ve ever had to send a large file over the Internet, you probably have used ShareFile (acquired by Citrix in 2011), or a service like it. Started by Duke alumnus Jesse Lipson ’00, it is connected to some of the experiences he had while still an undergraduate at Duke University. Jesse shares some advice for students who are interested in starting their own company while in college.
Duke I&E: You had some entrepreneurial experiences while you were at Duke. What kinds of entrepreneurial things did you try as an undergraduate?
JL: When I was a freshman in 1996, we really weren’t thinking about internet businesses since e-commerce was in its very early stages. So my roommate and I experimented with a few very non-technical ideas. One business idea involved collected aluminum cans from campus and transporting them to Michigan for a 10 cent refund per can. We never really got off the ground with that one. A second idea involved trying to beat the casino by learning to time the motion of the ball on a roulette wheel. My roommate and I even traveled to Greensboro to rent a roulette wheel and bring it back to our door room to try different strategies.
Once 1999 rolled around, internet businesses were the big thing. Me and a few friends created a startup called EasyCentral. It was designed to be a personalized portal and browser toolbar that would make it easier to fill in forms on the web and to manage logins/passwords across web sites. The business never took off, but I learned a lot and in many ways that business pointed me down the path that I’m still on today.
Duke I&E: Talk us through the various startups you’ve been involved with.
JL: Aside from the startups mentioned above that I dabbled in during undergrad, my first startup was a web site development business that I started with my wife when I was less than a year out of college (she was still in college at the time). We brought a couple of other friends from Duke in as partners pretty early on. The company did pretty well but we never grew beyond about 5 total employees, and we decided to split it into three separate companies a couple of years into the business. One of those companies, Brooks Bell Interactive, is currently run by my wife. The other one, ShareFile, is my current company. The final company was sold to another web development firm a year ago.
While I was running the web development company, I also took over my father’s pharmaceutical market research company. I partnered with a couple of other Duke grads to take over the day-to-day management of that business and we eventually sold the whole business to a public company in early 2005.
Duke I&E: So you started a web development company with three friends from Duke. What lessons did you learn that’d be applicable to students that are thinking of starting a company with their friends?
JL: I think it’s important to choose one person as the clear leader of the company. Trying to make decisions with unanimous consent can really cause productivity to grind to a halt. It is also important to play out all of the “what if” scenarios, even if it forces difficult conversations. You should take into account the possibility that someone may want to leave the company, and figure out how that will impact their dividends and equity distribution.
I would advise students to watch the movies The Social Network and Startup.com. Having been exposed to many startups, both directly and indirectly, I can say that issues between business partners are very common and the more contingency planning you do ahead of time, the easier it makes things.
Duke I&E: When did you realize you could be successful as an entrepreneur (and not take a job)?
JL: I think I realized it when I was a Senior in college. Becoming exposed to a variety of businesses, I just had the (probably irrational) feeling that it would not be that hard to run a similar business and at least be moderately successful at it.
Duke I&E: You’ve talked about how students need to focus less on creating the next Google or Facebook, and more on finding a good business and executing well. What do you say to them when they say “well anybody could copy this idea”?
JL: I think that the concept of uniqueness is highly overrated when it comes to business ideas. Many aspiring entrepreneurs, especially students, feel they need to come up with a totally unique idea and if they later find someone already doing it, they give up. There is no need to be afraid of competitors as long as you have a clear path for acquiring customers and generating revenue. What you should really be afraid of is coming up with a totally new idea that no one actually wants to buy/use.
If companies copy your idea, that implies you have become successful enough to want to copy. In that case, congratulations. Now you just need to execute on your strategy to make sure you stay relevant. Don’t assume that copying a business idea is easy. If that were true, then Blockbuster wouldn’t have lost to Netflix and Google would have been able to copy Facebook before it became a $50 billion company.
Duke I&E: Tell us a little bit about ShareFile. How did it start, what do you do, and how’s it doing these days?
JL: In a nutshell, ShareFile allows companies to exchange business files that are either too large or too confidential to send by email. ShareFile spun out of my web development business. We got the idea for the product because of demand we were seeing in our service business for this type of functionality.
The company is doing great. Over the course of 5 years, we have grown from just one employee to almost 50 full-time employees and over 2 million total users across 100 countries. We are completely bootstrapped and have never raised any money.
Duke I&E: What advice do you have for students that think they want to start a company now, but are worried it’s too risky?
JL: I would say that the least risky time to start a business is while you’re in school. As a student you can work on a business without needing to make a big salary, so the downside to starting a business in college is very small. In the worst case your business will fail, but you’ll still have some great experience that will help you get a job after graduation.
Once you are married with kids and a mortgage payment, then you’ll really know what it means for it to be too risky to start a company.
Duke I&E: You have managed to have a successful company and your wife also has a successful company. Being an entrepreneur can be stressful, but you have it times two. How do you manage to balance work and life?
JL: Regarding the question about stress, I think people adapt to any situation over time. Even though I have a lot of responsibilities as a CEO, I have gotten used to those responsibilities and I’ve developed the skills to handle them, so I don’t feel stressed on a regular basis.
As for work/life balance, I didn’t have much balance for the first couple of years in my business. After a while, though, I realized that being an entrepreneur is a marathon and not a sprint. When I’m burned out, I am not creative and I don’t make good decisions. So I started working less hours and taking more vacations. I am not saying that you don’t need to work hard as an entrepreneur. I have never known anyone in any field who has accomplished something great and is not a very hard worker. But in my opinion you don’t have to work 80 hour weeks to be a successful entrepreneur.
Duke I&E: If you had to do it all over again, what would you have done differently at Duke to prepare yourself to be an entrepreneur?
JL: I would have started my first business about two years earlier than I did. Instead of starting my Senior year, I would have started my Sophomore year.
Duke I&E: If a student wants to meet you and has an idea for advice, what are you looking for from them? Is it the idea, the passion, the team?
JL: I think it’s all three of those, but the talent of the entrepreneur and their passion are definitely more important than the specific idea.
