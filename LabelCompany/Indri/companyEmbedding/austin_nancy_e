Nancy E. Austin


Obituary
Condolences




























						AUSTIN, Nancy E. Nancy E. Austin passed away peacefully on July 20, 2008 in Lake Forest, California. Born January 13, 1923 in Burlington, Iowa, daughter of Robert and Lucille Blaul; widow of Richard R. ("Dick") Austin, beloved husband of 62 years; survived by their four sons Richard, Robert, Randolph and Russell, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.   Nancy came to Southern California from Iowa with her mother in 1937, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1941. Nancy and Dick were married in 1942. Nancy will always be remembered for her steadfast love and devotion to her family and friends. Whether supporting her husband, taking care of her children and grandchildren, or caring for her elderly mother, Nancy was always there when she was needed. Affectionately known as "Nana Nancy" by the Austin family, she will be deeply missed.  Memorial services will be held on July 29, 2008 at 2:30 p.m. at the Old North Church at Forest Lawn at 6300 Forest Lawn Drive, Los Angeles, 90068; for directions, see http://www.forestlawn.com/visitors_guide/memorial_parks/glendale/index.asp  In lieu of flowers, donations may be sent to either the Alzheimer's Foundation or the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Meet Nancy

I am 62 years young and I have raised 3 sons. I have 3 young grandsons. I don't know how to calculate my experience, but I watch my grandsons a lot and I have been on Care. com for over 2 years. I regularly babysit for at least one family. I work full-time during the day, so I am available to babysit on weekends and in the evenings. I am a former kindergarten teacher with an Early Childhood Education certificate. I live in NW Austin, and would like to take jobs fairly close to me. I am considering retiring from my full-time job in the next few years, so this is a way to work my way into my retirement plan of being a part-time nanny or babysitter.




Most Recent Review




I almost don't want to write a review on Nancy, so that I can hog her all to myself. Alas, my conscience has got the better of me. She is everything a mom wants in a childcare provider and then some. I don't worry when I am gone and my kiddos are with her. I know when my oldest tells me we have to "officially" add the new babysitter to the birthday party list, that we've found a keeper :)

Child Care Experience — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I enjoy working with children and believe it to be a very rewarding experience. Children need positive role models to look up to. I had mine, and that was my older brother. I try my best to be that kind of role model for the youth I come across in life and lead by example. In terms of babysitting, I feel that interaction is key, no matter what I'm doing. If I'm cooking, I try to have the kids help out as much as possible. If they're playing with LEGO or out in the woods building forts, I'm right there with them!
I'm new to California (currently teaching here), but I ran a couple of great youth programs in Michigan. I have many years of experience with childcare, from working summer camps, tutoring, running after school programs, babysitting, mentoring, etc. I currently spend my summers running a summer camp.

Experienced Child Care Provider Who Loves Kids! — Ann Arbor, MI 
 I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in May of 2013 with a B. S. in Neuroscience. I have experience babysitting children of ages ranging from under 1-year-old to teenagers. I am comfortable assisting with cooking, cleaning, and other activities as needed. I also have a clean driving record and am happy to assist with drop-offs and pick-ups. I love animals (I grew up with Rottweilers, an English Bulldog, and I currently have a Maltepom), therefore I am extremely comfortable babysitting in a home with pets. I am available to start immediately. I have been babysitting on-and-off since I was in middle school, therefore I have 10+ years of experience.

 For the past year, I have been working with infants and toddlers in a preschool and taking care of 7-year-old twins and a new born baby, giving them Spanish Classes and being their nanny five days a week. In 2011 and 2012, I was working as an Au pair 48 hours every week in Philadelphia. I cared for a 3-year-old and a 1-year-old. It is satisfying for me to work with children because I feel happy and proud of how much they can learn, such as obedience, respect, and love for each other and good values. It makes me happy to enjoy my time with them. I like to create different fun activities like going to the library, playground, park, play dates, art lessons, Spanish lessons and cooking. At the moment I'm interested in work part time because I have my own baby and I like to spend time with her. I will work the days my husband doesn't work otherwise I would work from my home or in a different home which is willing to let me work with my baby.

 Hello! I have 14+ years of babysitting experience. I started babysitting when I was 13 years old. I started out taking babysitting classes where I became a certified babysitter and then I worked in a preschool caring for ages 0-3. My job there was to work with the 0-2 age group. When I was 15 years old, my mother had a baby who was 2.5 months premature, so not only didn't I get the chance to help raise a baby, I got neonatal experience as well, however, throughout my 11 years of babysitting, I have cared for children of all ages.
I absolutely love kids and I think they are the greatest thing. I am currently a nanny for a wonderful family going on 5 years now and another family for 6months. My time with my family of 5 years is coming to an end as the children have reached school. I do still have the other family on Mondays, Wednesday from 12-5, and Thursdays from 9-3. My families were nanny sharing meaning, we took turns at each others houses which really benefited the children environmentally and socially. I am looking to fill my Tuesdays and some time on Friday or for anyone interested in nanny sharing, as well as occasional needs.
I have worked for many families throughout Ann Arbor. If you would like to talk further and get to know me a little better, I would be happy to meet with you or talk over the phone!
I am very personable, clean, organized, outgoing, have a great time management, thoughtful/caring, flexible, and energetic. I am a good cook and a non-smoker. I have my own transportation. I am also good with pets. I can provide a clean background check. I am available for last minute needs. I have a bachelor's degree in healthcare administration.

Child Care — Austin, TX 
 I have experience in working with young infants from preemies to 15-year-olds. I was an assistant teacher at a daycare in the infant class , A two/3 yr old teacher, an assistant kindergarten teacher for a Montessori school, a Pre-K teacher, as well as a counselor for the after school YMCA. I have maintained my interest in caring for children since high school (1996) and became a nanny in 2011. The best part is, the interaction with the kids on a daily basis and having that bond. As a mother myself, soon to be a third grader, I love spending as much time I can, because before I know it he will be a teen. My CPR and First Aide are all current as well as a great driving history and background check. If you are looking for a great Nanny, I could certainly become yours. Please feel free to contact me. Thank you.
* I am currently looking to be placed with a family after June 21st, 2017.

My name is Nancy and I am a proud UT Longhorn. I am pursuing a degree in Nutrition and Public Health. I've had the opportunity to have many different jobs with kids and I have loved every single one! I have worked as a homework helper, learning center teacher, mentor, and a teacher for MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving). The kids' age range are from 1 to 10 both boys and girls. I love arts and crafts or anything that is hands-on so I will always encourage the kids to do so. I am CPR/First Aid trained and my first language is Spanish (bilingual). I am equipped with a car and I am ready to either be the mannequin to paint nails on or tough boy who can play soccer! Shoot me an e-mail and we can talk more about taking care of your kids!

Child Care — Austin, TX 
 I am certified in First Aid and CPR (I need to get it updated this year). I have 12 Early Childhood Education units. I'm an upbeat, outgoing, fun-loving, creative woman with a heart for children and a passion to help them learn and develop. I am looking for a part-time position, off no later than 2 p.m. I started babysitting when I was 12 years old and knew that I wanted to work with children when I got older. I was a preschool aide for 1 year (2005) and a preschool teacher for 3 years (2006-2009). I worked at an infant/toddler center for a year and a half (2009-2010) and after they closed down, I decided that I wanted to do a more one-on-one type of care. I have been a nanny for 5 years (2010-present) now, and I love it. I am still very close with and keep in contact with the families that I previously have worked for. In March 2015 I got married and became a bonus mom to two of the most amazing kids! My bonus kids (boy girl twins) are going to be 6 and we have them 50% of the time. I would like to have a part time job preferably T, W, Th 7-2 so I can pick them up from school on the days we have them. The days can be switched but the hours I would like to be off no later than 2. I am from Atascadero, a little town in California on the Central Coast where I have lived my entire life. I moved to Austin the beginning of 2014 and I'm loving it here! Please feel free to contact any references or get in contact with me!

Child Care Provider — Austin, TX 
 I have been babysitting and nannying for children since I was 14-years-old. I've cared for kiddos of all different ages and all different needs. I specialize in caring for children with cognitive disabilities, especially those that are on the autism spectrum. Being on the autism spectrum myself, I can relate very well to kiddos that have learning impairments of any kind, especially spectrum and sensory-processing based disabilities. On occasions when the disabled child/teen is non-verbal, I have always offered the parents--if they're interested--to teach their child and the family American Sign Language for no extra cost to my provider's fee. I am fluent in ASL--a language that changed my life as a high-functioning autistic individual. As far as being a babysitter or a nanny, while I can definitely be no-nonsense, every kiddo I've ever worked with has always laughed the entire time and begged their parent(s) to have me as a sitter again. I love every minute of my job, no question.

Child Care Provider — Austin, TX 
 I have a masters degree in Marriage and Family Therapy from St. Mary's University and a bachelors degree in psychology from Texas A&M University. I have been a babysitter for many families and nannies for two families, children ages 0-6 months. I have worked with special needs children through an organization called project sunshine and gained experience working mostly with children with down syndrome and autism. Recently, I have worked with children at the Children's Bereavement Center of South Texas to organize and facilitate support groups. I have also worked with families and children in Play Therapy settings at the Family Life Center. I have also volunteered with children who have gone through traumatic experiences ages 5 months to 17 years at the Children's Assessment Center in Houston. In 2015, I worked as a preschool teacher for children ages 3 months to 5 years. I am highly qualified and would be honored to meet and serve the needs of your family.

 I must say the true joy of my life is caring for infants and their families. Over the last 5 years I have learned so much about infant and how amazing they can be. I believe children of all ages groups need love and gentle care daily. I'm currently a college student studying Early childhood education and development. Remember our children are our future and we are the ground they grow on.

(2) 

Experienced Child Care Provider — Austin, TX 
 Caring for children has always been a passion of mine. Since the age of five, I have wanted to work in a field helping children in some aspect. I have three years of college studies towards a degree in elementary education, and I hope to return to complete the degree in the future. I have cared for children in various settings. From acting as a live-in nanny for a family of six children, to running a preschool church's nursery program. I have cared for special needs children with varied degrees of disabilities, from Autism to severe Cerebral Palsy. In high school, I was a member of FHA-HERO, an organization that promotes family values, creativity and home economics. During that time, I participated in competitive recognition events in the child development events. I love to cook, sew, take photographs, read books, tell stories, and play games.
I am currently employed full time as a special needs caregiver, and am unable to take on additional work at this time.

Kimberley M. 


(1) 

Teacher and Child Care Provider — Austin, TX 
 I have been caring for and teaching children for the last 12 years., I started teaching art at a private school that my children attended. I taught art to a variety of ages, preschool to high school, as my children grew. I became diversified with many types of schools. I especially enjoyed teaching home schooled children. I found them receptive and self-starters. I eventually started private art instructions out of my home, which was successful for six summers. I was later recruited to start as a daycare teacher. Initially, I worked with the director of the school for six months prior to opening. My responsibilities were predominately administrative. Once opened, I continued to meet with parents and recruit pupils. Once set up, I moved into the role of art teacher and also cooked the lunch program for over 100 pupils. I was with the company for three years.
The highlights in this position were working in infant care with newborns to 1-year-olds throughout the three years I was there. In spring and fall, I love to bike and take nature walks and am always scouting for a great view for a future painting. In the summer and winter I practice yoga three to four times a week. I also paint for charities, for abused children and for a breast cancer foundation. I love to travel when I can with my family and friends. So I would also be open to travel with a perspective family.

Child Care Available — Austin, TX 
 I originally started as a mother's helper in 7th grade. I have always loved children and truly take my babysitting jobs seriously. I love to get involved with the kids and build a relationship with them. Since middle school when I was a mother's helper, I have continued to babysit and this past year (my senior year of high school), I had a babysitting job everyday after school for a few hours and would help with homework, make them dinner, get them ready for sports, etc. I am currently a freshman at the University of Texas at Austin and work as a lifeguard (so I am CPR certified) and play on the water polo team. I will be home all summer from May 14 until the end of August and would love to have a babysitting job for that time being. I am a responsible, trustworthy, and outgoing individual and I look forward to hearing from you!
