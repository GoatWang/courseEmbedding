												 	Filled with the promise of adventure and glory, the Royal Navy of the Napoleonic era enticed hundreds of young men to enlist as officers in its bitter struggle against the French fleet. With some as young as nine, these boys were confronted with the harsh realities of warfare at sea: cramped conditions, ruthless storms and fierce combat. In spite of their youth, these sailors showed enormous courage and valor in the face of battle, their bravery immortalized in the literary works of Patrick O�Brian, C. S. Forester and Alexander Kent. Drawing from letters, poems and personal accounts, this book uncovers the remarkable story of those boys who fought aboard His Majesty�s mighty ships-of-the-line to defend their kingdom against the French.

Nelson v. Knight: Can a Worker Be Fired for Being Too Irresistible?



 
                    
                        
                        
                        Jon D. Bible
                    
                    
                 

About the Authors:
Jon D. Bible is a professor of business law at Texas State University-San Marcos.



In December 2012, the Iowa Supreme Court issued a controversial ruling in a sex discrimination case brought under Iowa law. In Nelson v. Knight, the court held 7–0 that a male employer may fire a female employee, though she did nothing wrong, because his wife was concerned about their relationship. Although critics maligned the decision as manifestly unfair, it is consistent with the case law. But one can envision fact patterns that might lead to a different outcome. Nelson was a stellar dental assistant for Knight for 10 years. At some point they began texting about such innocuous matters as their children’s activities. Nelson (age 32) said she saw Knight (age 53) as a father figure and never sought an intimate relationship. Knight's wife learned of the texts, however, and demanded that he fire Nelson. He did so, in part because of that demand, but also because he said he wasn't sure he could avoid trying to have an affair with her otherwise. Iowa law, on this point, is modeled after Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employers with at least 15 employees from discriminating against an employee because of his or her sex. To have a viable disparate treatment claim, a plaintiff must prove that he or she suffered an adverse employment action (e.g., termination or a promotion denial), and that sexual identity was a motivating factor in the action. A claim for disparate impact discrimination lies where an employer has a facially neutral practice that has a disproportionately negative impact on a specific gender and is not justified by business necessity. Nelson advanced a straightforward “but-for” argument: she would not have been fired but for her gender. Knight said she was fired because of the perceived threat to his marriage. Nelson countered that the threat would not have existed had she not been female. After reviewing cases holding that an employer does not violate Title VII by firing a female employee involved in a consensual relationship that has triggered jealousy, although the relationship and jealousy presumably would not have existed had the employee been male, the court upheld the district court’s decision to grant summary judgment for Knight. The ruling has been criticized on a number of grounds. One is that it sends the message that men cannot be held accountable for their sexual desires and women have to monitor and control their bosses’ urges; if these urges get out of hand, women can be legally fired. In the end, however, the court found a distinction between an isolated personnel decision based on personal relations (assuming no coercion or quid pro quo), even if the relations would not have existed had the employee been of the opposite sex, and a decision based on gender itself. The court also stressed that Knight hired Nelson and also replaced her with a woman, which indicates that sex did not motivate the termination decision. The Knight court relied on Tenge v. Phillips Modern Ag. Co., where a business owner fired a valued employee at the urging of his wife. The difference was that Tenge “came on” to the owner so there were grounds for the wife’s suspicion of an intimate relationship. Noting that sexual favoritism – treating an employee better than the opposite sex because of a consensual relationship with the boss – does not violate Title VII because any benefits of the relationship are due to the employee’s sexual conduct, not gender, the court implicitly reasoned that treating an employee unfavorably due to such a relationship is legal. In Platner v. Cash & Thomas Contractors, Inc., which was also cited, an employer fired a female employee who worked on the same crew as his son after the son’s wife became jealous of her. Concluding that the owner was faced with an escalating family conflict that he resolved by firing a non-relative instead of his son, the court found that Platner was fired, not because of her gender, but because of favoritism for a close relative. Nepotism is unfortunate, said the court, but it does not violate Title VII. All of these courts stressed, as others have, that Title VII is not a general fairness law and an employer does not violate it by treating an employee unfairly as long as he or she does not act because of the employee’s protected status. This echoes U.S. Supreme Court Justice Scalia’s admonition in a 1998 sexual harassment case that Title VII is not a general workplace civility code. It is also consistent with the approach taken in a 2010 age discrimination case, where the U.S. Supreme Court held that a plaintiff can prevail only if he or she proves that age was not just a motivating factor in his or her termination, but the sole, or but-for, cause. Nelson did not claim sexual harassment, although Knight engaged in questionable conduct, e.g., telling her that if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing, and saying, regarding her infrequent sex life, that it was like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. It may be quid pro quo, where a tangible employment action is conditioned on the granting of sexual favors, or a hostile environment, where an employee is subjected to conduct that is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of one's employment. Possibly, Nelson did not assert this claim because there was no evidence of an explicit or implicit quid pro quo or conduct that was non-consensual, unwelcome, severe, or pervasive in nature. Different facts, however, could support such a claim. The outcome might also be different if one fires several female employees because his wife was jealous of them; then, one might infer that gender, not the relationship, was the cause of the terminations. This could fit into the disparate impact category. One could also run afoul of the gender stereotyping theory, which establishes that sex discrimination occurs if an employer evaluates employees by assuming or insisting that they match the stereotype associated with their group. Recent case law is replete with examples of courts reading the “because of sex” language with increasing exactitude, largely due to the fear of making a Title VII case out of every arbitrary or unfair employment decision. The Knight case is consistent with this approach. What happened seems unfair, for had Nelson not been female Knight wouldn’t have had the feelings he had and she wouldn’t be out of a job. It is also, arguably, unsound business practice to fire a top-flight employee for the reasons Knight offered. In the end, however, the case reinforces the fact that unfair is one thing and illegally discriminatory is quite another.

			Thomas Nelson’s music business entry welcomed

Publishing giant distributes Women of Faith brand ‘to fill the void of a diminishing industry’
 
Hoping to fill a void, the world’s largest Christian book publisher has ventured into the music business. 

The May 25 releases Women of Faith Worship, Hope and Grace and Sheila Walsh’s I Hear Angels marked the first time Thomas Nelson distributed music from its conference brand. Women of Faith Worship features 10 tracks from the WoF worship team, while Hope and Grace is a compilation disc of singles from artists involved in the conferences, including Mandisa, Steven Curtis Chapman and Natalie Grant. The CDs retail for $13.99 each. 
The company purchased WoF in 2000, and has reported that the events—which also include Revolve teen conferences—comprise 20% of its annual operating budget. 
Tom Knight, Nelson’s senior vice president of Christian retail sales and ministry development group, credited the strength of a “robust” sales team—with backgrounds in publishing, retail and music—in making the decision to distribute music. 
“We understand Christian retail and … are well-qualified to help fill the void left by a diminishing music industry, especially as it relates to sales to Christian retail and independent bookstores,” he said.
Before the new recording—for which Nelson was working towards an iTunes agreement—WoF projects were distributed by Integrity Music and more recently by Word Distribution. The brand’s most recent recording—A Grand New Day, distributed by Word—was nominated for two Dove Awards this year. 
Vance Lawson, chief service officer for Nelson, said the new venture would help the company keep better control of its WoF music brand. 
“In addition to distribution, these companies also owned and controlled the records released during the distribution agreements,” he told Christian Retailing. “And they served us well. But over the last year, the Women of Faith team would like to begin creating intellectual properties that they could own and control.” 
Gospel Music Association Chairman and Daywind Music Group President Ed Leonard applauded Nelson’s move.
“It’s great whenever a big company gets involved in the music business,” said Leonard, a CBA board member. “They’ll add a lot to the music enviornment.”
The music distribution extends beyond WoF as well. Knight said the publisher is “open to discussion with labels as to sales, retail marketing and distribution” of Nelson products. < PrevNext >

looks nice but not very comfortable
















Verified Purchase


The bench has a very nice look but it is not very comfortable. The cushion also looks a bit cheap compared to the nice wood finish. I ended up putting a decorative blanket over the cushion and it looks great now.

This bench is nicely made. It would be nice if the cushion was another color besides white. I will eventually cover it. Well made and sturdy. Good value.

Delighted!
















Verified Purchase


We are extremely pleased with the bench.  It is exactly as described, reasonable in price, easy to assemble.  We wanted it for our guest room so guests had a place to sit (put shoes on, etc.) and have a place to lay things.  Couldn't be happier!

Looked at hundreds of benches to go in bedroom with antique cherry wood bedroom suite.  This would add to, but not take away from the room.  Price and measurements great.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
