This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Description
Today’s guest is the Chief Revenue Officer at Glu Mobile and he shares how to increase ad revenue for your mobile games. Also, you will discover how to use live ops to keep users engaged, the evolution of user acquisitions and what they look for in studios to acquire.
Chris Akhavan is Chief Revenue Officer at Glu Mobile.
Show Notes
The Evolution of User Acquisitions 
Chris shares that companies have become sophisticated when it comes to UA. When he joined Glu, the company didn’t actually have a way to measure the ROIs of campaigns so they were just spending blindly. They have now invested in the right infrastructure, a creative services team and talents to upgrade the quality of campaigns being deployed and be able to get ROIs down to the granular level. Now, UA and infrastructure is a continuous theme for Glu.
Growth hacking stuff employed entrepreneurs are also very relevant to big companies. Glu also spends a lot of time looking at ASO and SEO to ensure they optimize things that they put out there. They also look at other forms of marketing such as working with influencers and other non-traditional UA methods.
What They Look for in Studios to Acquire and Tips for Indie Developers
When they look for potential acquisitions, first and foremost, is talent. They find talented teams and talented creative leadership as that is the core of everything that they do.
A tip that Chris shared to indie developers is to ensure they don’t get too far ahead of themselves. The core of your games should always be fun and experience. Always get your focus back on product and get it in front of people. Focus on the game first and worry about the business execution later on. Oftentimes, some people focus too much on the business execution before they have a viable product.nti
