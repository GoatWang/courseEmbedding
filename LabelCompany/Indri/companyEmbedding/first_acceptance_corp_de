(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under the caption "Item 1A. Risk Factors."  Forward-Looking Statements  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of   the accuracy and adequacy of our loss reserving methodologies;   income, income per share and other financial performance measures;   the anticipated effects on our results of operations or financial condition from recent and expected developments or events, including the acquisition of the Titan Agencies;   the financial condition of, and other issues relating to the strength of and liquidity available to, issuers of securities held in our investment portfolio;   and our business and growth strategies.  We believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions. However, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements, or industry results to differ materially from our expectations of future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results. We discuss these and other uncertainties in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, as well as other sections, of this report.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this report. Except as otherwise required by applicable laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risk factors described in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason after the date of this report.  New York Stock Exchange Listing  Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). On October 14, 2016, we received notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards set forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which require the average closing price of our common stock to be at least $1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. On December 1, 2016, we received notice from the NYSE that the 30 trading-day average closing price of our common stock was now above $1.00 per share and that we were once again in compliance with this listing standard. We expect that our common stock will continue to be listed on the NYSE, subject to our continued compliance with all of the NYSE's continued listing standards.  General  We are principally a retailer, servicer and underwriter of non-standard personal automobile insurance. Non-standard personal automobile insurance is made available to individuals because of their inability or unwillingness to obtain standard insurance coverage due to various factors, including payment history, payment preference, and failure in the past to maintain continuous insurance coverage, driving record and/or vehicle type. On May 4, 2016, we sold a tract of land at a gain of $1.2 million and as a result have only one single tract of land in San Antonio, Texas that remains for sale.  FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K  At December 31, 2016, we leased and operated 355 retail locations (or "stores") and a call center staffed by employee-agents who primarily sell non-standard personal automobile insurance products underwritten by us as well as certain commissionable ancillary products. In most states, our employee-agents also sell a complementary insurance product providing personal property and liability coverage for renters underwritten by us. In addition, retail locations in some markets offer non-standard personal automobile insurance serviced and underwritten by other third-party insurance carriers for which we receive a commission.  Our insurance operations generate revenue from selling non-standard personal automobile insurance products and related products in 16 states. In December 2016, we closed all of our retail locations and ceased writing new business in the state of Missouri. We conduct our servicing and underwriting operations in 14 states and are licensed as an insurer in 12 additional states. After obtaining a license in California, we began selling our non-standard personal automobile insurance product there in late June 2016 on a limited basis.  At December 31, 2016, 273 of our 355 stores primarily sell non-standard personal automobile insurance products underwritten by us.  The following table shows the number of our retail locations. Retail location counts are based upon the date that a location commenced or ceased writing business. The 89 closed locations for the year included 53 that were part of our recent actions to improve profitability, 24 in the Chicago-area whose leases expired in January 2016, and 12 others closed in the normal course of business. The 4 opened locations were strategically-placed to replace and consolidate the closed Chicago-area locations.   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Retail locations - beginning of period 440 356 Opened 4 8 Acquired - 83 Closed (89) (7) Retail locations - end of period 355 440  The following table shows the number of our retail locations by state.

The magnitude and frequency of these changes are unprecedented in our recent history;   We reduced premium writings, through the closing 53 poorly performing stores, by temporarily suspending or eliminating new business in selected areas of our business, and tightening our underwriting standards;   We have taken aggressive action in our claims-handling operations where we have hired a new Senior Vice-President, restructured management and improved processes;   We increased our statutory capital and surplus by selling available-for-sale securities with unrealized gains ($4.9 million) and through capital contributions from net income derived from our insurance agency operations ($4.7 million).  Titan Acquisition  Effective July 1, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Titan Insurance Services, Inc. and Titan Auto Insurance of New Mexico, Inc. (the "Titan Agencies"). These 82 retail locations, which are now rebranded under our Acceptance Insurance name, primarily sell private passenger non-standard automobile insurance policies underwritten by unrelated insurance companies for which our revenues are in the form of commission and fee income. We currently offer our own product through these stores, on a limited basis, in California and Texas.  Consolidated Results of Operations  Overview Our primary focus is the selling, servicing and underwriting of non-standard personal automobile insurance. Our real estate and corporate segment consists of activities related to the disposition of real estate held for sale, interest expense associated with debt, and other general corporate overhead expenses. The following table presents selected financial data for our insurance operations and real estate and corporate segments (in thousands). Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Revenues: Insurance $ 388,323 $ 331,828 $ 263,133 Real estate and corporate 1,300 64 61 Consolidated total $ 389,623 $ 331,892 $ 263,194 (Loss) income before income taxes: Insurance $ (40,685) $ 338 $ 12,549 Real estate and corporate (4,445) (2,910) (2,826) Consolidated total $ (45,130) $ (2,572) $ 9,723  FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K  In 2016, our insurance operations generated revenues from selling non-standard personal automobile insurance products and related products in 17 states. We conducted our servicing and underwriting operations in 14 states through three insurance company subsidiaries: First Acceptance Insurance Company, Inc., First Acceptance Insurance Company of Georgia, Inc. and First Acceptance Insurance Company of Tennessee, Inc. Our insurance revenues were primarily generated from:   premiums earned, including policy and renewal fees, from sales of policies written and assumed by our insurance company subsidiaries;   commission and fee income, including installment fees on policies written, agency fees and commissions and fees for other ancillary products and policies sold on behalf of third-party insurance carriers; and   investment income earned on the invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries.  The following table presents gross premiums earned by state (in thousands). Driven by a 13.6% year-over-year increase in our average in-force premium at the end of each year, net premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 13.6% compared with the prior year.   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Gross premiums earned: Georgia $ 63,332 $ 51,287 $ 40,792 Florida 45,880 41,102 33,519 Texas 41,154 35,771 28,017 Ohio 30,376 26,745 22,315 Alabama 28,163 24,611 21,717 South Carolina 25,515 20,254 16,407 Illinois 20,733 24,050 20,552 Tennessee 19,330 16,702 12,748 Pennsylvania 9,618 9,224 8,426 Indiana 9,244 7,954 6,155 Missouri 5,397 5,844 4,902 Mississippi 3,872 3,398 3,030 Virginia 848 417 - California 316 - - Total gross premiums earned 303,778 267,359 218,580 Premiums ceded to reinsurer (450 ) (372 ) (265 ) Total net premiums earned $ 303,328 $ 266,987 $ 218,315  Our insurance segment presents a combined ratio as a measure of their overall underwriting profitability. The components of the combined ratio are as follows.  Loss Ratio - Loss ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned and is a basic element of underwriting profitability. We calculate this ratio based on all direct and assumed premiums earned, net of ceded reinsurance.  Expense Ratio - Expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of insurance operating expenses (including depreciation and amortization) to net premiums earned. Insurance operating expenses are reduced by commission and fee income. This is a measurement that illustrates relative management efficiency in administering our operations.  Combined Ratio - Combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. If the combined ratio is at or above 100%, our insurance segment cannot be profitable without sufficient investment income.  FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K  The following table presents the loss, expense and combined ratios for our insurance operations.   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Loss 101.9% 82.0% 73.9% Expense 14.6% 17.8% 22.7% Combined 116.5% 99.8% 96.6%  Investments  We use the services of an independent investment manager to manage our investment portfolio. The investment manager conducts, in accordance with our investment policy, all of the investment purchases and sales for our insurance company subsidiaries. Our investment policy has been established by the Investment Committee of our Board of Directors and specifically addresses overall investment goals and objectives, authorized investments, prohibited securities, restrictions on sales by the investment manager and guidelines as to asset allocation, duration and credit quality. Management and the Investment Committee meet quarterly with our investment manager to review the performance of the portfolio and compliance with our investment guidelines.  The invested assets of the insurance company subsidiaries consist substantially of marketable, investment grade debt securities, and include U.S. government securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, mutual funds, and collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"), in addition to other alternative investments made into limited partnership interests and a real estate investment trust. Investment income is comprised primarily of interest earned on these securities, net of related investment expenses. Although investments are generally purchased with the intention to hold them until maturity, realized gains and losses could occur from time to time as changes are made to our holdings based upon changes in interest rates or the credit quality of specific securities, or as we did in the recent year, to increase the statutory capital and surplus of the insurance company subsidiaries who carry fixed maturity securities at amortized cost.  The value of our consolidated available-for-sale investment portfolio was $117.2 million at December 31, 2016 and consisted of fixed maturity securities, preferred stock and investments in mutual funds, all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2016, we had gross unrealized gains of $2.4 million and gross unrealized losses of $3.1 million in our consolidated investments available-for-sale portfolio.  The value of our other investments was $10.0 million at December 31, 2016 and consisted of two limited partnership interests carried at net asset value, which approximates fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as investment income, and a privately-held real estate investment trust carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. At December 31, 2016, we had gross unrealized gains attributable to our privately-held real estate investment trust of $0.9 million in our consolidated other investments portfolio.  At December 31, 2016, 96% of the fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio was rated "investment grade" (a credit rating of AAA to BBB-) by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and have lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non-investment grade. We believe that a high quality investment portfolio is more likely to generate a stable and predictable investment return.   FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K The following table summarizes our investments available-for-sale at December 31, 2016 (in thousands). Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Fair December 31, 2016 Cost Gains Losses Value U.S. government and agencies $ 19,142 $ 112 $ (303 ) $ 18,951 Political subdivisions 4,233 - (68 ) 4,165 Revenue and assessment 5,539 185 (41 ) 5,683 Corporate bonds 47,238 107 (1,805 ) 45,540 Collateralized mortgage obligations: Agency backed 23,093 73 (744 ) 22,422 Non-agency backed - residential 2,411 529 (7 ) 2,933 Non-agency backed - commercial 1,408 487 - 1,895 Total fixed maturities, available-for-sale 103,064 1,493 (2,968 ) 101,589 Preferred stock, available-for-sale 3,025 198 (111 ) 3,112 Mutual funds, available-for-sale 11,813 698 - 12,511 $ 117,902 $ 2,389 $ (3,079 ) $ 117,212  Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015  Consolidated Results  Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased 17% to $389.6 million from $331.9 million in the prior year. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $45.1 million, compared with $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $29.3 million, compared with $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $0.71, for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $0.05 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $30.6 million of unfavorable prior period loss development. Conversely, the period was favorably impacted by a $1.2 million gain on the sale of foreclosed real estate along with net realized gains on investments of $4.8 million from the sales of fixed maturities that were sold to increase the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries. The year ended December 31, 2015 included $3.7 million of costs related to a litigation settlement.  Insurance Operations  Revenues from insurance operations were $388.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $331.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Loss before income taxes from insurance operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $40.7 million, compared with income before income taxes from insurance operations of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Premiums Earned  Premiums earned increased by $36.3 million, or 13.6%, to $303.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $267.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This improvement was due to higher average premiums resulting from our rate increases throughout the year. While during 2016, our total policies-in-force declined 14.5%, this targeted decline was more than offset by a 13.6% year-over-year increase in our average in-force premium.  Commission and Fee Income  Commission and fee income increased by $15.7 million, or 26%, to $75.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from $59.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Revenue from the former Titan retail locations acquired on July 1, 2015 accounted for the majority of this increase. The remaining increase in commission and fee income was a result of higher fee income related to commissionable ancillary products sold through our previously-existing retail locations.  FIRST ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION 10-K  Investment Income  Investment income decreased slightly to $4.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 from $5.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease in investment income was primarily a result of the lower returns on reinvested fixed maturities. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the book yields for our fixed maturities and cash equivalents portfolio were 1.5% and 2.3%, respectively, with effective durations of 2.52 and 3.04 years, respectively.  In September 2016, in order to increase the statutory capital and surplus of our insurance company subsidiaries by realizing gains on fixed maturities carried at amortized cost for statutory purposes, we sold $66.9 million of available-for-sale securities yielding 3.6% and reinvested the proceeds at 2.2%. As a result, our investment income in future periods will decline from the reduced yield in our fixed maturities portfolio.  Net Realized Gains on Investments, Available-for-Sale  Net realized gains on investments, available-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.8 million from the previously-mentioned sale of fixed maturities. Net realized gains are net of $147 thousand of charges related to other-than-temporary-impairment ("OTTI") on a mutual fund and other net realized gains from redemptions.  Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  The loss ratio was 101.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 82.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We experienced unfavorable development related to prior fiscal years of $30.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with unfavorable development of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The unfavorable loss development for the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of increased losses primarily from the 2015 accident year across all major coverages. The most significant causes of the development were a greater than usual emergence of reported claims and higher bodily injury severity. The unfavorable loss development for the year ending December 31, 2015 was largely the result of an increase in bodily injury loss adjustment expenses (primarily outside legal costs) driven by the overall increase in claim frequency.  Excluding the development related to prior fiscal years, the loss ratios for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 91.8% and 81.7%, respectively. The year-over-year increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to higher than expected claim frequency across all major coverages and higher bodily injury severity. We believe that an increase in the number of miles driven by insured drivers as a result of lower gas prices and a favorable economy, along with an increase in distracted driving has been a contributing factor to an industry-wide increase in frequency. In response, the Company has continued to implement aggressive rate and underwriting actions as warranted at a state and coverage level and strengthen its claims organization and processes. These rate actions, as well as changes in coverage mix, the number of vehicles and vehicle type insured, have resulted in a 13.6% year-over-year increase in our average in-force premium.  Insurance Operating Expenses  Insurance operating expenses increased 10.6% to $116.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $105.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily due to the addition of the former Titan retail locations which were not acquired until July 1, 2015.  During the six months ended December 31, 2016, we closed 55 poorly-performing stores. The cost of these closures, primarily for lease buyouts, was $1.0 million and is included in insurance operating expenses.  The expense ratio was 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 17.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to the increase in premiums earned which resulted in a lower percentage of fixed expenses in our retail operations (such as rent) and the Company's efforts on cost containment.  Overall, the combined ratio increased to 116.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016 from 99.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Benefit for Income Taxes  . . .
