Ally Bridge Group Expands Global Healthcare Investing With Six New Medtech Investments in China and the US

Jun 10, 2015, 10:00 ET
		  		  							
						 from   Ally Bridge Group 











 
















































 

 




















 


HONG KONG, June 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ally Bridge Group ("ABG"), a leading China-global cross-border healthcare-focused investment group - which announced a USD3.3 billion proposed take-private offering for Wuxi Pharmatech (NYSE:   WX) on April 30, 2015 - is pleased to announce that it has completed six new investments in medical technology companies based in China and the U.S. Each of these companies has the opportunity to redefine the standard of care for its respective treatment segment, and ABG is proud to support their efforts with its unique China-global cross-border strategies.
Among these six companies, two have already begun generating healthy financial returns in a short period of time. These two companies include (1) China-based Wing Tai Holdings Ltd. (HKSE: 876), which became the only Chinese dental implants and devices platform listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May 2015, and (2) U.S.-based EndoChoice (NYSE:   GI), a rapidly-growing provider of innovative gastro-intestinal (GI) products, which successfully completed its initial public offering on June 5, 2015; ABG invested in both the Series E financing in March 2015 and in the IPO for EndoChoice.
Four other medtech investments include:

NxThera, Inc. - a company that has developed an innovative, outpatient water vapor debulking procedure for BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia); the technology has been approved in Europe with a CE Mark and is now awaiting U.S. FDA approval. 
Neuroverse, Inc. - a neurotechnology company developing integrative brain assessment solutions for both healthcare and everyday life applications. 
Conventus Orthopedics - an orthopedics manufacturer that has developed a novel, minimally invasive implant solution for extremity fracture management. 
Shockwave Medical - a company that has developed a first-in-kind lithoplasty (lithotripsy) system designed to address calcification in arterial vessels and coronary heart valves.
"Ally Bridge Group continues to invest in truly disruptive medtech companies globally as well as leading local platforms in China, and adds value by driving cross-border market access and partnerships," said Frank Yu, ABG's Founder, CEO and CIO. "We pioneered this value-add cross-border investment strategy in 2011, when we invested in LifeTech Scientific (HKSE: 1302), a China-based medtech company, and then helped the company cement a landmark partnership with Medtronic, which has generated exceptional investment returns. We have executed multiple successful value-add investments since and remain uniquely positioned to help U.S. and European portfolio companies with outbound strategies to Asia. Simultaneously, we help leading Chinese healthcare platforms access innovative technologies globally. This unique strategy has been a critical driver of the outstanding returns generated by our healthcare investments across ABG's funds and affiliates."
More on ABG's Recent MedTech Investments
Wing Tai Holdings Ltd. (Shenzhen, China; soon to be re-named Mega Medical Technology Ltd.) is a leading Chinese manufacturer of restorative and prosthetic dental products, including dentures, veneers, crowns, and bridges. The company (HKSE: 876) is the first Chinese dental company to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, following the acquisition of Royal Dental Labs in May 2015.
EndoChoice (Atlanta, GA, U.S.; www.endochoice.com) is a medtech company focused on the manufacturing and commercialization of platform technologies including endoscopic imaging systems, devices and infection control products and pathology services for specialists screening, diagnosing and treating a wide range of gastrointestinal conditions, including colon cancer. EndoChoice leverages its direct sales organization to serve more than 2,500 customers in the United States and works with distribution partners in 25 countries. The Company was founded in 2008 and has developed a broad and innovative product portfolio, which includes the Full Spectrum Endoscopy System (Fuse®). EndoChoice completed its successful initial public offering (IPO) on June 5, 2015 (NYSE:   GI).
NxThera, Inc. (Maple Grove, MN, U.S.; www.nxthera.com) has pioneered the application of its Convective Water Vapor Energy (WAVE™) technology platform in a variety of endourologic conditions beginning with BPH, and including prostate and kidney cancer. NxThera's Rezūm System uses sterile water vapor, or steam, to convectively deliver targeted, precise thermal treatments to men suffering from BPH in a simple, minimally invasive procedure designed to take only minutes, done in an office, outpatient or hospital setting, with minimal discomfort, and provide improvements in symptoms, urinary flow and quality of life.
Neuroverse, Inc. (San Diego, CA, U.S.; www.neuroverse.com) is a neurotechnology company dedicated to developing mental and neural assessment multi-use solutions. Bringing a novel integrative brain interface platform, its technology allows for mobile and easy-to-use applications spanning from mental health (http://www.neuroverseinc.com/schizophrenia-research-prize/) to education and entertainment (http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/marvel-comics-gets-inside-the-heads-of-the-avengers1/).
Conventus Orthopedics, Inc. (Maple Grove, MN, U.S.; www.conventusortho.com) is advancing a novel minimally invasive, extremity fracture implant platform. The company is commercializing their FDA and CE Mark-approved implants for both shoulder and wrist fractures. Conventus was founded by a team of medical device professionals and physicians with the sole purpose of improving patient care by creating a platform technology with less invasive solutions to a broad range of challenging peri-articular fractures. Taking its name from the Latin word for coming together or union, Conventus Orthopaedics is focused on creating less invasive solutions for fractures in and around the joints.
Shockwave Medical (Fremont, CA, U.S.; www.shockwavemedical.com) is pioneering Lithoplasty® technology, a promising breakthrough for the treatment of peripheral and coronary vascular disease and aortic stenosis. Delivered on a standard balloon catheter platform, Lithoplasty combines the calcium disrupting power of lithotripsy with the familiarity and simplicity of a balloon in a single enabling device. 
About Ally Bridge Group Ally Bridge Group ("ABG"), founded and led by Frank Yu, is a global healthcare-focused investment platform. Recently ABG has added Internet investing to its strategy. ABG and its affiliates manage over $1 billion in assets with a global investment portfolio in China, the U.S., and Europe. ABG has expertise in cementing strategic partnerships between emerging healthcare companies and industry leaders, and across different geographies, particularly between the U.S. and China.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Ally Bridge Group Expands Global Biopharmaceutical Investments

						 from   Ally Bridge Group 











 
















































 

 




















 


HONG KONG and SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ally Bridge Group ("ABG"), a global healthcare-focused investment platform, has expanded its global biopharmaceutical portfolio with several recent investments in first-in-class therapeutics companies based in China, the United States and Europe. ABG will work closely with these companies by taking active board of directors and/or scientific advisory board positions. 
In China, ABG led the recently completed financing for Hua Medicine (www.huamedicine.com), a Shanghai-based clinical-stage therapeutics company developing an oral small-molecule drug for Type II diabetes. Importantly, Hua has identified specific biomarkers and will use them to select patients. In 2015 Hua will begin its Phase II clinical trial in China under the Green Channel Status (comparable to the Fast Track Status of the U.S. FDA), and will also begin a U.S. Phase I clinical trial. There are more than 100 million diabetics in China, where locally-developed innovative drugs are greatly needed in order to address the massive and growing diabetes-related medical needs of the Chinese population. 
In the U.S., ABG completed investments in: 1) 3-V Biosciences (www.3vbio.com), an oncology drug development company based in Menlo Park, California, targeting fatty acid synthase  (FASN) in various solid tumors; 2) Symic Biomedical (www.symicbio.com), a company based in San Francisco developing a novel category of therapeutics treating osteoarthritis and vascular diseases; 3) Alzheon (www.alzheon.com), a Boston-based clinical-stage therapeutics company developing a first-in-class treatment for Alzheimer's disease, which represents ABG's first neurology therapeutics investment; 4) ImmunGene (www.immungene.com), an existing ABG portfolio company based Thousand Oaks, California, which has developed a unique empowered antibody therapeutics technology platform based on antibody-interferon fusion molecules. 
In Europe, ABG invested in Pieris Pharmaceuticals (www.pieris.com), a Munich-based, clinical-stage, multi-specific antibody drug delivery technology platform that has partnered with several global biopharmaceutical companies, and which was recently listed in the U.S. 
"Ally Bridge Group, while continuing to build out its oncology, especially immuno-oncology, portfolio in both the U.S. and Europe, has also established strategic footholds in other large therapeutic areas, such as diabetes, neurology and inflammation. All of these investments, together with our existing specialty-pharma portfolio in the U.S., have strengthened and diversified ABG's global biopharmaceutical reach," said Frank Yu, ABG's Founder, CEO and CIO. "With our roots in Asia, and our investments in the U.S. and Europe, we are becoming a truly global healthcare investment platform that differentiates itself by enabling partnerships between emerging healthcare companies and industry leaders, and by acting as a bridge between China and the U.S.  We are very pleased to work hand-in-hand with a number of top-tier healthcare funds in the U.S. and leading industry partners."

China Fund Slashes ADR Exposure, Boosts Holdings of A-Shares

                Noah’s Gopher China equity fund cuts exposure to ADRs
            



                Fund also adds tactical traders in preparation for volatility
            



Start your day with what's moving markets in Asia. Sign up here to receive our newsletter.Noah Holdings Ltd., which manages the best-performing emerging markets fund of hedge funds, has cut China-related American depository receipts by about one-third this year after shares surged, while adding to yuan-denominated shares listed on the mainland.The $73 million Gopher China Equity Selection Fund cut ADRs after a rally led by a few large stocks, William Ma, co-chief investment officer of the Chinese wealth manager’s Hong Kong unit, said in an interview. Since the second-quarter, the fund has been boosting investments in so-called A-shares, which are comparatively cheap and have higher expected profit growth than U.S.-listed counterparts, said Ma.








"We worry that the U.S. market momentum is too concentrated. It’s sentiment driven," said Ma, who is also co-CIO of Noah’s alternative investment arm Gopher Asset Management.A rally in Chinese stocks listed in the U.S. has been led by companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which surged 75 percent from a December low, and live-streaming video company Momo Inc., whose shares more than doubled this year. Hedge funds have piled into Chinese ADR stocks that have also been bought by index-tracking funds, which raises the specter of exaggerated sell-offs and losses when markets turn risk-averse.“When there is a lot of profit sitting in people’s portfolio, when there is a slight macro risk, people will just run and go,” Ma said.The money manager expects A-shares to get a boost from MSCI Inc.’s decision to include the nation’s stocks in its indexes for the first time. The move has prompted interest from U.S. and European pension funds, said Ma.The Gopher fund, started in July 2013 to meet investment demand from wealthy Chinese with assets offshore, returned more than 17 percent this year through June by farming out money to Greater China-focused stock funds, said Paul Gan, its lead manager. Barclays Plc ranked it the best emerging markets fund of hedge funds in the three years to May 2017, with annualized returns of nearly 17 percent.




The fund invests in about 10 managers focused on China, said Ma. Its return in the first half was driven by gains in U.S.-listed Chinese technology and education stocks, a surge in Hong Kong shares in the first quarter and the recovery of China A-shares that began in the second quarter, said Gan.The Gopher fund’s net exposure to U.S. ADRs has declined to just above 10 percent, from a near historical high of about 20 percent at the start of the year, said Gan.As it boosts holdings in A-shares in China, where shortselling is restricted by regulations, the fund had chosen some low-fee, long-biased funds, said Ma. The Gopher fund has also increased allocations to short-term traders who can weather better temporary volatility in the wake of the rallies, he added.

The Gopher fund has been adding in recent years specialists that focus on specific industries, such as Ally Bridge LB Healthcare Fund, as they can offer benchmark-beating returns or “alpha,” Ma said. Led by former Merck & Co. scientist and Morgan Stanley head of Greater China healthcare research Li Bin, the Ally fund returned nearly 12 percent in the first half of this year and 43 percent since its inception two years ago, according to an investor update.Gopher Asset Management, Noah’s Shanghai-based alternative investment arm which also counts private-equity firm Sequioa Capital as a stakeholder, oversaw $18.8 billion at the end of the first quarter in funds that allocate to private equity, real estate and hedge funds.
