At Hartford Funds, we believe in human-centric investing — understanding the reasons why investors do what they do. So we’re not surprised that with all the enthusiasm for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), your clients may be missing an important fact: traditional passive ETFs can come with unintended risks.That’s why all Hartford Funds Multifactor ETFs are designed with an approach we call intentional risk allocation. A strategy that can help your clients feel smarter while working to reach their long-term life goals.

Not All Multifactor ETFs Are Created Equal

The way you allocate risk is one of the most important factors of investment success. With Hartford Funds Multifactor ETFs, we place risk and growth potential at the forefront of our index design. Our goal: Take "better" risk in pursuit of growth by allocating toward the risks we believe are more likely to generate returns.

An Example of Taking “Better” Risk
It’s important to address the problems that cap-weighted indices face. That’s why we actively weigh country exposures to limit concentration risk. It’s just one of the actions we take when building the customized indices for our ETFs.
Improved Diversification





Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. For illustrative purposes only.

A Word About Risk
 Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. These risks are generally greater for investments in emerging markets. Small cap securities can have greater risk and volatility than large-cap securities. A concentration in real estate securities, such as REITs, may subject a fund to risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate as well as the risks related to the way real estate companies are organized and operated. Real estate is sensitive to changes in interest rates and general and local economic conditions and developments. A non-diversified fund may be more exposed to the risks associated with single issuers than a diversified fund. There is no assurance that the investment process will consistently lead to successful investing. Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. RORE is new and has limited operating history.

Value
 Is Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 

 It is not possible to calculate the future cash flow value for Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF. This is due to cash flow or dividend data being unavailable. The share price is $15.522.



PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.

Value checks

Is the discounted cash flow value less than 20%, or 40% of the share price? (2 checks) (Click here or on bar chart for details of DCF calculation.)

Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF has a total score of 0/6, see the detailed checks below.

Discounted cash flow (Dividend Discount Model)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF is arrived at by discounting future dividends to their present value. This approach is used for finance firms where free cash flow is difficult to estimate (e.g. Banks/ Insurance firms).
If the firm does not pay the majority of its earnings out as a dividend this method will often arrive at a value significantly lower than the share price.
See our documentation to learn about this calculation.

Value of the stock
Value = Expected dividends per share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual growth rate)
$0 = ($0 / (10.55% - 2.33%)
Value per share: $0
Current discount (share price of $15.522): %

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 10.55% = 2.33% + (1.072 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered is used in the case of financial firms, but it is not adjusted for financial leverage like with non-finance firms. Therefore the average levered beta from comparable firms is used as the bottom-up beta. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Average Levered Beta from peers = 1.072
Levered Beta used in calculation = 1.072

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is Lattice Strategies Trust - Hartford Multifactor REIT ETF expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 0 analysts?

 Insufficient estimate data, unable to calculate 1 year growth expectation.

The consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”) will result in a change of control of the Advisor and, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), an automatic termination of (1) the investment advisory agreement, dated December 30, 2014, between the Advisor and the Trust, on behalf of each Fund (the “Current Advisory Agreement”) and (2) the investment sub-advisory agreement, dated December 31, 2014, between the Advisor and Mellon Capital Management Corporation (the “Sub-Advisor”) with respect to each Fund (the “Current Sub-Advisory Agreement”).In order to ensure that each of the Funds is provided with continuous investment advisory and sub-advisory services after the Closing, at a meeting held on June 10, 2016, the Board, including all of the Trustees that are not “interested persons” (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) (“Independent Trustees”), unanimously approved a new investment advisory agreement and a new investment sub-advisory agreement, effective if and when the Closing transpires. Under current law, the new advisory agreement and new sub-advisory agreement are required to be submitted to Fund shareholders for their approval.The terms of the new advisory agreement will be substantially similar to the Current Advisory Agreement. Under the new advisory agreement, the Advisor will continue to serve as the investment adviser providing investment management services to the Funds and there will not be any changes to the contractual fee paid by each Fund under the agreement. The terms of the new sub-advisory agreement will be substantially identical to the Current Sub-Advisory Agreement and there will not be any changes to the contractual fee paid by the Advisor to the Sub-Adviser under the agreement.In addition, at the meeting held on June 10, 2016, the Board also approved, subject to approval of shareholders, (1) certain amendments to the Declaration of Trust and (2) a so-called “manager of managers” arrangement, which would permit the Funds and the Advisor to enter into and/or materially amend agreements with sub-advisers that are affiliated or unaffiliated with the Advisor, in each case with the approval of the Board of Trustees and without obtaining approval from the applicable Fund’s shareholders.A proxy statement containing detailed information regarding the proposals is expected to be mailed to shareholders of record in early July 2016. The shareholder meeting is expected to be held on or about July 25, 2016.Investors Should Retain This Supplement for Future Reference
