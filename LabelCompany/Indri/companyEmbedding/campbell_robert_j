Overview



Campbell's Psychiatric Dictionary is widely recognized as the definitive dictionary of psychiatry--up-to-date, comprehensive, and authoritative. Distinguished by its clarity and scholarship, it is unique among dictionaries in providing nearly encyclopedic discussions of many of the most important entries. The Ninth Edition is nearly double the size of the previous edition and has been updated, revised, and vastly expanded to cover the explosion of new words and terms in psychiatry (including terms reflective of the debate now informing the development of the DSM-V ), neuroscience, cognitive and clinical psychology, and neurodegenerative diseases as well as relevant terms and concepts from a wide range of related fields, including genetics, imaging, general medicine, forensic psychiatry, and sociology. It also covers the full range of treatments, including psychopharmacologic agents, behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, interpersonal therapy, and other brief therapies. The entries are clearly written, so that they can be understood by non-psychiatrists (including general readers), and they feature cross-references, so that readers can easily locate all the relevant information on a topic. Campbell's is written for the working library of a broad and diverse readership of specialists and non-specialists that includes psychiatrists, residents, neurologists, psychologists, nurses, social workers, counselors, lawyers, claims reviewers, and lay readers with an interest in mental health issues.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Robert E. Campbell
 






 





                    MBA '62        





Vice Chairman; Johnson & Johnson




Bio: 



Robert E. Campbell spent 40 years at Johnson & Johnson before retiring in 1995 as vice chairman. He earned his MBA from Rutgers on a part-time basis while rising through the ranks at J&J. He held various positions in financial management and systems planning, and was named treasurer and a director in 1976. In succeeding years, his responsibilities continued to increase, and, in 1985, he was appointed vice chairman. Under his watch, the company introduced major professional medical devices including disposable contact lenses, endo surgery instruments and cardio-vascular stents. Campbell helped J&J grow from a $240 million dollar domestic company that focused primarily on consumer products to a $30 billion dollar international corporation focused on pharmaceuticals and professional devices.
Recognized: June 19, 2002

But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Millbrook, NY professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

What is a general contractor?General, or construction contractors, are often known as project managers. They oversee the entire remodeling or new home construction project and facilitate all day-to-day tasks that move it toward completion. A Millbrook general building contractor will work with your architect to review plan as you build a house and ensure everything is in place before work is started as well as arrange for permits and necessary inspections. While good local home improvement contractors in Millbrook will have the skills to handle certain tasks onsite, such as carpentry, he or she is also responsible for hiring subcontractors for the majority of jobs, such as electrical work, painting or plumbing. In addition, the general contractor should be on-site regularly to inspect the progress and resolve issues. Here are some related professionals and vendors to complement the work of general contractors: Architects & Building Designers, Interior Designers & Decorators, Landscape Architects & Landscape Designers, Kitchen & Bath Designers, Specialty Contractors.Home remodeling contractors are a must for successful completion of a renovation. Because of this, it's essential that you do your homework before deciding on the right general contractor in Millbrook as you remodel or build a house. Inspect bids carefully. Was it ready when the contractor promised it? Was the bid for building a home unusually high or low? Each of these things can be very telling: A late bid may reflect timing standards, and an off-the-mark bid could be code for a pricey premium or a deliberate underbid to score the remodeling job. You should call references, carefully read reviews and visit completed projects in Millbrook, NY to see if they’re what you expect for your job. Once you do secure your local Millbrook contractors, read the contract very carefully to be sure everyone is on the same page.Questions to ask prospective Millbrook general contractors: How long have you been in the business? How many projects like mine have you completed? Who will be working on the project? What qualities do you look for in your subcontractors? Can you provide me with references? Are you licensed and insured? How do you charge, and what does that include? What happens when costs exceed budget, whether due to materials or labor pricing changes? What about changes made by the client or by the professionals — what kinds of situations would cause those costs to be incurred? Can you give me a written estimate? What do your services include? When can your job get done? What will I need to provide? Are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this project?Find a Millbrook contractor on Houzz.
