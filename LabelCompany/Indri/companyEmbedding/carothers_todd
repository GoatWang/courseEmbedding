Every August Todd and his family look forward to their summer vacation on Torch Lake, MI. Todd's extended family has been vacationing on Torch Lake since 1950.The Carothers' family cements their place in Chicago at Wrigley Field.Todd and family enjoying downtown Chicago during the holidays.




Todd Carothers
Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing

It is very rare that have a market window where demand and product offerings come together at the same time. I believe CounterPath is at the beginning of a significant marketing opportunity that will grow according to service providers' requirements to compete against Internet OTT players such as Skype, Viber, Google Voice and others.
