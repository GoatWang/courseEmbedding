“Michael Nauman is known and respected as a hands-on leader who thrives on attacking challenges, building customer relationships and driving product innovation,” said Conrad Goodkind, the Lead Independent Director of Brady’s Board. “His strong operational and financial background and experience in managing and growing diverse products and businesses throughout the world make him the ideal person to lead our business into the future.”
Nauman replaces Thomas J. Felmer, who will return to his previous position as senior vice president and chief financial officer.
Nauman joins Brady after 20 years in a number of senior management positions at Lisle, Illinois-based Molex Incorporated. For the past five years, he was Molex’s Executive Vice President and President of the Global Integrated Products Division, where he led six global business units in the automotive, datacom, industrial, medical, military/aerospace and mobile markets. Under Nauman’s leadership, the Global Integrated Products Division grew to 12,000 employees at 26 locations in 13 countries with $1.2 billion in annual sales.
