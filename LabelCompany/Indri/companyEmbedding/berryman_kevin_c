 PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (NYSE:JEC) announced today that Kevin
      Berryman is joining the company as Executive Vice President (EVP) and
      Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Mr. Berryman, who brings 33 years of
      finance leadership in global publicly traded companies, will assume his
      new role effective January 5, 2015.
    

      Mr. Berryman will oversee all aspects of corporate finance including
      accounting, investor relations, mergers and acquisitions, global supply
      management, and real estate functions. He will report to the President
      and Chief Executive Officer, Craig Martin.
    

      For the past five years Mr. Berryman has served as EVP and CFO at
      International Flavors and Fragrances Inc., an S&P 500 company and
      leading global creator of flavors and fragrances used in a wide variety
      of consumer products. Prior to that, he spent 25 years at Nestlé in a
      number of finance roles including treasury, mergers & acquisitions,
      strategic planning, and control. Recent roles at Nestlé included Senior
      Vice President and Controller of the Nestlé Group, and CFO of Nestlé
      Purina, where he supported the integration of Nestlé’s largest
      acquisition, Ralston Purina, into the Nestlé operations.
    

      In making the announcement, Jacobs President and Chief Executive Officer
      Craig Martin stated, “I am particularly pleased to have an executive of
      Kevin’s caliber joining our company and senior management team. Kevin
      has a strong international background and well-demonstrated leadership
      abilities in finance, business operations, sales, and strategic decision
      making. We look forward to benefitting from his expertise and fresh
      perspective on our business.”
    

      In September, Jacobs announced the planned retirement of its EVP Finance
      and Administration John Prosser, who has been with the company for 40
      years. Mr. Prosser will continue at Jacobs until the end of January 2015
      to work with Mr. Berryman on the transition of his role, and then plans
      to remain available as needed. Craig Martin went on to say, “John has
      done an extraordinary job in his 30 years as our CFO. I am confident
      Kevin can build and expand upon John’s legacy.”
    

      Jacobs is one of the world's largest and most diverse providers of
      technical professional and construction services.

183 B.R. 463 (1995)
In re BERRYMAN PRODUCTS, INC., Debtor.
BERRYMAN PRODUCTS, INC., Appellant,
v.
NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY, Appellee.
No. 4:95-CV-055-A.
United States District Court, N.D. Texas, Fort Worth Division.
June 16, 1995.
*464 *465 Jeffrey Philipp Prostok, Kevin C. Norton, Cantey & Hanger, Fort Worth, TX, Craig Howard Averch, Jones Day Reavis & Pogue, Los Angeles, CA, for Berryman Products, Inc.
Andrew Hailey Roberts, Zelle & Larson, Dallas, TX, for Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co.

MEMORANDUM OPINION and ORDER
McBRYDE, District Judge.
This action comes before the court as an appeal from orders of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth Division, the Honorable Massie Tillman presiding. The court, having reviewed the briefs of appellant, Berryman Products, Inc.,[1] and appellee, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, the record on appeal, and applicable authorities, finds that the orders from which appeal is taken should be reversed and that the motion seeking authority to institute certain causes of action should be denied.

I.

Jurisdiction
The appeal is from an amended order signed and entered on October 5, 1994,[2] authorizing appellee to institute certain causes of action on behalf of the debtor in Case No. 493-41086-MT-11, and from an order signed and entered December 14, 1994, denying appellant's motion for rehearing. The court's jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 158(a).
Appellee argues that the October 5, 1994, order is not final for purposes of appeal. To be considered final, the order sought to be appealed must conclusively determine substantive rights of the parties. Texas Extrusion Corp. v. Lockheed Corp. (In re Texas Extrusion Corp.), 844 F.2d 1142, 1155 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 926, 109 S. Ct. 311, 102 L. Ed. 2d 330 (1988). Finality for the purpose of appellate jurisdiction is viewed more flexibly in the context of bankruptcy cases than in ordinary civil proceedings. Louisiana World Exposition, Inc. v. Federal Ins. Co. (In re Louisiana World Exposition, Inc.), 832 F.2d 1391, 1395-96 (5th Cir.1987). The court is satisfied that the orders from which appeal is taken dispose of a discreet dispute within the larger bankruptcy case and are, therefore, final for purposes of appeal. Even if the orders were not final, the court would grant an interlocutory appeal in this action. The court is satisfied that a controlling issue of law is involved; that the issue is one where there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion; and that immediate appeal will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. Ichinose v. Homer Nat'l Bank (In re Ichinose), 946 F.2d 1169, 1177 (5th Cir.1991).

II.

Pertinent Facts and Underlying Proceedings
On March 18, 1993, Berryman Products, Inc., filed a voluntary petition under Chapter *466 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The bankrupt entity is hereinafter referred to as the "debtor." The petition was filed following entry of a $7.5 million dollar judgment against debtor and a co-defendant in favor of Matt Hart in Cause No. 90 DRO 207, styled "Matt V. Hart, plaintiff v. Sean Grimes, Berryman Products, Inc., and C.P. Hunt Company, Inc., defendants" in the Superior Court of California, County of Humboldt. Appellee is the liability insurer of debtor's co-defendant in the California action. Appellee and its insured claim that they are entitled to complete indemnity by debtor.[3]
On June 7, 1994, appellee filed a motion, amended on July 1, 1994, in the bankruptcy court seeking authority to institute certain causes of action on behalf of debtor. Specifically, appellee sought leave to pursue causes of action against R.H. Blankenship, former sole shareholder of debtor, for fraudulent transfers, preferential liens, and unauthorized post-petition payments, and against officers and directors of debtor and its parent company for violations of restrictions on corporate distributions. The claims appellee sought leave to pursue are hereinafter referred to as the "avoidance action."
On July 29, 1994, the bankruptcy court approved debtor's plan of reorganization. Thereafter, on August 30, 1994, the bankruptcy court heard appellee's motion and granted the same by order entered September 14, 1994, as amended on October 5, 1994. On September 23, 1994, appellant filed a motion for rehearing. That motion was heard on December 5, 1994, and, on December 14, 1994, the bankruptcy court signed an order denying the motion.

III.

Issues on Appeal
Appellant raises five issues on appeal. First, the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to grant appellee authority to institute the avoidance action. Second, the bankruptcy court erred in granting appellee's motion because the confirmed plan of reorganization specifically vested the avoidance action exclusively in appellant. Third, the bankruptcy court erred in finding that appellee established the existence of a colorable claim. Fourth, the bankruptcy court erred in finding that debtor unjustifiably refused to pursue the avoidance action. And, fifth, the bankruptcy court erred in failing to consider the potential recovery and costs of pursuing the avoidance action.

IV.

Standard of Review
To the extent the appeal presents questions of law, the bankruptcy court's judgment is subject to de novo review. Pierson & Gaylen v. Creel & Atwood (In re Consolidated Bancshares, Inc.), 785 F.2d 1249, 1252 (5th Cir.1986). Findings of fact, however, will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority v. Braniff Airways, Inc. (In re Braniff Airways, Inc.), 783 F.2d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir.1986). A finding is clearly erroneous, although there is evidence to support it, when the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Id. The mere fact that this court would have weighed the evidence differently if sitting as the trier of fact is not sufficient to set aside the bankruptcy court's order if that court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety. Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S. Ct. 1504, 1511-12, 84 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1985).

V.

Whether the Bankruptcy Court Lacked Jurisdiction
Appellant first contends that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction after *467 confirming the plan of reorganization to consider appellee's motion to institute the avoidance action. Appellant maintains that after confirmation the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction to do only the things set forth in the plan and nothing more.[4]See A.R.E. Mfg. Co. v. United States (In re A.R.E. Mfg. Co.), 138 B.R. 996, 999 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.1992).
The better analysis is set forth in Harstad v. First American Bank (In re Harstad), 155 B.R. 500 (Bankr.D.Minn.1993), aff'd, 1994 WL 526013 (D.Minn.), aff'd, 39 F.3d 898 (8th Cir.1994). The bankruptcy court is not divested of jurisdiction upon confirmation. Eubanks v. Esenjay Petroleum Corp., 152 B.R. 459, 464 (E.D.La.1993); National Convenience Stores, Inc. v. Shields (In re Schepps Food Stores, Inc.), 160 B.R. 792 (Bankr.S.D.Tex.1993). The parties by agreement cannot expand or limit a court's jurisdiction. Harstad, 155 B.R. at 507. Therefore, the first issue is without merit.

VI.

Whether the Right to Bring the Avoidance Action was Vested Exclusively in Appellant
Appellant next contends that the bankruptcy court erred in allowing appellee to pursue the avoidance action because the granting of such authority in effect amended the plan of reorganization. The court agrees. Pursuant to the plan, appellant retained the right to bring the avoidance action. A plan is a contract between a debtor and its creditors. Baldwin Technology Corp. v. Dahlgren Int'l, Inc. (In re Dahlgren Int'l, Inc.), 147 B.R. 393, 398 (N.D.Tex.1992). Moreover, a confirmed plan has the effect of a final judgment. Id., at 397. If the plan is confirmed, all questions that could have been raised are foreclosed by res judicata. Christopher v. American Universal Ins. Group, Inc. (In re Christopher), 148 B.R. 832, 837 (Bankr.N.D.Tex.1992), aff'd, 28 F.3d 512 (5th Cir.1994). If appellee was not satisfied with, or questioned, that part of the plan regarding maintenance of causes of action, it should have raised the issue at plan confirmation or on direct appeal from the plan confirmation order. Republic Supply Co. v. Shoaf, 815 F.2d 1046, 1049-50 (5th Cir.1987).
The bankruptcy court had no power to grant the motion, because the plan did not authorize it to take away rights reserved to appellant and, in effect, reassign those rights to appellee. The court further notes that, since the estate ceased to exist upon plan confirmation, the bankruptcy court's order appears to be inappropriate for the further reason that it authorized appellee to bring the avoidance action on behalf of the debtor, an entity that no longer existed.

VII.

Whether Appellee Met its Burden of Proof at the Hearing
Even assuming that the bankruptcy court properly could have amended the plan on appellee's motion, appellant maintains that appellee did not demonstrate the existence of a colorable claim and debtor's unjustifiable refusal to pursue such claim. (These are presented as the third and fourth issues on appeal. The fifth issue is a subpart of the fourth.) The bankruptcy court's findings of a colorable claim and unjustifiable refusal to pursue same are subject to review on a clearly erroneous basis. The bankruptcy court's application of the law is subject to de novo review.
Appellee acknowledged at the hearing on its motion that it had the burden of proof. However, appellee did not adduce any evidence and, therefore, could not have met *468 its burden. Even assuming that the exhibits referred to during the hearing had been admitted as evidence, they would not have supported the finding of a colorable claim.[5] Further, the exhibits are not pertinent to the issue of debtor's unjustifiable refusal to pursue an avoidance action. For these additional reasons, appellant is entitled to reversal of the orders from which it appeals.

VIII.

Order
The court ORDERS that the orders of the United States Bankruptcy court from which appeal is taken be, and are hereby, reversed, and that the motion seeking authority to institute certain causes of action be, and is hereby, denied.
NOTES
[1]  Appellant is the reorganized debtor, that is, the surviving entity after plan confirmation.
[2]  The court notes that the order reflects that it was agreed to by the parties. The court suspects that the agreement was as to form only and that had appellant's counsel signed the order himself, he would have noted the apparent error.
[3]  The judgment of the trial court in the California action has now been reversed. The reversal does not significantly impact this appeal. Although existence of the judgment is conceivably relevant to appellant's fourth issue on appeal, for the reasons discussed infra, that issue is not dispositive of the appeal. The court has allowed the appellate record to be supplemented with a copy of the opinion of the California appellate court for whatever value it may have.
[4]  Appellee contends that this issue was not raised before the bankruptcy court and should not be considered on appeal. The issue was raised for the first time in appellant's motion for rehearing. The bankruptcy court ruled that the point had been waived. See First United Financial Corp. v. Specialty Oil Co., 5 F.3d 944, 948 n. 9 (5th Cir.1993) (indicating that an issue raised posttrial is properly raised on appeal if the district court has exercised its discretion to consider the issue). But see Butler Aviation Int'l, Inc. v. Whyte (In re Fairchild Aircraft Corp.), 6 F.3d 1119, 1128 (5th Cir.1993) (indicating that an issue need only be raised in such a manner as to give the trial court an opportunity to rule on it). In any event, a purely legal issue may be raised for the first time on appeal and this issue would seem to fit into that category. First United, 5 F.3d at 948.

United States Court of Appeals,Fifth Circuit.
IN RE: BERRYMAN PRODUCTS, INC., Debtor. NATIONWIDE MUTUAL INSURANCE COMPANY;  Matt Van Hart, Appellants, v. BERRYMAN PRODUCTS, INC.;  Berryman Products of Delaware, Inc., Appellees.
No. 98-10046
    Decided: November 18, 1998

		Before WIENER, BARKSDALE and EMILIO M. GARZA, Circuit Judges.James C. Gordon,Boswell & Kober, Fort Worth, TX, Andrew Hailey Roberts, Zelle & Larson, Dallas, TX, for Appellants. Jeff Philipp Prostok, Kevin C. Norton, Cantey & Hanger, Fort Worth, TX, for Appellees. Craig Howard Averch, Neligan & Averch, Dallas, TX, for Berryman Products of Delaware, Inc.
This appeal arises from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding of Berryman Products, Inc. and Berryman Products of Delaware, Inc. (“Berryman” or “the Debtor”).1  Appellants Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and Matt Van Hart (collectively “Nationwide”) appeal the district court's grant of the Debtor's motion to dismiss Nationwide's appeal of plan confirmation on the ground of mootness.   Based on the facts before us, we conclude that the merits of the appeal are moot and therefore, dismiss the appeal.I.FACTS AND PROCEEDINGSIn March of 1993, the Debtor voluntarily filed for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the “Code”) as a result of being cast in judgment for $7.5 million in a products liability suit.   That case arose from an accident that occurred in California on which Matt Van Hart (“Hart”) sued Berryman and others alleging that he sustained injuries in a car that had been serviced with brake cleaner manufactured by Berryman (the “Hart Lawsuit”).   Among others, Hart also sued the distributor of the brake cleaner, C.P. Hunt Company (“Hunt”).   After a jury trial, the California court found Berryman and Hunt jointly and severally liable for $7.5 million, being 80% of the damages sustained by Hart.At the time of the accident, Berryman was insured by Corporate Underwriters, Ltd., which failed to indemnify Berryman for losses it suffered by virtue of the Hart judgment.   The specter of this judgment motivated Berryman to file voluntarily for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Code. Hunt, the party jointly and severally liable with Berryman for the Hart judgment, was insured by Nationwide, which then settled with Hart. Nationwide agreed to pay Hart $6 million in exchange for a release from liability and the authority to pursue claims in Hart's name.One month after Nationwide settled with Hart, Berryman filed suit against its own risk manager and Nationwide (the “Berryman Lawsuit”), alleging negligence, breach of express and implied contracts and warranties, breach of fiduciary duties, and negligent misrepresentation in connection with their conduct during the Hart Lawsuit.   Additionally, Berryman appealed the verdict in the Hart Lawsuit, which was eventually reversed for trial errors and remanded in early 1995 for a new trial.2  Both the Hart and Berryman Lawsuits are still pending.At the onset of the Berryman bankruptcy proceeding, Nationwide, on behalf of Hunt, filed a proof of claim for $6 million, the amount paid on the personal injury/products liability claim.   On the recommendation of Berryman, the court estimated Nationwide's claim to be $6 million for purposes of voting and evaluating the feasibility of a plan;  resolution of the Hart and Berryman Lawsuits was not predicted to occur until three to five years after plan confirmation.   Hart too filed a claim for the remaining $1.5 million of the net $7.5 million personal injury judgment.3 The Debtor's Reorganization Plan (the “Plan”) was structured to assure repayment of 100% of the present value of the claims through issuance of interest-bearing, fifteen year notes for the $6 million and $1.5 million, respectively.   As state court litigation was ongoing, the term of the notes was set to commence on entry of final orders resolving all contested matters in the Hart and Berryman Lawsuits.   In other words, in an effort to avoid undue delay in the administration of the Plan, Nationwide's claims were characterized as contingent and unliquidated.4  Nationwide objected to the Plan on various grounds and was the only class of creditors to vote against it.   The bankruptcy court held a two-day hearing to evaluate the Plan and contemplate Nationwide's objections, ultimately confirming the Plan in July, 1994.The next month, Nationwide sought a stay from the bankruptcy court to prevent the Plan's execution and appealed the bankruptcy court's order of confirmation to the district court.   The bankruptcy court denied the stay on the merits, and Nationwide appealed its request for a stay to the district court.   Citing the failure to follow Bankruptcy Rule 8005,5 the district court likewise denied the stay.   Nationwide neither filed an amended request to correct the deficiencies noted by the district court nor appealed the denial of the stay to this court.   In the absence of a stay to prevent execution of the Plan, the Debtor commenced implementation by paying its creditors (with the exception of the Nationwide claims, which were contingent).As noted, Nationwide had also appealed the bankruptcy court's order confirming the Plan to the district court.   Arguing that this appeal was moot, the Debtor filed a motion to dismiss, which was followed by an exchange of response and reply memos.   More than a year after the appeal of plan confirmation was filed-in January, 1996-Nationwide requested a hearing on the matter, which the district court denied.   Although it eventually set a hearing in December, 1997, the district court ultimately canceled the hearing and granted the Debtor's motion, finding the appeal moot and inequitable.   The district court focused on (1) Nationwide's failure to obtain or diligently seek a stay of the Plan, (2) the Plan's resulting implementation, and (3) the inevitable prejudice that the Debtor would incur from a reversal.   Nationwide timely filed this appeal.II.ANALYSISA. Standard of Review In the bankruptcy appellate process, we perform the same function as did the district court:  Fact findings of the bankruptcy court are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard and issues of law are reviewed de novo.6 B. Applicable LawNationwide contests the district court's dismissal of its appeal challenging confirmation of the Plan. Nationwide urges us to reverse the order of dismissal and reach the merits of the appeal, contending that the mootness analysis applied by the district court was flawed.   Nationwide focuses on the district court's finding that reversal of the Plan would disrupt trade relationships and jeopardize the Plan's economic core.   Instead, Nationwide asserts, the Debtor, in its exclusive discretion, could choose to forego repayment from its creditors, thereby maintaining the status of the Plan and precluding a finding of mootness. The standard for mootness in the bankruptcy context differs from a constitutional mootness analysis.  Article III of the United States Constitution requires an inquiry into whether a live case or controversy exists;  in contrast, reviewing courts considering bankruptcy appeals such as the one now before us seek to determine whether implementation of the reorganization plan has progressed to a point at which fundamental changes in the plan would jeopardize its success.7  Stated differently, we may decline to consider the merits of confirmation when a plan has been so substantially consummated that effective judicial relief is no longer available-even though the parties may have a viable dispute on appeal.8  Historically, when evaluating dismissal of challenges to reorganization plans in a bankruptcy case as moot, we have looked to see whether (1) a stay has been obtained, (2) the plan has been substantially consummated, and (3) the relief requested would affect either the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the plan.9  Nationwide argues that in this case each of the elements is lacking in some respect;  accordingly, we now evaluate each in turn.1. Failure to obtain a stay The first question in a mootness inquiry is whether the appellants secured a stay to prevent execution of the Plan. As correctly noted by the Debtor, the requirement of a stay encapsulates the fundamental bankruptcy policy of reliance on the finality of confirmation orders by the bankruptcy court.10  Nationwide asserts that because it diligently pursued a stay, its failure to obtain the stay does not require dismissal of the proceeding as moot.11  We rejected this argument in In re Manges.12  In response to a similar argument, we cited with approval a Seventh Circuit opinion that stated, “[a] stay not sought, and a stay sought and denied, lead equally to the implementation of the plan of reorganization.” 13  In Manges we recognized that a reviewing court's decision not to grant a stay is often dispositive of a mootness challenge on appeal, but that provisions of the Bankruptcy Code “preordain” such a consequence.14 In this case, Nationwide unsuccessfully petitioned both the bankruptcy and district courts to obtain a stay, yet failed to appeal the stay to this court or to amend its motion in the district court to comply with procedural inadequacies.   In the absence of a stay, the Plan became effective and was implemented over the course of four years.   Consistent with our Manges opinion, we conclude that even though Nationwide sought a stay-pursued with a marked lack of diligence, we might add-the stay was denied and the Plan was largely implemented.   Consideration of this factor thus militates in favor of dismissal for mootness.2. Substantial consummation of the PlanThe second question in the mootness inquiry is whether the Plan has been substantially consummated, which the Code defines as:  (a) transfer of substantially all property the plan proposes to transfer;  (b) the debtor's assumption of the business or management of substantially all property dealt with by the plan;  and (c) commencement of distribution under the plan.15  At this time-more than four years after the effective date of the Plan-the Debtor has repaid $1.37 million in trade debt and has retired $2.15 million in secured debt owed to an insider of the company;  the allowed claims has been effectively repaid in full.16  Nationwide argues that because distributions have never commenced on its $6 million claim, the plan cannot have been substantially consummated.   Nationwide attempts to characterize its claim as non-contingent and liquidated because the bankruptcy court, in an estimation proceeding, recognized the indemnity obligation owed to Nationwide by the Debtor.   Nationwide supports its argument by attempting to distinguish its right to indemnity from the personal injury judgment in the Hart Lawsuit, insisting that its indemnity claim is not contingent on the outcome of the Hart Lawsuit appeal.   We disagree.   The judgment in the Hart Lawsuit was partially satisfied by Nationwide, which sought indemnity for its payment.   This payment, however, is the basis of the Debtor's claim against Nationwide on grounds of breach of warranty and fiduciary duties (the Berryman Lawsuit).   Consequently, the indemnity obligation owed by the Debtor to Nationwide is directly contingent on the outcome of both the Hart and Berryman Lawsuits.Furthermore, the bankruptcy court estimated the value of Nationwide's claim at $6 million solely for voting and feasibility purposes-not for allowance.   Nationwide's claim will not become an “allowed” claim until the conclusion of all the state court litigation.   At the present time, the Debtor has fulfilled all obligations allowed under the Plan, thereby resulting in its substantial consummation.17  We find Nationwide's arguments unavailing and conclude that the second factor in this analysis weighs in favor of dismissal as moot.3. Effect on parties not before the courtThe final question in the mootness inquiry is whether the requested relief would affect the rights of parties not before the court or the success of the Plan. Nationwide assures us that it does not seek piecemeal revision or amendment of the Plan, but requests reversal of Plan confirmation in its entirety.   In seeking reversal of confirmation, Nationwide contends that the Debtor need not restore distributions made under the Plan, citing § 549 of the Code to support this proposition.   Nationwide's argument, however, has no applicability in this context.   Section 549 provides, in pertinent part:  “[T]he trustee may avoid a transfer of property of the estate ․ that is not authorized by this title or by the court.” 18  Under this section, a two year statute of limitations is placed on recovery of such post-petition transfers unauthorized by the Code.19 In contrast to the situation addressed in § 549, the Plan expressly authorized the payments made by the Debtor in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code.   Section 549 does not address Nationwide's argument, and Nationwide does not cite any authority for the proposition that, in reversing the Plan, the Debtor can forgo repayment from creditors.   To the contrary, we remain satisfied that reversal of the Plan means exactly that-placing the parties in the status quo pre-confirmation.20 Unraveling the Plan at this time clearly would affect the position of trade creditors who granted concessions to the Debtor under the reorganization.   In fact, trade creditors reinstated favorable pre-bankruptcy terms to the Debtor in exchange for full satisfaction of their claims.   The restored terms fueled the success of the reorganization and allowed the Debtor to pass savings on to its customers.   Reversal of these payments would frustrate creditor relations and the emergence of the Debtor as a viable going concern in the economy.21  We are satisfied that, like the first two factors, this third one weighs against interfering with the Plan after the passage of some four years.III.CONCLUSIONThe district court properly granted the Debtor's motion to dismiss because Nationwide's appeal met the test for mootness.   Nationwide did not secure or diligently pursue a stay to prevent execution of the Plan, as a result of which the Plan was substantially consummated.   The Debtor has extinguished 100% of the obligations provided for in the Plan, with the exception of the Nationwide claims, which presumably will be allowed when all state court litigation is finally resolved.   Returning the Debtor to the pre-confirmation status quo now would undermine the success of the Plan and jeopardize critical trade relations of the Debtor.   For the forgoing reasons, we decline to reach the merits of the Plan, and we dismiss the appeal of confirmation order as moot.APPEAL DISMISSED.FOOTNOTES1.   The briefs filed in this appeal reference a single Debtor, “Berryman Products, Inc.,” but the appellees are listed as “Berryman Products, Inc. and Berryman Products of Delaware, Inc.” We refer to a single Debtor throughout the opinion, but to the extent that both Berryman Products, Inc. and Berryman Products of Delaware, Inc. are affected, the term Debtor in the singular references both entities.2.   Unlike Berryman, Nationwide did not appeal the verdict in the Hart Lawsuit.3.   During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceeding and the Hart Lawsuit appeal, Matt Van Hart died and all claims in his name have subsequently inured to his estate.4.   See 11 U.S.C. § 502(c) (1994);  Bankr.R. 3018(a) (providing for the estimation of claims for purposes of voting to accept or reject a plan).5.   Bankruptcy Rule 8005 provides that a motion for stay pending appeal made to the district court must show why the relief was not obtained from the bankruptcy judge.   Bankr.R. 8005.   The district court found that “appellant in no way indicates the reasons for the bankruptcy judge's denial of its request for a stay.”   The district court further noted that notwithstanding the procedural deficiency, appellants failed to make the necessary showing that they were entitled to a stay pending appeal.6.   Matter of Crowell, 138 F.3d 1031, 1033 (5th Cir.1998);  Matter of U.S. Abatement Corp., 79 F.3d 393, 397 (5th Cir.1996);  In re Block Shim Dev. Co.-Irving, 939 F.2d 289, 291 (5th Cir.1991).   Nationwide urges this court to adopt a plenary standard of review because the district court on appeal did not have access to the entire bankruptcy court record.   In our review, we are not limited to the record examined by the district court, but refuse to adopt a plenary standard of review as it applies to issues of fact.   As we have repeatedly held, findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.   See Block Shim, 939 F.2d at 291 (in evaluating dismissal of a case as moot, the court “reviews factual findings of the district court using a clearly erroneous standard in light of the entire record.”).7.   In re Manges, 29 F.3d 1034, 1038-39 (5th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1152, 115 S.Ct. 1105, 130 L.Ed.2d 1071 (1995).8.   Id. at 1039;  see also In re Andreuccetti, 975 F.2d 413, 418 (7th Cir.1992);  In re Crystal Oil Co., 854 F.2d 79, 82 (5th Cir.1988);  In re Roberts Farms, Inc., 652 F.2d 793, 798 (9th Cir.1981).9.   Manges, 29 F.3d at 1039;  Block Shim, 939 F.2d at 291.10.   See In re Public Serv. Co., 963 F.2d 469, 471-72 (1st Cir.) (“the equitable component [to the mootness doctrine] centers on the important public policy favoring orderly reorganization and settlement of debtor estates”), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 908, 113 S.Ct. 304, 121 L.Ed.2d 226 (1992);  In re Information Dialogues, Inc., 662 F.2d 475, 476-77 (8th Cir.1981) (“[T]he mootness doctrine promotes an important policy of bankruptcy law-that court-appointed reorganizations be able to go forward in reliance on such approval unless a stay has been obtained.”).11.   Nationwide cites In re Federated Dept. Stores, Inc., 44 F.3d 1310 (6th Cir.1995) and Matter of 203 LaSalle St. Partnership, 126 F.3d 955 (7th Cir.1997), cert. granted, 523 U.S. 1106, 118 S.Ct. 1674, 140 L.Ed.2d 812 (1998), to support its proposition.   In our view, however, neither of these cases provide guidance.  Federated involved the appointment of a financial advisor, which the court termed a “collateral consequence” to reorganization, 44 F.3d at 1315-16, and 203 Lasalle St. involved the reversal of a bankruptcy plan because innocent third parties were unharmed.  126 F.3d at 961.12.   29 F.3d at 1039-40.13.   Manges, 29 F.3d at 1040, quoting In re UNR Indus., Inc., 20 F.3d 766, 769-70 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 999, 115 S.Ct. 509, 130 L.Ed.2d 416 (1994).14.   Manges, 29 F.3d at 1040 (citing to sections of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules that prohibit reversal or modification of unstayed bankruptcy orders).15.   11 U.S.C. § 1101(2)(1994).16.   The district concluded that substantial consummation had occurred based on 150 distributions to trade creditors totaling $337,000.   Subsequent to the briefings in the district court, the Debtor made additional payments under the Plan. We evaluate all payments made by the Debtor at the time this appeal, which includes these additional payments.   See Manges, 29 F.3d at 1041 (“[T]his court may review evidence as to subsequent events not before the courts below which bears upon the issue of mootness.”)17.   See Block Shim, 939 F.2d at 291 (finding substantial consummation under the Code because “Block Shim and its creditors have completed every transfer contemplated by the plan.”).18.   11 U.S.C. § 549(a) (1994).19.   Id. (emphasis added).   The Debtor in this case would be outside of the two year limit.20.   See e.g. Manges, 29 F.3d at 1043 (doubting that the status quo as it existed before the confirmation order could be attained if the court unraveled the Plan);  Miami Ctr. Ltd. Partnership v. Bank of New York, 838 F.2d 1547, 1557 (11th Cir.1988) (holding that it would be legally and practically impossible to restore the status quo before confirmation), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 823, 109 S.Ct. 69, 102 L.Ed.2d 46 (1988).21.   See Crystal Oil, 854 F.2d at 81 (“loss of this plan would disrupt a very successful organization”).WIENER, Circuit Judge:
