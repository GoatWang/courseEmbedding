We expect to receive approximately $    million of net proceeds (assuming the
midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) from the
sale of the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fully repay
our $65.0 million term loan and the outstanding indebtedness under our revolving
credit facility and the remaining net proceeds to fund our 2016, 2017 and 2018
capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. The following table
illustrates our anticipated use of the net proceeds from this offering:

Our term loan matures on April 15, 2018. Interest on the term loan is LIBOR plus
5.25%. At March 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on our term loan
was 5.69%. As of June 30, 2016, we had $     million of outstanding borrowings
and $0.5 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit
facility. Our revolving credit facility matures October 15, 2019 and bears
interest at a variable rate. At March, 31, 2016, the weighted average interest
rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.44%. We also pay a
commitment fee on unused amounts of our revolving credit facility ranging from
37.5 basis points to 50 basis points, depending on the percentage of the
borrowing base utilized. The outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility were incurred to fund a portion of our 2014, 2015 and 2016 capital
expenditures. We may at any time reborrow amounts repaid under our revolving
credit facility, and we expect to do so in the future to fund our capital
program.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$    per share would cause the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses,
received by us to increase or decrease, respectively, by approximately
$    million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. If the proceeds increase due to
a higher initial public offering price, we would use the additional net proceeds
to fund our 2016, 2017 and 2018 capital expenditures or for general corporate
purposes. If the proceeds decrease due to a lower initial public offering price,
then we would first reduce by a corresponding amount the net proceeds directed
to general corporate purposes and then, if necessary, the net proceeds directed
to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.


The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with
other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only
explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and
refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional,
national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for
productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to
define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and
prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these
companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during
periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated
competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to,
federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which
would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire
additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent
upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate
transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have
fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may
be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and
natural gas properties.

There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other
industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be
substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation
considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the
jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of
any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its
effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially
increase the costs of developing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay
the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors
may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state
and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely
affect our competitive position.


Company Description
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the development and
acquisition of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas
reserves in the Permian Basin. Our assets are concentrated in the Delaware
Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. Our properties consist of


 large,
contiguous acreage blocks in Reeves, Ward and Pecos counties in West Texas.

As of June 15, 2016, our portfolio included 61 operated producing horizontal
wells. Our horizontal wells span an area approximately 45 miles long by 20 miles
wide where we have established commercial production in five distinct zones: the
3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, Upper Wolfcamp A, Lower Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and
Wolfcamp C. As a result, we have broadly appraised our acreage across various
geographic areas and stratigraphic zones, which we expect will allow us to
efficiently develop our drilling inventory with a focus on maximizing returns to
our stockholders. In addition, we believe our acreage may be prospective for the
2nd and 3rd Bone Spring shales and Avalon Shale, where other operators have
experienced drilling success near our acreage.

We have leased or acquired approximately 42,500 net acres, approximately 83% of
which we operate, as of June 15, 2016. Our acreage is predominantly located in
the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, where production and reserves
typically contain a higher percentage of oil and natural gas liquids and a
correspondingly lower percentage of natural gas compared to the northern portion
of the Delaware Basin. After temporarily suspending drilling activity at the end
of March 2016 to preserve capital, we added one horizontal rig in June 2016 and
expect to add a second horizontal rig in the fourth quarter of 2016. During
2015, we operated, on average, one rig and placed 13 horizontal wells on
production. Our development drilling plan is comprised exclusively of horizontal
drilling with an ongoing focus on reducing drilling times, optimizing
completions and reducing costs.

The Permian Basin is an attractive operating area due to its extensive original
oil-in-place, favorable operating environment, multiple horizontal zones, high
oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, well-developed network of oilfield
service providers, long-lived reserves with relatively consistent reservoir
quality and historically high drilling success rates. According to the Energy
Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy (the “EIA”), the
Permian Basin is the most prolific oil producing area in the United States,
accounting for 23% and 20% of total U.S. crude oil production during the
twelve-month periods ended April 30, 2016 and April 30, 2015, respectively.

Over the past decade, the Delaware Basin has experienced significant horizontal
drilling. According to Baker Hughes, three of the top six Permian Basin counties
by horizontal rig count are located in the Delaware Basin. Reeves County, where
the majority of our acreage is located, had the second most horizontal rigs of
any U.S. county as of June 17, 2016, with 21 rigs as of such date. As a result
of this horizontal drilling, the Delaware Basin is the only region in the United
States that has experienced sustained fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter
production growth rates greater than 25% for the past three years.

Source: IHS Performance Evaluator as of April 2016.
  
Based on recent well results and significant decreases in drilling and
completion costs, we believe the Delaware Basin represents one of the most
attractive operating regions in the United States. According to data from IHS
Performance Evaluator, in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, wells in the Delaware Basin
had a higher average three-month cumulative initial production per 1,000 feet of
lateral section than wells in the Midland Basin, another sub-basin of the 
Permian Basin. These results are driven primarily by the over-pressured nature
of the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp reservoirs in the Delaware Basin, which enhances
the deliverability of horizontal wells. We believe these results indicate the
Wolfcamp and the Bone Spring formations in the Delaware Basin generate greater
implied EURs per 1,000 feet of lateral length as compared to the Spraberry and
Wolfcamp zones in the Midland Basin.

We were formed by an affiliate of Natural Gas Partners (“NGP”), a family of
energy-focused private equity investments funds. Our goal is to build a premier
development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling in the
Delaware Basin. Our key management and technical team members average
approximately 28 years of experience and have successfully led development
operations in prolific oil basins in the Continental United States, including
horizontal development in the Permian, Bakken and Niobrara plays. This expertise
and technical acumen have been applied to the horizontal drilling and
multi-stage completions on our properties, resulting in drilling success and
continuous operating improvements across multiple zones.

We have assembled a multi-year inventory of horizontal drilling projects. As of
June 15, 2016, we had identified 1,357 gross horizontal drilling locations in
the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, Upper Wolfcamp A, Lower Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B
and Wolfcamp C zones across our Delaware Basin acreage based on spacing of four
wells per 640-acre section in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone and five to six
wells per 640-acre section in the Wolfcamp zones. Our drilling inventory
includes 366 extended lateral locations of either 9,500 or 7,500 lateral feet.
Our near-term drilling program is focused on both the Upper and Lower Wolfcamp A
zones, but we also intend to drill locations in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone,
Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp C zones. Based on our and other operators’ well results
and our analysis of geologic and engineering data, we believe the 2nd and 3rd 
Bone Spring shales and Avalon Shale may also be prospective across our acreage,
and we may integrate these zones into our future drilling program as they become
further delineated. The following table provides a summary of our gross
horizontal drilling locations by zone as of June 15, 2016.

                    Total Horizontal Locations(3)(4)     1,357  

(1) Our total identified horizontal drilling locations include 51 locations      
    associated with proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2015. We have 
    estimated our drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions and upon  
    the evaluation of our horizontal drilling results and those of other         
    operators in our area, combined with our interpretation of available 
    geologic and engineering data. In particular, we have analyzed and 
    interpreted well results and other data acquired through our participation 
    in the drilling of vertical wells that have penetrated our horizontal zones. 
    In addition, to evaluate the prospectivity of our horizontal acreage, we 
    have performed open-hole and mud log evaluations, core analysis and drill 
    cuttings analysis. The drilling locations that we actually drill will depend 
    on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, 
    costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities we 
    are able to conduct on these identified locations may not be successful and 
    may not result in our ability to add additional proved reserves to our 
    existing proved reserves. Further, to the extent the drilling locations are 
    associated with acreage that expires, we would lose our right to develop the 
    related locations.                                                             

(2) Our horizontal drilling location count implies 880-foot spacing with five to 
    six wells per 640-acre section in the Wolfcamp zones and 1,320-foot spacing  
    with four wells per 640-acre section in the 3rd Bone Spring Sandstone, in    
    each case, consisting primarily of single-section (i.e., approximately       
    4,500-foot) laterals.                                                        

(3) 674 of our 1,357 horizontal drilling locations are on acreage that we        
    operate. We have an approximate 82% average working interest in our operated 
    acreage.                                                                     

(4) We have included undeveloped horizontal locations only on our leasehold in   
    Reeves and Ward counties.                                                    

We believe that development drilling of our 1,357 gross horizontal locations,
with an increasing focus on drilling extended lateral wells as well as potential
downspacing, will allow us to grow our production and reserves. In addition, we
believe our large acreage blocks allow us to optimize our horizontal development
program to maximize our resource recovery and our returns. We also intend to
grow our production and reserves through acquisitions that meet our strategic
and financial objectives. Furthermore, we believe our operational efficiency is
enhanced by a third-party gas gathering system and cryogenic processing plant,
which were built specifically for the area where the majority of our acreage is
located, and our operated saltwater disposal system.

In addition, a third-party crude gathering system, which is expected to be
operational in the third quarter of 2016 and which will transport the majority
of our crude oil to market at a lower cost than we have experienced
historically, will provide additional efficiencies.

We experienced a significant decrease in our drilling and completion costs
during 2015, which has continued into 2016. This trend has been driven by
efficiency improvements in the field, including reduced drilling days, the
modification of well designs and reduction or elimination of unnecessary costs.
Additionally, overall service costs have declined as a result of reduced
industry demand. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, the spud-to-rig
release for our three single-section horizontal wells was approximately 22 days
compared to 28 days and 46 days for all single-section horizontal wells we
drilled in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that further optimization in
the field (including the increased drilling of longer laterals, pad drilling,
the use of shared facilities and zipper fracs), reduced rig rates and lower
service costs will improve our well economics.

Our 2016 capital budget for drilling, completion and recompletion activities and
facilities costs is approximately $87 million, excluding leasing and other
acquisitions. We expect to allocate approximately $72 million of our 2016
capital budget for the drilling and completion of operated wells and $8 million
for our participation in the drilling and completion of non-operated wells. For
2016, we have budgeted $25 million for leasing. In the three months ended
March 31, 2016, we incurred capital costs of approximately $16.5 million,
excluding leasing and acquisition costs.

Because we operate approximately 83% of our net acreage, the amount and timing
of these capital expenditures are largely subject to our discretion. We believe
our approximate 82% average working interest in our operated acreage provides us
with flexibility to manage our drilling program and optimize our returns and
profitability. We could choose to defer a portion of our planned capital
expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including the success of our
drilling activities; prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, natural gas and
NGLs; the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital; the
receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals; drilling,
completion and acquisition costs; and the level of participation by other
working interest owners. We have an approximate 15% working interest in our
non-operated acreage.

For the three months ended March 31, 2016, our average net daily production was
7,212 Boe/d (approximately 71.7% oil, 17.7% natural gas and 10.6% NGLs). The
following table provides summary information regarding our proved reserves as of
December 31, 2015, based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell &
Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent petroleum engineer. Of our proved
reserves, approximately 40% were classified as proved developed producing
(“PDP”). Proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) included in this estimate are from
52 horizontal well locations across three zones.

HOUSTON, July 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Silver Run Acquisition Corporation ("Silver Run") (NASDAQ:   SRAQ, SRAQU, SRAQW) today announced that, subject to certain conditions, including approval of the Silver Run stockholders, it has agreed to acquire a controlling interest in Centennial Resource Production, LLC ("Centennial"), an independent oil and natural gas company located in the core of the Southern Delaware Basin. On July 6, 2016, an affiliate of Riverstone Holdings LLC ("Riverstone") entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial from funds controlled by, and affiliates of, NGP Energy Capital Management, L.L.C. (together, "NGP"). In accordance with the definitive agreement, Riverstone has agreed to assign, and Silver Run has agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial to Silver Run and will participate in the transaction as an equity holder directly in Silver Run.  








In connection with the assignment of Riverstone's rights under the definitive agreement and the acquisition of the Centennial interest by Silver Run, Riverstone and certain Riverstone controlled investment funds will purchase an estimated $810 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share, including up to $175 million from Riverstone Energy Limited. In addition, certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company will purchase $200 million of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share. The proceeds of both stock sales will be used to fund a portion of the cash consideration required to effect the Centennial acquisition. Following the closing of the Centennial acquisition and related transactions, Riverstone and such affiliates will be the single largest stockholder of Silver Run, with an approximate 51% ownership interest. NGP is expected to retain a significant equity stake in Centennial, approximating 11% of the outstanding interests, and will have a representative on the Silver Run Board of Directors.
Mark Papa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Silver Run, will lead Centennial following the consummation of the transaction. Centennial's existing senior management team led by Chief Executive Officer Ward Polzin, will provide transition services for a period of time as Mr. Papa looks to permanently fill key management positions. Mr. Papa commented, "Since our IPO, we have been searching to acquire a meaningful position in one of North America's premier oil shale basins. There has been a lot of recent excitement about the Delaware Basin, but we believe its potential is still significantly underappreciated. Centennial has an enviable position in the Delaware's southern oil-rich core. I want to commend Ward and his team for assembling such a top-notch set of assets and organization. I look forward to replicating the culture and philosophy that made EOG Resources such a success during my time there and using the Centennial assets as a platform to build something truly special."
The anticipated initial enterprise value of the combined company is approximately $1,735 million, implying a multiple of 12.6x and 6.6x projected calendar 2017 and 2018 adjusted EBITDA, respectively, and post-closing equity value of $1,835 million at $10.00 per share. Silver Run expects to be debt-free at the closing of the transaction and have $100 million of cash-on-hand and an undrawn revolving credit facility to fund future drilling and acquisitions. At consummation of the transaction, Silver Run is expected to be renamed Centennial Resource Development Corp. and trade on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol "CDEV".
Centennial Highlights

Pure-play core Delaware Basin company 
­42,500 net acres primarily in Reeves and Ward counties 
­Approximately 7,200 boe/d of net production 
­48.6 MMboe of net proved reserves as of June 2016 based on internal estimates 
­Stacked pay consisting of 5 currently producing shale zones with upside for 7 more 
­1,357 gross identified potential horizontal drilling locations 
­Among the best performers in the Southern Delaware Basin based on production per lateral foot
Transaction Details
On July 6, 2016, Riverstone entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate 89% interest in Centennial. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, Riverstone retained the ability to assign its rights and obligations to purchase the interest in Centennial to Silver Run. On July 22, 2016, Riverstone agreed to assign, and Silver Run agreed to assume, its right to purchase the interest in Centennial, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the approval of the transaction by Silver Run's stockholders.  
In connection with the transaction, Silver Run intends to obtain equity financing through the private placement of 81 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to Riverstone and its affiliates and 20 million newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock to certain funds managed by Capital World Investors and certain funds managed by Fidelity Management and Research Company. Silver Run expects to receive approximately $1 billion in net proceeds from these sales. NGP is expected to retain an approximate 11% interest in Centennial, which interest may be exchanged for 20 million shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock. Silver Run will not use debt financing to fund any portion of the cash consideration for the transaction.  In connection with the transaction, Silver Run and Centennial expect to repay all existing outstanding indebtedness and either replace or amend Centennial's revolving credit facility to permit the transaction. As of March 31, 2016, a maximum of $140 million was available for borrowing under Centennial's revolving credit facility.
Prior to closing the transaction, Silver Run's existing Class A stockholders will have the opportunity to vote on the transaction, and to redeem their shares of Class A common stock, if the transaction is approved and consummated. In the event any stockholders choose to have their shares redeemed, Riverstone and its affiliates expect to purchase an equivalent number of additional shares of Silver Run Class A Common Stock at $10.00 per share to fund such redemptions. 
The transaction is subject to approval of Silver Run stockholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in September 2016.
The description of the transaction contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the contribution and subscription agreements relating to the transaction.

SPE News | Interview: Ward Polzin, Centennial Resource Development



















































The Society of Petroleum Engineers
























There is often a disconnect between the consumers and producers of petroleum, which is why it's important to educate the public about how crude oil byproducts affect their everyday lives, Ward Polzin says. Thinkstock 


Interview: Ward Polzin, Centennial Resource Development
By Angela Dang, Chieke Offurum, and Colter Morgan
21 Jul 2015









Ward Polzin is chief executive officer of Centennial Resource Development, a Denver-based private oil and gas company backed by Natural Gas Partners. Polzin has more than 25 years of experience in the upstream oil and gas industry in engineering, commercial, investing, and transactional roles. Prior to forming Centennial, Polzin served as a managing director and founding partner in Investment Banking at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., where he spearheaded the firm’s exploration and production asset acquisition and divestiture practice since inception. Previously, Polzin served as the US country manager at Enerplus Resources and as a managing director with Scotia Waterous & Co. Polzin has been an SPE member for more than 25 years and is also a chartered financial analyst. He holds a BS in petroleum engineering from the Colorado School of Mines and an MBA from Rice University.
How would you describe the commodities industry and its role in the oil and gas sector?
The oil and gas commodities industry, i.e., the trading of oil and gas, is highly critical. Oil and gas being traded as a commodity signifies that it is a global industry. The trading of commodities— not just oil and gas, but any commodity— is a global endeavor. As such, the price is set by a global market. To me, that is the most critical factor about oil and gas. Interest rates and oil prices are probably the two variables that have the greatest impact on the global economy. Interest rates more so, but it also points to the importance of oil as a commodity.
Oil and gas as a global market really took off in the 1970s and 1980s with the rise of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the development of technology that physically allowed the barrel to move. The advent of the Internet and electronic technology that facilitates the stock and trading exchanges of the world also fueled the globalization of oil and gas trading.
What is the most common misconception about commodity prices and trends, specifically for oil and gas (either publicly or within the industry)?
There is an assumption that traders set the price. Prices, especially long term, are set by the market’s perception of supply and demand—that is not just traders, but also the end users and the producers of the commodity. There are really three large groups that trade: producers, users, and the “middle men,” or what some people may call traders or speculators. While they do influence prices and add volatility, they do not really set the prices.
The oil and gas industry does not dictate the price at which the products are sold. Which other industries are subject to the same challenge? How do they deal with such uncertainties?
There are several industries that are similar to oil and gas in terms of selling commodities—gold, silver, molybdenum, really anything that is mined. But I think maybe the industry that has the most in common with oil and gas is agriculture, whether crops (such as wheat) or livestock. The biggest challenge boils down to volatility—it is up some days, it is down others, which brings risk into the equation.
Simplistically, I see three ways (although there may be many more) for companies in the industry to protect themselves from volatile commodity prices. Firstly, you could hedge, meaning you can sell your product at a predetermined price—a forward sale of your product.
Secondly, you can diversify. If you are an oil producer, you have some gas in your portfolio. Or, if you are a gas producer, you can add some oil so that you are not exposed to just one commodity. You can also diversify by basin or country. Different basins have different price discounts so you can minimize some forms of price exposure this way.
Thirdly, you can work on becoming the low cost operator (LCO). If you can do it for less, you can handle the lower prices. We generally think of commodity in the traditional sense, referring to mining, oil, gas, agriculture, etc. But colloquially, people say, “my product has been ‘commoditized,’” meaning that anyone can produce my product. One example is solar panels, now being manufactured less expensively in China than they were a few years ago. Have solar panels become a commodity? Not in a conventional sense, but who survives? The LCO.
As the industry becomes more mature, ultimately, the prices are going to come down for whatever you produce. By becoming an LCO, you can better cope with the volatility.
What are the effects of price decline on the US’ status as an oil and gas exporter?
You have to divide gas and oil and talk about each separately because [the US] is not legally allowed to export crude oil, except to Canada. Each commodity has its own uniqueness in the technical and political challenges it faces to be moved around the world. Oil is legally difficult but logistically easy to move (just put it in tankers!). On the other hand, gas is easier politically, but hard logistically (complex and expensive liquefied natural gas [LNG] tankers). The good news is that now the [US] seems to allow for the export of (refined) condensate, which is a good step toward the ultimate export of oil.
The price decline creates a stronger desire for oil export. When prices are high, you are not as concerned with having access to more markets, but when prices are low, you just want all the markets you can find in which to sell the product. Low prices definitely put pressure on the US government to allow that, and certainly more pressure on oil companies to try and get that changed.
Gas is a good example of this. Since gas prices declined before oil price declined, it is one step ahead. Clearly, the LNG export facilities trying to be permitted and built are an example of that. The desire to export gas happened quicker because prices dropped quicker. Oil is following gas in this, so there is a higher motivation to export oil.
Given that the oil and gas industry is dictated by the price of its products, in your opinion, how important is it for engineers to understand this side of the industry?
Critically important. I guess it is a little self-serving because I have always been fascinated by the combination of finance and petroleum engineering. I have also spent half of my career in the more financial part of the industry. To me, it is natural to want to put the two together. Engineers definitely have that technical mind and quite frankly, if they have an interest in it, they can easily develop an understanding of the financial side.
One of the biggest concerns as a young engineer in the oil and gas industry is layoffs during the downturns. At what point does a company consider layoffs (i.e., why would a company consider layoffs vs. other cost-cutting measures)?
In a downturn, layoffs are not the first thing that happens. First come the spending cuts. Even though people are expensive, wells are more expensive, so the first steps are cutting capital, drilling less, and slowing down projects. The second cost-cutting target is lease operating expenses. These are the costs of maintaining and operating property and equipment on a producing oil and gas lease. Third is the cutting of general and administrative expenses (G&A). The primary G&A expense is people. 
The next obvious question as a professional in the industry is how to deal with it. In difficult times, if you are already employed, you want to make sure you are working on the best assets, because the company is going to slow drilling in the worst assets first. You do not always control where you are posted, but if you can, working the asset that stands the test of time is certainly a good place to be.
For the folks who are still trying to find that job, I can relate to that extremely well because I graduated in 1984 (from Colorado School of Mines) when there were minimal jobs. I already loved the finance side and I could see it coming a year ahead of time so I went and got a business degree. Getting a higher education meant the addition of another skill to my resume. Graduating from business school in 1986 was even worse, but thankfully I had two degrees so that set me apart. There is nothing wrong with going back to school, but I have always advised folks against getting an extra degree just because it looks better on your resume. You better like learning. Pursue something that truly interests you. If you have that interest and desire, go for it, do it right now, and you will be that much better and more competitive coming out of graduate school.
Deciding on whether to pursue a business degree or a technical degree beyond the undergraduate level is one reserved for the individual. A master’s in petroleum engineering would not have been right for me, because I just loved combining the finances with the engineering. Either is a good route; it is just a matter of personal preference.
What personal advice can you give young engineers about working in the volatile oil and gas industry?
One can use the same strategies that oil and gas companies use to minimize risk to navigate the industry. 
Hedge. How an individual hedges is education. Make sure you are constantly learning so that you are not pigeonholed into only knowing one part of the business.
Diversify. As a person, diversifying does not mean you get a different job; it just means that you make sure to keep your petroleum engineering skills broad. Yes, have a focus—maybe you are a completions engineer or a reservoir engineer—but you should be learning all you can about the other engineering disciplines. Even though you do not become an expert, it is important to appreciate and understand all the parts of the puzzle in getting oil out of the ground and moving it.
Be an LCO. From an individual’s standpoint, it means bringing more value as opposed to cost to your employer. You have to be able to do more than what is being asked of you, digging deeper to understand the numbers a little bit better, and taking a project further than “the answer.” It is not about having the answer; it is about what you do with that answer—provide a solution and implement it.
In a 2012 The New York Times Op- Ed article titled “The High Cost of Gambling on Oil,” Joseph P. Kennedy II states, “[speculators] add little value and lots of cost as they bid up the price of oil in pursuit of financial gain. They should be banned from the world’s commodity exchanges, which could drive down the price of oil by as much as 40 percent and the price of gasoline by as much as $1 a gallon.” Any thoughts on this statement?
I disagree with the strength of the statement that Kennedy makes. The speculators and traders who were operating in 2012 are still operating today. This article probably would not have been written in 2015, yet the speculators are doing today what they were doing then. Speculators did not drive oil prices up and they did not drive it down. If you believe in capitalism, I think you need to have these exchanges and traders.
Usually speculation has a negative connotation, but I do not treat it that way. Exchanges and traders are just a part of a capitalist system. If you have ever bought a stock or mutual fund, you are speculating. If you are buying it, you think the price is going to go up. If you are selling it, you think it is going to go down. If there are more people buying it, it is going to drive the price up, and if there are more people selling, the price is going to be driven down. So I think we are all speculators in lots of ways, but obviously not to the extent that some are. While oil and gas speculators make an impact, they are not the main driver of prices.
One could argue that our dependence on fossil fuels has become crippling. Would you consider gas a luxury resource? In other words, do oil and gas as commodities bear more resemblance to wheat or lobster?
I very much think it bears more resemblance to wheat because it is the lifeblood of our society. Oil and gas is a fundamental resource, but I would say that about all energy, not just oil and gas. Energy drives the world, whether it is renewables, nuclear, or fossil fuels. I do not think that the world’s dependence on fossil fuels is crippling. Based on what I have read, a country’s gross domestic product can be increased the quickest by using oil as compared to all other fuels.
The more mature the country’s economy gets, the less and less it uses fossil fuels and it can begin to switch to other sources of energy. It is a great way of quickly bringing up the quality of life in poorer countries.
There is often a disconnect between the consumers and producers of petroleum. Users of petroleum projects revel in the low price of oil because it means a low cost of gasoline, but to those in the industry, low oil price means job losses and a jeopardizing of economic security. What would you recommend to close this gap in understanding?
Boy! That is something we have been trying to do for decades. There are some standard industry responses to that. We have not been very good, as an industry, at communicating our role in the economy and jobs, but we are getting better. I think just about anybody would say that. More specifically, how do you get better? Make it more local.
There are a lot of commercials and data available at the national level. With states like North Dakota, Colorado, and Pennsylvania seeing big developments in recent years, organizations have been created in response to bridge the communication gap between industry and the public. Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development, for example, really brings it down to the state level—here is the impact in our state. Individual companies can take it one step further. Here [in Colorado], companies like Noble Energy, Anadarko, and Encana have held public meetings at the county level, bringing industry employees out to the community. The more local you get the better; people can really see examples of oil and gas working well with the community.
I also think it is important to educate the public about how crude oil byproducts affect their everyday lives. Outside of the obvious contributions to transportation, lighting, heating, and cooling, it is making sure people understand how much of their world is built on fossil fuels.
Young engineers make great ambassadors for the industry. You know a lot; even though you may not appreciate it, you are an expert. You need to be unafraid to speak up and politely debate the topics with people.
From a social responsibility perspective, can hydrocarbon consumers and producers strike a balance where profit margins are met and sustainability can be achieved? In other words, can oil and gas companies still make money, but take an active role in promoting conservation of natural resources and the pursuit of renewable energy resources?
I think we can achieve that balance. When you are in the industry, you may not pay attention to the effect of high oil prices on the economy. Conversely, those who are not in the industry may not appreciate the tradeoff. In a USD 50/bbl world, there is just no way oil and gas companies make enough money long-term. But at USD 120/bbl you can make, in a sense, too much money and our industry will be targeted. I think there is a happy balance where we make money as companies and the greater society has a strong economy. At USD 80/bbl or USD 90/bbl oil, economies zoomed right along, but I think at USD 120/bbl oil, economies started to hurt. There definitely is a place where we can meet in the middle from a profitability standpoint.
There is a balance we have to strike in the lifestyle we lead, not just in the US but in the world. We cannot innovate— create the Internet, develop new medicines—if we are a poor society. A lot of that ability to innovate stems from our access to cheap energy.
