You’ll want to create a profile/account. Your profile captures work history and educational background, as well as your job preferences. You can specify the type of job, location, or new store opening you’re interested in. Once you create your profile, you can choose to receive email notifications when a job is posted that matches your preferences. 





            Do you have part-time jobs?



We offer part-time positions in Stores, depending on the specific position and business need. We also hire seasonal positions at certain times of the year, particularly during the holiday season.

Big Lots associates must be at least 18 years of age.
 





            I’ve worked for Big Lots before. How do I reapply?



Thanks for your interest in returning to Big Lots! If you worked for Big Lots prior to September 2015, you should create a profile/account and search for jobs.

Account Questions



            Why should I create a profile/account?



To be formally considered for a position at Big Lots, we ask that you create a profile/account. It’s quick and easy and by creating your profile, you automatically set up your account. Once you’ve created your profile, you’ll have the opportunity to attach a resume, express your job preference, and create alerts that will provide you with email notifications when positions that meet your interests are posted. 





            I forgot my Password. How do I reset it?



Please ensure that you have the most updated internet browser version.  We recommend using Google Chrome or Firefox
Log In
Click "Sign In" option at the top right of your screen
Click on "Forget your password
Enter your User Name and Email Address
Follow the directions in the email by clicking on the link in the email and enter User Name and Access Code provided in the email
In the final screen, enter your Access Code again, enter your Personalized Password, and re-enter Personalized Password





            I forgot my User Name. How do I find it?



On the website Log In screen, click on the “Forgot your User Name?” link. You will need to know your email address used to create your profile/account, and click Validate. Your User Name will appear on the screen.





            I am a new user and want to create a profile. Why does the system say a record already exists under the User Name I selected?



If you click on New User and, while creating a user name and Password, the system gives you an error message that says “a valid record already exists under this User Name,” it means that someone already has an account under the User Name you are trying to create. Or, you created a profile with that User Name and you don’t remember your Password. We recommend creating a unique user name that includes both letters and numbers. User Names must be 4-32 characters long and cannot contains spaces.





            I am having trouble getting past the Work History portion of my Secondary Pass Application. What do I need to do?



In most cases you might be having trouble with this section because of the way the Country and State were filled in on each of your Work Experiences. To fix, remove all information in the Country and State fields. Next, click on the word “Search” to the right of the field. When looking up Country, in the keyword section, enter United States and click “Search”. You will receive a list to choose from. Make your selection. When looking up State, in the keyword section, enter your State and click “Search”. You will receive a list to choose from. Make your selection.
Remember you will need to do this for each one of your Work Experiences you have listed in your application.





            How do I unsubscribe to job posting email notifications?



You’ll need to log in to your account, click on My Account Options at the top of the Job Search tab, scroll to the Correspondence section and click “Edit”. Uncheck the “send an email notification whenever a new position matching this profile becomes available” box and click “Save”. Your email preferences will now be updated.

Here’s a sign that investors may be too pessimistic about brick-and-mortar retailers

Jul. 18, 2017 at 3:54 a.m. ET
by Michael Brush









Big Lots' stock gets a big boost after profit beat, raised outlook
Shares of Big Lots Inc.  soared 7.5% toward a 2 1/2-month high in premarket trade Friday, after the discount retailer beat fiscal first-quarter profit expectations and provided an upbeat outlook. Net income rose to $51.5 million, or $1.15 a share, from $38.7 million, or 79 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, compared with the FactSet consensus for earnings per share of 99 cents. Revenue slipped to $1.30 billion from $1.31 billion, just missing the FactSet consensus of $1.31 billion, as the same-store sales decline of 0.9% missed expectations of a 0.9% increase. The company expects second-quarter EPS of 58 cents to 63 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 57 cents, with same-store sales growth in the low single-digit percentage range, compared with expectations of 1.8% growth. The company increased its 2017 EPS outlook to $4.05 to $4.20 from $3.95 to $4.10. The stock, which changed hands premarket at the highest level seen during regular session hours since March 8, has slipped 3.7% year to date through Thursday, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has declined 7.4% and the S&P 500  has gained 7.9%.

Week In Review: Stocks Hit Highs On FANGs; Oil Dives After OPEC; Best Buy, Ulta Shine
The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite hit record highs on Thursday, completing a quick recovery from the May 17 market plunge as FANG stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) led the way. Oil prices, which had been steadily rising ahead of OPEC's key meeting, tumbled after the cartel extended production cuts. Meanwhile, Best Buy (BBY) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) were among the few retailers to defy the

The Top Dog Vs. The Big Threat, In Retail Consumer Electronics
The current earnings season has penned one more chapter in the ongoing drama portraying retail as a barren wasteland of hollowed-out malls, sliding into the inevitable nightfall of Amazon.com (AMZN). But while department store and apparel retail stocks have veered into deepening losses, Best Buy shares are up 18% for the year through Thursday. That is far behind Amazon's 28% gain, and Amazon's sales are growing fast. But Best Buy continues to hold

Big Lots!, Inc. is an American retail company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Big Lots has over 1,400 stores in 48 states.[2]
Its department stores sell a wide variety of merchandise, including packaged food and beverages, toys, furniture, clothing, housewares, and small electronics, much of which is closed out or overstocked merchandise. Many of the items in these stores sell out quickly: in the store one day, but gone the next, with no replenishments coming. Many other items, such as foodstuffs, are stocked continually.
In many cases, Big Lots! uses buildings formerly occupied by other stores. When Rite Aid Inc moved many Payless Drugstores into newly designed, stand-alone buildings, Big Lots (Pic 'N' Save) opened many new stores of its own in those newly vacant, open-air plaza storefronts.[3]

History[edit]




Big Lots Store No. 1, Berwick Plaza Shopping Center, Columbus, Ohio (Before and after); The first store in the Big Lots chain was located in the former Kroger store in the same shopping center. The store was later relocated to the former Buckeye Mart/Sarco building also pictured.


The Big Lots chain traces its history back to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated's Odd Lots stores expanded from Columbus, Revco took issue with the fact that another closeout retailer was operating a chain with national aspirations that had a similar name as the Revco-owned subsidiary. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit their use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond the radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.[4]
Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean DMC-12 models, then still at the factory in Northern Ireland, when the US importer was unable to import them. This unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on the Big Lots web site's "Closeout Museum" page.
In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, Big Lots Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the Big Lots brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops. A year later, the company decided to focus on the Big Lots brand, and on May 16, 2001, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. By the end of 2002, Big Lots Inc. completed a nationwide conversion to the single Big Lots brand. On November 19, 2010 opened 17 new stores bringing its total to over 1400 stores. [5]Recently, Big Lots has expanded by opening hundreds of new stores.[6]
In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing Big Lots Furniture specialty stores.[7] Most Big Lots stores have furniture departments which sell upholstered furniture (sofas, love seats, and recliners), Serta mattresses, fully assembled and ready to assemble furniture. Some, primarily smaller, stores only carry a limited assortment of mattresses and ready to assemble furniture.
On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.[8]

Big Lots Wholesale[edit]
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk for resale from a variety of categories. This was a separate division of Big Lots and did not carry the same merchandise found in the retail stores. Big Lots Wholesale also attended trade shows and had permanent showrooms in Columbus, New York City; and the Boston and Chicago areas.
Big Lots closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 Fiscal Year. The Columbus-based closeout retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years. [9]
Big Lots Canada[edit]
Main article: LW Stores
On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations. The cost of the acquisition was $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This represents Big Lots first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, St. Catharines, Ontario and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
On December, 5 2013, Big Lots announced that it will exit the Canadian marketplace citing poor sales. All stores were shut down by February 2014. The company expected to post a loss from the Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of $38 million to $43 million, mostly on severance, leases and asset writedowns. It expected to lose another $44 million to $47 million in the first quarter next year.[10]

Big Lots!, Inc. is an American retail company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Big Lots has over 1,400 stores in 48 states.[2]
Its department stores sell a wide variety of merchandise, including packaged food and beverages, toys, furniture, clothing, housewares, and small electronics, much of which is closed out or overstocked merchandise. Many of the items in these stores sell out quickly: in the store one day, but gone the next, with no replenishments coming. Many other items, such as foodstuffs, are stocked continually.
In many cases, Big Lots! uses buildings formerly occupied by other stores. When Rite Aid Inc moved many Payless Drugstores into newly designed, stand-alone buildings, Big Lots (Pic 'N' Save) opened many new stores of its own in those newly vacant, open-air plaza storefronts.[3]

History[edit]




Big Lots Store No. 1, Berwick Plaza Shopping Center, Columbus, Ohio (Before and after); The first store in the Big Lots chain was located in the former Kroger store in the same shopping center. The store was later relocated to the former Buckeye Mart/Sarco building also pictured.


The Big Lots chain traces its history back to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated's Odd Lots stores expanded from Columbus, Revco took issue with the fact that another closeout retailer was operating a chain with national aspirations that had a similar name as the Revco-owned subsidiary. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit their use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond the radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.[4]
Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean DMC-12 models, then still at the factory in Northern Ireland, when the US importer was unable to import them. This unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on the Big Lots web site's "Closeout Museum" page.
In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, Big Lots Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the Big Lots brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops. A year later, the company decided to focus on the Big Lots brand, and on May 16, 2001, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. By the end of 2002, Big Lots Inc. completed a nationwide conversion to the single Big Lots brand. On November 19, 2010 opened 17 new stores bringing its total to over 1400 stores. [5]Recently, Big Lots has expanded by opening hundreds of new stores.[6]
In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing Big Lots Furniture specialty stores.[7] Most Big Lots stores have furniture departments which sell upholstered furniture (sofas, love seats, and recliners), Serta mattresses, fully assembled and ready to assemble furniture. Some, primarily smaller, stores only carry a limited assortment of mattresses and ready to assemble furniture.
On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.[8]

Big Lots Wholesale[edit]
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk for resale from a variety of categories. This was a separate division of Big Lots and did not carry the same merchandise found in the retail stores. Big Lots Wholesale also attended trade shows and had permanent showrooms in Columbus, New York City; and the Boston and Chicago areas.
Big Lots closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 Fiscal Year. The Columbus-based closeout retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years. [9]
Big Lots Canada[edit]
Main article: LW Stores
On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations. The cost of the acquisition was $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This represents Big Lots first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, St. Catharines, Ontario and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
On December, 5 2013, Big Lots announced that it will exit the Canadian marketplace citing poor sales. All stores were shut down by February 2014. The company expected to post a loss from the Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of $38 million to $43 million, mostly on severance, leases and asset writedowns. It expected to lose another $44 million to $47 million in the first quarter next year.[10]

Test your product: Make sure that there’s a demand for your product and the customer understands what you are selling when it’s on the shelf and nobody is there to explain it. Learn more about Product Testing

How to submit product to Big Lots
There are several ways to get a product placed in Big Lots. However, most entrepreneurs only dream about getting their product distributed to major retailers, few actually do it. We have experienced a significant rise in interest since the show Shark Tank started airing on NBC. Mr. Checkout has had the pleasure of working with a few Shark Tank success stories such as KISStixx and 180 Party Cups which are now currently being distributed around the country to stores like Walmart, Target, Kroger, 7-Eleven and more.
If you envision your product would be a good fit for Big Lots, we have a few steps to help you get your product on their shelves.
Submit Your Product Now
 
 
 
We are a national distribution network of over 1,000 distributors, wagon jobbers and merchandisers that introduce new products into stores every day with our blitz program. We are a membership organization that provides access to our database of distributors, a custom landing page on our website and access to the country’s largest wholesaler network. Since 1989 we have been bringing new products to market and have seen successful placements in nearly every major big box retailer in the country. Over the years we have learned the best ways to place a product in retail stores like Big Lots, and are available to help you accomplish your distribution goals. We make it easy:
Here are the 6 steps you need to take to have your product placed in Big Lots.
1. Start with the right questions.) Before you try distributing your product to Big Lots, you need to ask yourself a few basic questions. Do you need to build demand for your product, or is there already a demand for it? Do you know that Big Lots would be interested in selling your product? If you can strike a deal with Big Lots, can you handle the production volume? Do you want to sell directly to Big Lots, or do you want to license your product to a manufacturer that will handle distribution?

2. Be prepared to profit.) Does your product offer enough of a profit margin for Big Lots? Can you sell your product at a reasonable enough profit to cover the packaging, shipping, commissions, marketing and wholesale distribution? Check Big Lots’s guidelines for other fees that you will have to build into the cost of your product in order for you to be able to turn enough of a profit to make the effort worth your while. If you work with a discount retailer, they will try to strip your profits down to zero in order to keep their prices as low as possible.
The typical breakdown of margins are: If a products costs $1 to produce, that product will retail for $4. That product that retails for $4 will wholesale for $2 to distributors and stores that purchase direct. Big box retailers like Big Lots may offer to pay $1.25 to the manufacturer if the product costs $1 to produce. That is the typical profit margin.

3. Determine if Big Lots is the right store for your product.) The relationship between you and Big Lots starts with you browsing their store for competing products. If Big Lots already has a similar product, it is going to be very difficult to get your product picked up. Spend some time at your local Big Lots to see what kind of products they are selling, speak to the manager and see if he thinks your product will sell well in their store. Picture in which zone your product would best fit on the shelf and keep in mind that the most precious asset that these big box stores value are their shelf space. Keep this information in mind when you are preparing your presentation to Big Lots.
If your company is minority or women owned, check Big Lots’s website and see if they offer specific opportunities for those designations.

4. Pitch your product to Big Lots.) Decide whether it will be you or a representative to present your product to Big Lots. Your presentation depends heavily on your strengths as a businessperson as they will most likely ask financial questions and logistics questions.
It’s common for companies to hire a broker to pitch their product to Big Lots, as it will be more likely that your product will make it to the next stage if the individual pitching your product has industry knowledge or a personal relationship with Big Lots. The percentage of commission verses, however generally a broker will take around 5% to represent your product to Big Lots.
We at Mr. Checkout have experience dealing with brokers and know that there are several retail brokers that have poor business practices that can potentially damage your brand. If you are seeking a legitimate Big Lots broker, please give us a call for a recommendation. It could save you a huge headache and a lot of money.

5. Complete the required Big Lots paperwork.) Often Big Lots will have you go through an application process. However, before submitting the paperwork required by Big Lots, you should contact a buyer at Big Lots and let them know your intentions. Having a contact inside of the company will potentially move your application more smoothly through the process.

6. Anticipate the need for increased volume.) Having Big Lots agree to stock your product will most likely mean a significant increase in volume. You should be prepared to ramp up your production and informing your manufacturer of this opportunity.
Having production, logistics and distribution to sync is not only difficult, it requires a significant amount of time invested in customer relations. Also, Big Lots may have stipulations in the contract that may penalize you for delays in shipping and production. Have an attorney explain all contracts to you if you don’t understand the terms.
If you’re looking to distribute your product to Big Lots, be sure to thoroughly assess the marketplace, carefully prepare for production growth, and take full advantage of resources available to help you grow your business.

Big Lots!, Inc. is an American retail company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Big Lots has over 1,400 stores in 48 states.[2]
Its department stores sell a wide variety of merchandise, including packaged food and beverages, toys, furniture, clothing, housewares, and small electronics, much of which is closed out or overstocked merchandise. Many of the items in these stores sell out quickly: in the store one day, but gone the next, with no replenishments coming. Many other items, such as foodstuffs, are stocked continually.
In many cases, Big Lots! uses buildings formerly occupied by other stores. When Rite Aid Inc moved many Payless Drugstores into newly designed, stand-alone buildings, Big Lots (Pic 'N' Save) opened many new stores of its own in those newly vacant, open-air plaza storefronts.[3]

History[edit]




Big Lots Store No. 1, Berwick Plaza Shopping Center, Columbus, Ohio (Before and after); The first store in the Big Lots chain was located in the former Kroger store in the same shopping center. The store was later relocated to the former Buckeye Mart/Sarco building also pictured.


The Big Lots chain traces its history back to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated's Odd Lots stores expanded from Columbus, Revco took issue with the fact that another closeout retailer was operating a chain with national aspirations that had a similar name as the Revco-owned subsidiary. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit their use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond the radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.[4]
Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean DMC-12 models, then still at the factory in Northern Ireland, when the US importer was unable to import them. This unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on the Big Lots web site's "Closeout Museum" page.
In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, Big Lots Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the Big Lots brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops. A year later, the company decided to focus on the Big Lots brand, and on May 16, 2001, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. By the end of 2002, Big Lots Inc. completed a nationwide conversion to the single Big Lots brand. On November 19, 2010 opened 17 new stores bringing its total to over 1400 stores. [5]Recently, Big Lots has expanded by opening hundreds of new stores.[6]
In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing Big Lots Furniture specialty stores.[7] Most Big Lots stores have furniture departments which sell upholstered furniture (sofas, love seats, and recliners), Serta mattresses, fully assembled and ready to assemble furniture. Some, primarily smaller, stores only carry a limited assortment of mattresses and ready to assemble furniture.
On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.[8]

Big Lots Wholesale[edit]
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk for resale from a variety of categories. This was a separate division of Big Lots and did not carry the same merchandise found in the retail stores. Big Lots Wholesale also attended trade shows and had permanent showrooms in Columbus, New York City; and the Boston and Chicago areas.
Big Lots closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 Fiscal Year. The Columbus-based closeout retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years. [9]
Big Lots Canada[edit]
Main article: LW Stores
On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations. The cost of the acquisition was $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This represents Big Lots first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, St. Catharines, Ontario and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
On December, 5 2013, Big Lots announced that it will exit the Canadian marketplace citing poor sales. All stores were shut down by February 2014. The company expected to post a loss from the Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of $38 million to $43 million, mostly on severance, leases and asset writedowns. It expected to lose another $44 million to $47 million in the first quarter next year.[10]

Big Lots!, Inc. is an American retail company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Big Lots has over 1,400 stores in 48 states.[2]
Its department stores sell a wide variety of merchandise, including packaged food and beverages, toys, furniture, clothing, housewares, and small electronics, much of which is closed out or overstocked merchandise. Many of the items in these stores sell out quickly: in the store one day, but gone the next, with no replenishments coming. Many other items, such as foodstuffs, are stocked continually.
In many cases, Big Lots! uses buildings formerly occupied by other stores. When Rite Aid Inc moved many Payless Drugstores into newly designed, stand-alone buildings, Big Lots (Pic 'N' Save) opened many new stores of its own in those newly vacant, open-air plaza storefronts.[3]

History[edit]




Big Lots Store No. 1, Berwick Plaza Shopping Center, Columbus, Ohio (Before and after); The first store in the Big Lots chain was located in the former Kroger store in the same shopping center. The store was later relocated to the former Buckeye Mart/Sarco building also pictured.


The Big Lots chain traces its history back to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated's Odd Lots stores expanded from Columbus, Revco took issue with the fact that another closeout retailer was operating a chain with national aspirations that had a similar name as the Revco-owned subsidiary. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit their use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond the radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.[4]
Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean DMC-12 models, then still at the factory in Northern Ireland, when the US importer was unable to import them. This unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on the Big Lots web site's "Closeout Museum" page.
In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, Big Lots Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the Big Lots brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops. A year later, the company decided to focus on the Big Lots brand, and on May 16, 2001, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. By the end of 2002, Big Lots Inc. completed a nationwide conversion to the single Big Lots brand. On November 19, 2010 opened 17 new stores bringing its total to over 1400 stores. [5]Recently, Big Lots has expanded by opening hundreds of new stores.[6]
In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing Big Lots Furniture specialty stores.[7] Most Big Lots stores have furniture departments which sell upholstered furniture (sofas, love seats, and recliners), Serta mattresses, fully assembled and ready to assemble furniture. Some, primarily smaller, stores only carry a limited assortment of mattresses and ready to assemble furniture.
On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.[8]

Big Lots Wholesale[edit]
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk for resale from a variety of categories. This was a separate division of Big Lots and did not carry the same merchandise found in the retail stores. Big Lots Wholesale also attended trade shows and had permanent showrooms in Columbus, New York City; and the Boston and Chicago areas.
Big Lots closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 Fiscal Year. The Columbus-based closeout retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years. [9]
Big Lots Canada[edit]
Main article: LW Stores
On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations. The cost of the acquisition was $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This represents Big Lots first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, St. Catharines, Ontario and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
On December, 5 2013, Big Lots announced that it will exit the Canadian marketplace citing poor sales. All stores were shut down by February 2014. The company expected to post a loss from the Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of $38 million to $43 million, mostly on severance, leases and asset writedowns. It expected to lose another $44 million to $47 million in the first quarter next year.[10]

Big Lots!, Inc. is an American retail company headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Big Lots has over 1,400 stores in 48 states.[2]
Its department stores sell a wide variety of merchandise, including packaged food and beverages, toys, furniture, clothing, housewares, and small electronics, much of which is closed out or overstocked merchandise. Many of the items in these stores sell out quickly: in the store one day, but gone the next, with no replenishments coming. Many other items, such as foodstuffs, are stocked continually.
In many cases, Big Lots! uses buildings formerly occupied by other stores. When Rite Aid Inc moved many Payless Drugstores into newly designed, stand-alone buildings, Big Lots (Pic 'N' Save) opened many new stores of its own in those newly vacant, open-air plaza storefronts.[3]

History[edit]




Big Lots Store No. 1, Berwick Plaza Shopping Center, Columbus, Ohio (Before and after); The first store in the Big Lots chain was located in the former Kroger store in the same shopping center. The store was later relocated to the former Buckeye Mart/Sarco building also pictured.


The Big Lots chain traces its history back to 1967 when Consolidated Stores Corporation was formed in Ohio by Sol Shenk. In 1982, Consolidated Stores Corp. opened its first closeout store, called Odd Lots, in Columbus, Ohio. In 1983, drug store chain Revco bought New Jersey closeout retailer Odd Lot Trading Co. As Consolidated's Odd Lots stores expanded from Columbus, Revco took issue with the fact that another closeout retailer was operating a chain with national aspirations that had a similar name as the Revco-owned subsidiary. Consolidated Stores Corp. agreed to limit their use of the Odd Lots name to stores located within a certain radius of Columbus. Beyond the radius, Consolidated began opening stores under the Big Lots name. Eventually, all Odd Lots stores were rebranded as Big Lots. In 1985, Consolidated Stores Corp. began trading as a separate public company on the American Stock Exchange. In 1986, Consolidated Stores Corp. switched to the New York Stock Exchange, trading under the symbol CNS.[4]
Consolidated Stores Corp. was an investor in the DeLorean Motor Company, which declared bankruptcy in 1982. Consolidated took possession of approximately 100 DeLorean DMC-12 models, then still at the factory in Northern Ireland, when the US importer was unable to import them. This unusual excess inventory acquisition is commemorated on the Big Lots web site's "Closeout Museum" page.
In 1994, Consolidated Stores Corp. acquired Toy Liquidators, adding 82 stores in 38 states. Looking to expand further into the toys business, Consolidated Stores Corp. purchased KB Toys from Melville Corporation in 1996. In 1997, Big Lots Inc. bought out 'MacFrugals' (Pic 'N' Save) stores for $995 million in stock, eventually converting those to the Big Lots brand. In 2000, Consolidated Stores Corp. sold the KB Toys and Toy Liquidators lines to private equity shops. A year later, the company decided to focus on the Big Lots brand, and on May 16, 2001, Consolidated Stores Corp. changed its name to Big Lots, Inc. and its ticker symbol from CNS to BLI. By the end of 2002, Big Lots Inc. completed a nationwide conversion to the single Big Lots brand. On November 19, 2010 opened 17 new stores bringing its total to over 1400 stores. [5]Recently, Big Lots has expanded by opening hundreds of new stores.[6]
In the later part of 2005, Big Lots closed 170 stores, including all free-standing Big Lots Furniture specialty stores.[7] Most Big Lots stores have furniture departments which sell upholstered furniture (sofas, love seats, and recliners), Serta mattresses, fully assembled and ready to assemble furniture. Some, primarily smaller, stores only carry a limited assortment of mattresses and ready to assemble furniture.
On August 3, 2006, Big Lots announced it would change its New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol from BLI to BIG, beginning with trading activity on August 18, 2006.[8]

Big Lots Wholesale[edit]
Big Lots operated a wholesale division which provided merchandise in bulk for resale from a variety of categories. This was a separate division of Big Lots and did not carry the same merchandise found in the retail stores. Big Lots Wholesale also attended trade shows and had permanent showrooms in Columbus, New York City; and the Boston and Chicago areas.
Big Lots closed its wholesale division at the end of the 2013 Fiscal Year. The Columbus-based closeout retailer had conducted wholesale operations through Big Lots Wholesale, Consolidated International and Wisconsin Toy for more than 34 years. [9]
Big Lots Canada[edit]
Main article: LW Stores
On July 19, 2011, Big Lots announced that it had purchased Liquidation World Inc., a Canadian closeout retailer with 89 locations. The cost of the acquisition was $20 million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities. This represents Big Lots first retail venture outside of the US. The first Big Lots location opened in April 2013 in Orillia, Ontario followed by Burlington, Ontario, Niagara Falls, Ontario, St. Catharines, Ontario and Thunder Bay, Ontario.
On December, 5 2013, Big Lots announced that it will exit the Canadian marketplace citing poor sales. All stores were shut down by February 2014. The company expected to post a loss from the Canadian operations in the fourth quarter of $38 million to $43 million, mostly on severance, leases and asset writedowns. It expected to lose another $44 million to $47 million in the first quarter next year.[10]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
