      Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc. (RMCF) is a leading chain of
      confectionery stores. The company has about 300 retail locations in the
      United States (concentrated primarily on the West Coast and in the Sun
      Belt), Canada, Guam, and the United Arab Emirates, and a
      53,000-square-foot factory near Durango, Colorado. The retail stores are
      typically located in tourist areas or factory outlet malls; all but a
      handful are franchised. Unable to find a suitable shipper, the company has
      built its own fleet of brown and bronze refrigerated semis. The factory
      produces 300 types of candies, and retail stores also produce a number of
      hand-dipped items using traditional methods. The best-selling items are
      caramel apples, followed by "Bears" (turtles). One key to
      the company's success is the experience of many of the confections
      being whipped up at the stores. Marketing Executive Ed Dudley described it
      this way in the 
      
        Rocky Mountain News:
      
       "Because all of your senses are engaged, it's about giving
      the customer a five- to 10-minute vacation."
    

      Creating a Sweet Job in Colorado
    

      The Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory (RMCF) was built around a location
      and a lifestyle. Franklin E. Crail had owned a thriving company in Newport
      Beach, California, that produced billing software for the cable TV
      industry (CNI Data Processing, Inc.). But he and his wife wanted to raise
      a family in a small town. They settled in Durango, Colorado, where Crail
      prospected for an entrepreneurial niche. "It came down to either a
      car wash or a chocolate shop," he says in the company's
      official history.
    

      Frank Crail later told 
      
        Candy Industry
      
       he would have been content to open a See's Candy store, but the
      California company did not franchise. Instead, he enlisted two partners
      and opened the first RMCF shop on Durango's Main Street on Memorial
      Day, 1981. The town was something of a tourist attraction, known for its
      scenic railroad and outdoor recreation. Many future stores also would be
      opened in vacation spots in order to be close to a large volume of
      traffic.
    

      The stores themselves became tourist attractions in their own right, with
      much of the confection-making process on display. Trademarks included
      hand-dipped caramel apples and fresh fudge, heated in copper kettles and
      cooled on a 500-pound marble slab. The selection was staggering, with some
      stores offering 30 kinds of apples, ranging from basic caramel to a
      gourmet white chocolate and Oreo masterpiece. Wholesale chocolate was
      sourced from Burlingame, California's Guittard Chocolate Company
      and other suppliers.
    

      True to its rugged mountain origins, RMCF became known for its big, chunky
      portions. One of its peanut butter cups was large enough to be called the
      "Bucket." The chocolate also won awards for taste.
    

      The venture was successful from the start. Although tourist traffic was
      strong in the summer, locals shopped for gifts for Christmas and
      Valentine's Day. Crail's partners opened other stores in
      Breckenridge and Boulder, Colorado, within a year.
    

      The first franchised stores were opened in 1982 in Colorado Springs and
      Park City, Utah. Crail later told 
      
        ColoradoBiz
      
       that the typical franchisee was a professional who wanted to set out upon
      a second career in a small, family-oriented town, much as Crail himself
      had done.
    

      An off-site chocolate factory also was opened in 1982, and Rocky Mountain
      Chocolate Factory, Inc. was incorporated in November of that year.
      Crail's two partners left the business in 1983.
    

      Public in 1986
    

      Crail took the company public on the NASDAQ in February 1986. Revenues
      were about $4.1 million for fiscal 1985–86, up more than 10
      percent, though the loss tripled to $146,706. The loss increased to $1.8
      million in fiscal 1986–87, when revenues were up to $4.5 million.
      The company then had 55 stores in 13 states.
    

      Revenues rose 14 percent to $5 million in the fiscal year ended February
      28, 1991, and net income slipped to $520,006 from $637,385. Ten of about
      64 stores had closed, but the company was opening a handful of new ones.
      RMCF tested a mail-order catalog for Christmas 1991.
    

      The company posted a loss of $34,000 in 1992 but soon recovered. Revenues
      were up to $13.6 million by 1995, with net income of $1.3 million. 
      
        Chain Store Age
      
       pronounced RMCF founder Frank Crail one of its Entrepreneurs of the Year
      for 1995. A survey in 
      
        Money
      
       magazine rated the company's chocolates superior to those from
      established chocolatiers such as Godiva and Fanny May.
    

      By 1996, RMCF was making about two million pounds of candy a year.
      Revenues were $18.7 million. It had 350 employees, including 125 at the
      main factory. There were 162 stores, 45 of which were company-owned, from
      San Francisco, California, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The
      company had opened a side venture, FuzziWig's, which sold hard
      candy (outsourced) for children at five locations.
    

      In the summer of 1996, RMCF created a seven-foot, 430-pound white
      chocolate alligator for display at the San Francisco Zoo. The replica had
      more than one million calories and was worth $6,000, reported 
      
        Candy Industry.
      
       Miniature versions were available for purchase.
    

      Retooling in the Late 1990s
    

      There were a couple of major refinements to RMCF's formula in the
      late 1990s. Most of the company-owned retail operations were closed or
      sold to franchises, allowing RMCF to focus on franchising and
      manufacturing. Nine stores were closed in 1997; the restructuring led to a
      full-year loss of $1.2 million. The company also was automating some of
      its factory operations after years of making almost everything by hand.
    

      Kansas City, Missouri chocolate giant Whitman's Candies Inc., a
      unit of Russell Stover Candies Inc., made an offer to buy RMCF for around
      $16 million in 1999 but was rebuffed by management after RMCF's
      operating results improved later in the year.
    

      With 125 employees in Durango, Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory was the
      town's largest manufacturer, according to 
      
        ColoradoBiz.
      
       It still had 34 company-owned stores. RMCF signed a franchisee in the
      United Arab Emirates in 2000.
    

      New Look in 2001
    

      A new logo and revitalized packaging were introduced in time for the
      Christmas 2001 season. Sleek new copper gift boxes were designed to
      reinforce the association with the copper cooking kettles. The stores were
      modernized as well. The company's logo was meant to represent
      swirling chocolate. Only 10 percent of sales stemmed from purchases of
      gifts, and the company was focusing on increasing that, COO Bryan Merryman
      told the 
      
        Rocky Mountain News.
      


      The product line expanded to include no-sugar-added and sugar-free
      candies. Factory-made products accounted for half of store sales,
      according to 
      
        Confectioner
      
      ; store-made products accounted for another 40 percent, with the remainder
      coming from other manufacturers. A new factory-made product developed
      between 2000 and 2002 was a line of licensed chocolates based on the 
      
        I Love Lucy
      
       television show.
    

      The retail concept was being modernized and upgraded to a more high-end
      feel, noted 
      
        Confectioner.
      
       By this time, there were 204 stores in the United States, plus 23 in
      Canada and two in the United Arab Emirates. Of these, only four stores in
      Colorado were company owned; all the rest were franchised. Distribution
      had expanded to home shopping channels, FAO Schwartz stores, and Costco
      warehouse clubs.
    

      In February 2002, the company introduced a 250-square-foot kiosk concept
      for areas where a traditional 1,000-square-foot shop was not feasible. The
      compact site did include a cooking area. A 125-square-foot kiosk also was
      developed. These allowed RMCF to open stores in very expensive malls.
    

      RMCF's annual revenues were $19.4 million in 2002. The company was
      opening more than two dozen stores a year. Stores cost franchisees an
      average of $175,000 each to open and were averaging $300,000 to $350,000
      in sales per year.
    


        Company Perspectives:
      


          Frank Crail had a dream to raise a family in a quiet, small town
          environment. Not having a plan to support his dream in Durango,
          Colorado, the quaint Victorian-era town in which they had chosen to
          settle, he began surveying the town's local residents and
          merchants. "It came down to either a car wash or a chocolate
          shop," recalls the father of seven. "I think I made the
          right choice." Today, a shop still stands on Main Street, with
          its sights and smells tempting tourists and locals alike to experience
          a cornucopia of chocolatey treats. …

      Emirates. 
      
        Fortune
      
       magazine dubbed RMCF one of "America's 100 Fastest-Growing
      Small Public Companies." RMCF was planning to open between 40 and
      50 units per year, an executive told CNBC.
    

      Revenues rose to $24.5 million in the fiscal year ended February 2005,
      producing net income of $3.3 million. "We were borrowing a little
      bit here, a little bit there, paying 24, 30 percent in interest rates,
      whatever it took," Crail told 
      
        Candy Industry
      
       of the RMCF's cash-strapped early days. Those days were long gone
      by June 2005, when the company announced that it had paid off all of its
      outstanding debt and had another $2 million in the bank.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Franklin Crail, CEO. Mr. Crail?
Franklin Crail
Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory’s fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 year end conference call. I am Frank Crail, President of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. And with me here today is Mr. Bryan Merryman, the company’s Chief Operating Officer.
We are going to start the call this afternoon with Bryan giving you a summary of both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 year end operating results. And at the conclusion of his presentation, we will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
So at this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Bryan.
Bryan Merryman
Thanks, Frank. I would also like to welcome everyone to today’s call and I will start with the fiscal year. Total revenues decreased 5.3% this year versus last year. Factory revenues decreased 3.5% due primarily to a 5.6% decrease in shipments to customers outside of our network of franchised stores and to a lesser extent, a 4.7% decrease in same-store pounds purchased by our franchisees and licensees and a decline of 3% in the average number of domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores in operation. Retail sales were down 11%. This was due to the sale of a certain company-owned location and the closure of an underperforming company-owned location. Same-store sales at all company-owned stores and cafés increased 0.5%.
Royalty and marketing fees were down 5.3%. This was a 12.3% decrease in franchised units. Same-store sales at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores increased 0.9%, while same-store sales at domestic U-Swirl franchised cafés declined 3%. Total same-store domestic franchise sales across all brands decreased 0.2%. Franchise fees decreased 40.8%. We had international license fees in the prior year of $263,000, with only $9,000 in the current year. Factory margins decreased 270 basis points. This was due to maintenance, equipment issues, increased cost of labor and overhead and it was slightly offset by a decrease in certain commodities. Excluding retail expenses, operating expenses decreased 8.9% on lower G&A expense and lower franchise costs.

Adjusted EBITDA was $7,459,000 versus $8,223,000 last year. Net income for the year was $3,450,000 compared to $4,426,000 last year. Diluted earnings per share for the year was $0.58 compared to $0.73 in the prior year. During the year, we opened 40 stores, 8 Cold Stone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory co-branded stores, 4 domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory standalone stores, 22 international locations and 5 domestic U-Swirl locations and 1 international U-Swirl location.
We finished the quarter with $5.8 million in cash, a current ratio of 1.9:1. During the year, we repurchased 35,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of approximately $10. And on March 10, 2017, the company paid its 55th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to shareholders in the amount of $0.12 per share. During the first quarter, we acquired certain assets of two small confectionery companies, FernCreek Confections and Elaine’s Toffee Company. These acquisitions allowed us to acquire an all-natural gluten-free line of products and a high-end toffee line and also expanding our customer relationships.
On the quarter, total revenues decreased 5.9%. Factory revenues were down 6.3% primarily due to 11.3% decrease in same-store pounds purchased by our franchisees and licensees, partially offset by a 2.7% increase in shipments to customers outside our network of franchised and licensed stores. Retail sales decreased 9.2%. Again, this was the result of a closing of the underperforming company location and the sale of certain company-owned locations. Same-store sales at all company-owned stores and cafés decreased 4% in the fourth quarter.
Royalty and marketing fees decreased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. This was due to a 14.4% decrease in domestic franchised units. Same-store sales at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores decreased 3.9%, while same-store sales at domestic U-Swirl franchised cafés declined 7.6%. Total same-store domestic franchise sales across all brands were down 4.6% in the quarter. Franchise fees decreased 20%. Fewer domestic U-Swirl locations opened this year versus last year. Factory margins were down 920 basis points, again on increased labor and overhead costs related to maintenance and equipment issues and a product mix shift, partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain commodities.
Excluding retail operating expenses, operating expenses decreased 9.9% in the quarter on lower G&A and franchise costs. Adjusted EBITDA was $1,636,000 versus $2,183,000 last year in the fourth quarter. Net income was $732,000 this year versus $2,422,000 last year. In the fourth quarter last year, a very large tax benefit was recorded and that’s why there is such a dramatic swing in net income. Diluted earnings per share, was $0.12 in the quarter compared to $0.41 in the prior year.
During the quarter, we opened 8 stores, 2 Cold Stone Creamery co-branded stores, 4 international Rocky Mountain locations and 2 domestic Rocky Mountain locations. We finished the quarter with $5.8 million in cash, current ratio of 1.9:1. And again, we paid our 55th consecutive quarterly cash dividend to shareholders in the amount of $0.12 per share.
And with that, I will turn it back over to Frank.
Franklin Crail
Thanks, Bryan. Okay, operator, at this time, we’d be happy to answer any questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bryan London, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Bryan London
Yes. I asked a couple of conference calls ago and I just wanted to follow-up and see if you had any more color on selling candy bars or the tote bags to the grocery stores?
Bryan Merryman
Our sales – our wholesale sales to larger retail chains were down significantly this year over last year. I think we actually performed pretty well, but we weren’t able to keep a lot of the shelf space that was allocated to us and it was never a really large number in terms of revenues. But that business is down and I can tell you in the future, we will be really trying a more regional approach as opposed to a national approach with chains like Target. I think that we will more look to retail on more regional players to move our product and continue to grow with our existing partners outside of our stores.

Bryan London
Okay. Yes, I had – I live in California. And I noticed the tote bag from Target for a little while. And I know this is a little anecdotal, I noticed Ghirardelli and Lindt with similar-sized tote bags were selling for $3 or $4 each and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory ones were selling for $6 each. And I was also wondering if you guys have any kind of leverage or control over the price or maybe if you guys are having – are you faced with slotting fees with – when you go to the grocery stores, just kind of curious about any kind of feedback in terms of that?
Bryan Merryman
Well, we don’t. I mean, we certainly don’t have any pricing power. I mean, those kind of retailers dictate prices. Our cost structure and our product quality is such that we are not going to compete with Lindt and Ghirardelli and the other big players that have the lion’s share of shelf space. I think there’s the opportunity to get rotated in and be in for a period of time, and then you get replaced with another specialty chocolatier. And so you can be in and out of these retailers. But to get a permanent shelf space allocation, as you would say, requires slotting fees. We don’t do that, and we just don’t have the cost structure to compete on price.
Bryan London
Correct. Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Luebke of Summit Brokerage. Please go ahead.
David Luebke
Hi. My question, you had the machinery maintenance and equipment issues in the fourth quarter, would that be a one-time event or not?
Bryan Merryman
Well, actually, it – we had issues in our factory around maintenance and equipment. And in the first quarter, we were way down with sales to a particular large customer, and those problems really plagued us all year. It was the worst in the fourth quarter. We made the decision that we were going to get the product out and we were going to get it to our customers no matter what. So we spent way more on labor and overhead than we typically do. We have seen a nice improvement in March and April, do not expect those fourth quarter trends to continue into next year and would expect pretty good margin improvement next year over this year. We have worked, I wouldn’t say through all of the issues but most of them. And we will be investing heavily in maintenance and equipment this year as well. And so I don’t foresee any of the kind of large issues that we have this year. I think we will have another year of investment, and the factory will, I think, be in tiptop shape by the end of this next fiscal year, and we have already seen an improvement.
David Luebke
Okay. And as far as other expenses, costs, I see where dairy farmers can hardly give away milk, and the price of cocoa was – has dropped a lot, too. Is that affecting your cost structure yet or is that going to take a while?
Bryan Merryman
Well, I mean, it has helped. Unfortunately, we have other costs that are growing, and that has certainly helped us. Unfortunately, cocoa butter hasn’t come down to the extent like the cocoa contract has and sugar and some nuts. So we are definitely benefiting from lower commodity costs, and we should see – again, we shouldn’t have the recurring issues that we have this last fiscal year. We will see margin improvements from that, and we should also see some margin improvement from commodities as well. It’s not going to be huge, but I do expect that we will have incrementally better margins than we did in fiscal 2016.
David Luebke
Okay thanks. I have one more question, but I can wait.
Bryan Merryman
No, you go ahead. You don’t have to get back in queue.
David Luebke
Well, any outlook on the dividend increase, decrease, stay the same?
Bryan Merryman
I think that if the company executes, it can grow this fiscal year. Again, I think we are off to a good start and put a couple of well-executed quarters behind it. I think we would be in a position to consider a dividend increase, but I think we are going to have to see execution in our business for a few more quarters before we do.

David Luebke
Okay, thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vincent Rudisill, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.
Vincent Rudisill
Thank you. My question is looking longer term the company has kind of been plodding along for a number of years now. You just spoke about the dividend, and most quarters, you are covering the dividend as presumably that’s going to be maintained and possibly increased, as you mentioned. But other than paying dividends and occasionally repurchasing stock, what’s the long-term vision for the company? I guess stated another way, if we were to look back 5 years from now, what in particular should we as shareholders look to, to measure whether or not the goals for the company were achieved? Thank you.
Bryan Merryman
I think longer term, we need to open more domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchised stores, and we have been evaluating a number of ways to help that happen. And I think that’s critical to our future. Over the last 5 years, we have not been opening as much domestically as we would like. We have had some international success, some ups and down, but had some success growing there. And so I think we need to accelerate our domestic franchise openings for sure. We need to continue to grow our sales outside of our system. This year was definitely a setback, and for the first time in a number of years, specialty market sales, as we term them, are down this year over last year. It’s the first time that that’s happened in the last 5 years. We would expect going forward that we would see year-over-year increases there. We would like to see, just like I said, an acceleration in domestic franchise openings, continued international growth. But we definitely need to get the company’s top line going, and we are doing everything we can to try to make that happen.
Vincent Rudisill
Okay thank you. And I mean, are there any metrics that you are using to have long-term goals that are possibly related to compensation, bonuses and so forth? Do you use metrics of any sort other than just indicating you would like to open more franchised stores? Again, I am kind of trying to understand where you want to take the company longer term.
Bryan Merryman
Well, we don’t – I mean, what we have disclosed is what we disclose. We don’t disclose anything else than what we have disclosed in our filings. And those are – you can find metrics on the company in our filings. But of course, we would like to grow our same-store sales. That’s important to us. We would like to see unit growth. We don’t talk about it super specifically. We don’t do – we don’t give guidance. And so I am not sure I can give you the detail that you are looking for in terms of what we disclose and what we are willing to disclose. But we would like to see the company expand internationally, would like to see it expand domestically. And we would like to continue to grow our sales profitably outside of our system. We would like to see rockymountainchocolatefactory.com play a larger role in sales going forward. Our franchise system had rmcf.com really until this last year. It was our first year with it. We saw large increases in sales there. We would like to continue to grow that and see it grow rapidly at least in terms of percentages. And so that’s as specific as I can get for you, and that’s my answer.
Vincent Rudisill
Okay thank you.
Operator
We show no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Crail for any closing remarks.
Franklin Crail

Hello and welcome to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Incorporated Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
The statements made on this conference call which are not historical facts or forward-looking based upon the company’s current plan and strategies and reflect the company’s current assessment of the risks and uncertainties related to its business including such things as product demand and market acceptance, the economic and business environment and the impact of government pressures, currency risks, capacity, efficiency and supply constraints and other risks detailed in the company’s press releases, shareholder communication and Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
For additional information the company urges you to consider reviewing its 10-Q and 10-K SEC filings.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Frank Crail, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Franklin Crail
Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory’s fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 year-end conference call. I’m Frank Crail, President of Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory. And with me here today is Mr. Bryan Merryman, the company’s Chief Operating Officer.
We’re going to start the call today with Bryan giving you a summary of both our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 year-end operating results. And at the conclusion of this presentation we’ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. So at this time, I’d like to turn the call over to Bryan.
Bryan Merryman
Thank you, Frank. I’d also like to welcome everyone to today’s call. I’m going to start with details on operating results from the year-ended 2016, February 29, and then get into a little detail on the fourth quarter. Then I’ll turn the conference back over to Frank for question-and-answers.
Total revenues for the year declined 2.5% from $41.5 million last year to $40.5 million this year. This was driven by factory sales increase of 1.8%, primarily due to 8.1% increase in shipments to customers outside of our network of domestic franchised and licensed stores. This increase was partially offset by lower domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores in operation and a 1.5% decline in same store pounds purchased.
Royalty and marketing fees decreased 3.1%. We had a decline in domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory units in operation of 5.3%. And we also had a decline of 11.1% in total franchised units in operations, the result of store closures and acquired yogurt franchise systems, in line with expectations that poor performing stores would close.
We had fewer acquisitions and store openings this year to offset these declining units. We also had a system-wide same-store sale increase of 0.7%. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores’ same-store sales were up 1.6% and our yogurt stores declined on a same-store sales basins 1.4%.
Franchise fees decreased 6.5%, due to fewer international license fees. Retail sales declined 19.4%; this was the result of the sale of three U-Swirl locations and the closure of two underperforming U-Swirl company-owned locations. We also sold two Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory company-owned locations. We had a 0.8% decrease in company-owned stores’ same-store retail sales.

Factory adjusted margins decreased 140 basis points. This was the result of a change in customer and product mix resulting from the addition of new customers and products outside our system of franchised and licensed locations. We also saw a higher commodity prices, particularly in the first six months of the year with a little of abatement in the second-half of the year, but still pressured our margins.
Adjusted EBITDA for the year was $8.223 million versus $9.014 million in the prior year. Income from operations decreased 37.8% in fiscal year 2016 to approximately $3.7 million compared with $6 million a year earlier. The decrease in operating income resulted from charges related to the impairment of goodwill and certain company-owned long-lived assets of U-Swirl.
Pretax income declined 38.7% to $3.545 million in fiscal 2016 versus $5,781 million in the previous fiscal year. The company recognized an income tax benefit of $262,000 in fiscal year 2016, compared with an effective tax rate of 35.3% and an expense of $2.038 million in fiscal year 2015. An income tax benefit of approximately $2.140 million was recognized during fourth quarter, as the result of the company foreclosing upon its interest in U-Swirl and recognizing tax assets reserved for when U-Swirl was a separate tax entity.
RMCF will consolidate U-Swirl in future tax returns, and consequently with tax assets that were fully reserved for previously now had their valuation allowances reversed.
Net income was approximately $4.426 million compared to $3.938 million in the previous fiscal year. The difference between the decrease in operating income and the increase in income attributable to RMCF shareholders was primarily due to a $2.327 million charge for impairment of goodwill and certain long-lived company store assets, more than offset by income tax benefit of $2.149 million.
Of the impairment charge of $2.327 million, 61% of that is absorbed by the non-controlling interest in U-Swirl. Fully diluted earnings-per-share was $0.73 versus $0.61 in the prior year. On March 11, the company paid its 51st consecutive quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share. During the year, we continued to repurchase shares, buying approximately 233,000 shares or 3.9% of the shares outstanding.
We opened 40 new locations in fiscal 2016, including 11 U-Swirl locations, 10 Cold Stone Creamery locations and 14 international locations, as well as 5 domestic standalone Rocky Mount Chocolate Factory openings.
On February 29, 2016, the company foreclosed on its loan with U-Swirl, Inc, the company’s 39% owned subsidiary, due to defaults and non-payment by SWRL. As a result of the foreclosure, U-Swirl International, Inc., which contains all of the franchise and other operating assets of U-Swirl, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company.
Earlier today the company announced that its 52nd consecutive quarterly cash dividend will be paid on June 7, 2016 in the amount of $0.12 per share. For the quarter, total revenues decreased 1.4% from $11.2 million to $11 million. Factory revenues increased 0.6%; this was driven by 2.9% increase in shipments to customers outside our system of franchised stores.
Retail sales declined 12.2%; this was the result of the sale of three U-Swirl locations and the closure of two under-performing U-Swirl company-owned locations. We also sold a Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory company-owned location in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter same-store sales at all company-owned locations increased to 3.2%. Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores increased 3% and U-Swirl stores increased 3.5%.
Royalty and marketing fees decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter. This was driven by a decline of 9.5% in the total franchised units in operation, the result of store closures and acquired franchise systems for the yogurt.

Franchise fees decreased 2.2% in the fourth quarter, primarily as the result of higher international license fees in the prior-year quarter, with no such fees occurring in the current year quarter.
Factory margins decreased 50 basis points in the fourth quarter to 21.8% - 28.1% versus 28.6%. This resulted from a change in customer and product mix, resulting from the addition of new customers and products outside our system of franchised and licensed locations. It was partially offset by a slight decline in certain commodity costs in the fourth quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was $2,183,000 in the fourth quarter versus $2,242,000 in the fourth quarter of last year. Net income was approximately $2,442,000 compared with $1,387,000. Fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.41 versus $0.22 last year. We opened 11 new locations in the fourth quarter, including two U-Swirl locations, four co-branded Cold Stone locations, and five international openings. We finished the quarter with $6.2 million in cash and current ratio of 1.9 to 1.
And that’s - with that, I’ll turn it back over to Frank for any questions that you may have.
Franklin Crail
Okay. Thanks, Bryan. Operator, at this time, we’d be happy to answer any questions that anyone might have.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tim Call with Capital Management Group. Please go ahead.
Timothy Call
Congratulations with growing your system-wide chocolate store base, but sequentially in year-over-year. What’s the outlook for international chocolate store growth today, and has the bank lending environment eased at all for Cold Stone Creamery co-branding opportunities to grow?
Franklin Crail
I believe that we’ll see continued international growth opportunities and see more international openings and we do have domestically. I believe also that on a longer-term basis. International would be a contributor to our profitability long-term. We don’t expect it to move the needle in the short-term, but I still see faster growth international than we’ll see domestically.
And what was the second part of your question? I’m sorry.
Timothy Call
The lending environment for Cold Stone Creamery stores to have moved to co-branded with Rocky Mountain?
Franklin Crail
I’m not sure the lending environment really was an impediment to growth in terms of Cold Stone Creamery stores, remodeling their stores, so that become a co-branded Cold Stone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory store. I think that’s more applicable to standalone Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores. And I think, well, that lending environment is somewhat not much for the kind of franchise that we attract.
Timothy Call
What are the expansion opportunities for things like candy bars serial and internet sales?
Franklin Crail
Well, I think the candy bars serials, we have less opportunities going right now, then we do with the ability of expand our online sales to Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory or rmcf.com. I think there is a great opportunity for that, I think that in our plans for the fiscal year that we are in right now is to grow that business significantly. From a small base, but still grow at significantly. We won’t really know how successful we are with those efforts until Q3, Q4. That business will be a gifting business and we’ll be seasonal like most chocolate sales.
Timothy Call
Thank you.
Operator
The next question is a follow-up from Tim Call with Capital Management Group. Please go ahead.
Timothy Call
I just had a couple of more questions. The interest expenses here fell around 17%, because you’re paying off your promissory note as it comes due. As that continues, should we expect interest expense this coming up year to also fall around 17% or more?

Bryan Merryman
I think it will be approximately in that range, yes. And we’ll continue to pay that down in interest expense, will continue to go down.
Timothy Call
And you expect to pay down debt as it comes due?
Bryan Merryman
Yes, that’s our plan. It’s not to pay that down, that debt, any earlier than it is due.
Timothy Call
In the balance sheet, cash is almost twice the level of current liabilities and your free cash flow remains very strong. Does that mean there is a chance later on this year that you might increase the annual dividend beyond $0.48 and are share buyback still a possibility.
Bryan Merryman
Well, I’ll answer that question this way. We have and we will continue to pay dividends, buy back stock, invest in the business within the constraints of the cash flow, that’s generated by operations. So, specifically, we don’t have plans to increase the dividend and that’s going to depend on whether we grow earnings and free cash flow and what the level of investment we’re going to make in our factory. And so, that is not a given, but it is something that we continually look at.
Timothy Call
Thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from Vincent Rudisill, [ph] a private investor. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. Could you tell us what your long-term debt was on the balance sheet at the end of the fiscal year?
Bryan Merryman
It was roughly $4.1 million total long-term debt and that is the current long-term purchase [ph].
Unidentified Analyst
And I believe you were owed $7 million from U-Swirl. What is - what happens with that?
Bryan Merryman
The note that was between U-Swirl, Inc. and Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, because we consolidated U-Swirl was eliminated in consolidation. And that note has been satisfied through the foreclosure process. And so, that note is no longer in existence.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, all right. Thank you.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Bill Wolfenden with Cottonwood Investments. Please go ahead.
Bill Wolfenden
Hi, I have a couple of big-picture questions. The first one is, if you could just talk broadly why the same-store sales were so strong in the fourth quarter? And secondly, what are the plans for U-Swirl, because obviously that business wasn’t doing that well yet to foreclose on it, so I’m just trying to figure out how that fits into your business.
Franklin Crail
Well, I think U-Swirl continues to fit into our business. It’s not too dissimilar from Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory’s franchise system in terms of the infrastructure that you need to support those franchisees. It’s a contributor in terms of cash flow. And through the foreclosure process we got access to $3.3 million in cash and almost $2.2 million in tax assets.
And so, I think it fits into what we’re doing. And hopefully at some point, we’ll see more units opening and closing as we get through the process of closing the weaker stores and we see a less saturated frozen yogurt market nationally. So that’s the U-Swirl question. And I think that the fourth quarter same-store sales; there is no new trend there. They were up slightly on the year; they did better in the fourth quarter than they had on year.
But if you look at the year number, on same-store sales, it’s much weaker than last year, but in line with the previous four years. And so, I don’t think there is any new trend in same-store sales. We had four years of slightly positive same-stores sales, in one year our same-store sales were very strong.
Bill Wolfenden
Great, and if I can just follow-up, is the cash flow profile, i.e., margins et cetera for U-Swirl similar to that of Rocky Mountain or is it lower?
Franklin Crail
Well, on the Rocky Mountain side or on the U-Swirl side we don’t purchase the product, that’s purchased by the franchise system. So the revenue that’s generated per store is much lower in the yogurt business than it is in the chocolate business.

Bill Wolfenden
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Frank Crail for any closing remarks.
Franklin Crail
Thank you. And I’d like to thank everyone that listen to our conference call this afternoon and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of the first quarter. Have a great day and thank you again. Bye.
