Important Disclosures and Requirements
+ Show All

 1 APR is the Annual Percentage Rate. Advertised rates depend on the individual's credit and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the Amount Financed, term, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80%, and other vehicle characteristics. A representative example of payment terms are as follows: an Amount Financed of $25,000 with an APR of 7.50% and a term of 60 months would have a monthly payment of $500.95. APRs shown are current as of April 20, 2017. Advertised rates are subject to change without notice.
Advertised 3.24% APR is offered depending on the individual’s excellent and substantial credit, and key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, a term less than or equal to 60 months, a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of less than or equal to 80% and a new vehicle. Your actual APR will be based on your specific situation.
2 Yearly Payment reduction claim is based on average payment reduction our customers experience over a year with their new loan (same or a longer term) compared to their prior yearly loan payments. Yearly payment reduction may result from a lower interest rate, a longer term or both. Your actual savings may be different.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

The Receivables existing in the Initial Accounts at the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off Date and thereafter arising in the Initial Accounts on or prior to the Closing Date, and the related Purchased Assets, shall be sold by Capital One and purchased by Funding on the Closing Date. Receivables arising after the Closing Date in the Initial Accounts and the related Purchased Assets shall be sold by Capital One and purchased by Funding on the date such Receivables arise. The Receivables existing in Additional Accounts at the close of business on the related Additional Cut-Off Date and thereafter arising in such Additional Accounts on or prior to the related Addition Date, and the related Purchased Assets, shall be sold by Capital One and purchased by Funding on the related Addition Date. Receivables arising after such Addition Date in such Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets shall be sold by Capital One and purchased by Funding on the date such Receivables arise. (b) Capital One shall (i) record and file, at its own expense, any financing statements (and amendments with respect to such financing statements when applicable) with respect to the Purchased Assets meeting the requirements of applicable state law in such manner and in such jurisdictions as are necessary to perfect, and maintain perfection of, the Conveyance of such Purchased Assets from Capital One to Funding, (ii) cause such financing statements and amendments to name Capital One, as seller, and Funding, as purchaser, of the Purchased Assets and (iii) deliver a file-stamped copy of such financing statements or amendments or other evidence of such filings to Funding as soon as is practicable after filing. (c) Capital One shall, at its own expense, (i) on or prior to (x) the Closing Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and (y) the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, indicate in its books and records (including its computer files) that Receivables created in connection with such Accounts and the related Purchased Assets have been sold to Funding in accordance with this Agreement and have been conveyed by Funding to the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (ii) on or prior to the Closing Date, in the case of Initial Accounts, and on or prior to the applicable Addition Date, in the case of Additional Accounts, deliver to Funding an Account Schedule (provided that such Account Schedule shall be provided in respect of Additional Accounts designated pursuant to Subsection DOCSDC1:12 2.02(a)(ii) on or prior to the Determination Date immediately succeeding the related Monthly Period during which their respective Addition Dates occur) containing a true and complete list of all such Accounts. Capital One shall not alter the indication referenced in clause (i) of this paragraph with respect to any Account during the term of this Agreement unless and until such Account is no longer an Account or Capital One has taken such action as is necessary or advisable to cause the interest of Funding in the Purchased Assets to continue to be perfected and of first priority. The Account Schedules, as supplemented and amended, collectively shall be marked as Schedule 1 to this Agreement and shall be updated by Capital One on each Addition Date (or with respect to Additional Accounts designated pursuant to Subsection 2.02(a)(ii), on or prior to the Determination Date immediately succeeding the related Monthly Period during which their respective Addition Dates occur), but not later than on a quarterly basis to include any new Related Accounts. (d) The parties hereto intend that the conveyance of Capital One s right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets shall constitute an absolute sale, conveying good title free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances or rights of others, from Capital One to Funding. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the arrangements with respect to the Purchased Assets shall constitute a purchase and sale of such Purchased Assets and not a loan, including for accounting purposes. In the event, however, that it were to be determined that the transactions evidenced hereby constitute a loan and not a purchase and sale, it is the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law, and that Capital One shall be deemed to have granted, and Capital One does hereby grant, to Funding a first priority perfected security interest in all of Capital One s right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Purchased Assets to secure the obligations of Capital One hereunder. (e) To the extent that Capital One retains any interest in the Purchased Assets, Capital One hereby grants to the Trustee a security interest in all of Capital One s right, title and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and under the Purchased Assets, to secure the performance of all of the obligations of Capital One hereunder and under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. With respect to such security interest and such collateral, the Trustee shall have all of the rights that it has under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Trustee shall also have all of the rights of a secured creditor under the UCC. (f) Capital One hereby acknowledges and agrees to perform its obligations under Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. Section Addition of Accounts. (a) (i) If, from time to time, Funding (A) becomes obligated to designate Additional Accounts pursuant to Subsection 2.08(a) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, or (B) elects to designate Additional Accounts pursuant to Subsection 2.08(b) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then in either case Funding may, at its option, give Capital One written notice thereof on or before the eighth Business Day prior to the Addition Date therefor, and upon receipt of such notice Capital One shall on or before the Addition Date, designate sufficient Eligible Accounts to be included as Additional Accounts as requested by Funding. DOCSDC1:13 (ii) Additionally, Capital One may, at its option and with the consent of Funding, designate newly originated Eligible Accounts to be included as Additional Accounts. (b) On the Addition Date with respect to any designation of Additional Accounts, such Additional Accounts shall become Accounts, and Funding shall purchase Capital One s right, title and interest in, to and under the Receivables in such Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets as provided in Section 2.01, subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions on such Addition Date: (i) Capital One shall have delivered to Funding copies of UCC financing statements covering such Additional Accounts, if necessary to perfect Funding s interest in the Receivables arising therein and the related Purchased Assets; (ii) as of each of the Additional Cut-Off Date and the Addition Date, no Insolvency Event with respect to Capital One shall have occurred nor shall the sale of the Receivables arising in the Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets to Funding have been made in contemplation of the occurrence thereof; (iii) Capital One shall have delivered to Funding an Officer s Certificate of Capital One, dated the Addition Date, to the effect that (A) Capital One reasonably believes that such addition will not, based on the facts known to such officer at the time of such certification, then cause a Pay Out Event under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or any event to occur that, after the giving of notice or the lapse of time would constitute a Pay Out Event under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and (B) in the case of Additional Accounts, no selection procedure was utilized by Capital One that would result in a selection of Additional Accounts (from the available Eligible Accounts owned by Capital One) that would be materially adverse to the interests of Funding as of the date of the addition; (iv) Capital One shall have indicated in its computer files that Receivables created in connection with such Additional Accounts and the related Purchased Assets have been sold to Funding and shall have delivered to Funding the Account Schedule with respect to such Additional Accounts (in the case of Additional Accounts designated pursuant to Subsection 2.02(a)(i)); (v) Capital One and Funding shall have entered into a duly executed, written assignment, substantially in the form of Exhibit A (the Supplemental Conveyance ); and (vi) Capital One shall have delivered to Funding an Officer s Certificate of Capital One, dated the Addition Date, confirming, to the extent applicable, the items set forth in clauses (i) through (v) above. Section Removal and Deletion of Accounts. (a) If an Account becomes a Removed Account, then Capital One shall stop selling to Funding Principal Receivables arising in such Removed Account effective on the Business Day (the Stop Date ) after the date such Account becomes a Removed Account. Notwithstanding the cessation of the sale to Funding of additional Principal Receivables arising DOCSDC1:14 in such Removed Account, Principal Receivables sold to Funding prior to the Stop Date, Funds Collateral and Collections in respect of such Principal Receivables, Finance Charge Receivables whenever created that accrue in respect of such Principal Receivables, and Funds Collateral and Collections in respect of such Finance Charge Receivables, shall continue to be property of Funding available for transfer by Funding to the Trustee pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. To the extent that it is not clear to Capital One whether collections or funds collateral relate to a Principal Receivable that was sold to Funding or to a principal receivable that Capital One did not sell to Funding, Capital One shall allocate payments and funds collateral on each such Removed Account with respect to the principal balance of such Removed Account first to the oldest principal balance of such Removed Account. (b) On and after the Stop Date for a Removed Account, Capital One may mark its books and records to indicate that such Account is a Removed Account, but Capital One shall not (i) alter the indication referenced in clause (i) of Subsection 2.01(c) with respect to such Removed Account unless and until such Account becomes a Deleted Account or Capital One has taken such action as is necessary or advisable to cause the interest of Funding in the Purchased Assets to continue to be perfected and of first priority, or (ii) delete such Removed Account from Schedule 1 hereto or any Account Schedule. (c) Once a Removed Account becomes a Deleted Account, Capital One shall promptly delete such Deleted Account from Schedule 1 hereto and shall indicate in its computer files that such Deleted Account is no longer an Account. [END OF ARTICLE II] DOCSDC1:15 ARTICLE III CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT Section Purchase Price. (a) The Purchase Price for the Receivables in the Initial Accounts existing at the close of business on the Initial Cut-Off Date, and the related Purchased Assets, that are conveyed to Funding under this Agreement shall be payable in cash on the Closing Date in an amount equal to the fair market value of such Receivables and the related Purchased Assets as mutually agreed upon by Capital One and Funding. This computation of initial purchase price shall assume no reinvestment in new Receivables. The Purchase Price for the Receivables (including Receivables in Additional Accounts) and the related Purchased Assets conveyed to Funding under this Agreement which come into existence after the Initial Cut-Off Date (i) shall be payable on a date (the Purchase Price Payment Date ) mutually agreed to by Capital One and Funding, but no later than the second Business Day following the calendar month in which such Receivables and the related Purchased Assets are conveyed by Capital One to Funding and (ii) shall be an amount equal to 100% of the aggregate balance of the Principal Receivables so conveyed, adjusted to reflect such factors as Capital One and Funding mutually agree will result in a Purchase Price determined to be the fair market value of such Principal Receivables and the related Purchased Assets. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Capital One shall not be obligated to continue to sell Receivables or other Purchased Assets to Funding to the extent that Capital One is not paid the Purchase Price therefor as provided herein. Section Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be reduced on the Purchase Price Payment Date (a Purchase Price Adjustment ) with respect to any Receivable previously conveyed to Funding by Capital One which is reduced by Capital One or the Servicer because of a rebate, refund, unauthorized charge or billing error to an Obligor, other than by reason of a Servicer error. The amount of such reduction shall equal the reduction in the principal balance of such Receivable resulting from the occurrence of such event. In the event that a reduction pursuant to this Section 3.02 causes the Purchase Price to be a negative number, Capital One agrees that on the Purchase Price Payment Date, Capital One shall pay or cause to be paid to Funding an amount equal to the amount by which the Purchase Price Adjustment exceeds the unadjusted Purchase Price; provided that if the reduction relating to such Purchase Price Adjustment also gives rise to an obligation on the part of Funding as Transferor to make a deposit in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.09 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, then Capital One and Funding hereby agree that the date that Funding is required to make such deposit pursuant to Section 3.09 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement shall be a Purchase Price Payment Date. Section Use of Name, Logo and Marks. Capital One does hereby grant to Funding a non-exclusive license to use the name Capital One and all related identifying trade or service marks, signs, symbols, logos, designs, servicing software, customer lists and other intangibles in connection with the servicing of the Receivables purchased hereunder. The license granted shall be co-extensive with the term of the Agreement. [END OF ARTICLE III] DOCSDC1:16 ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES One.

Exhibit 4.1

CAPITAL ONE MASTER TRUST
FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND
RESTATED POOLING AND SERVICING
AGREEMENT

This FIRST AMENDMENT TO AMENDED AND
RESTATED POOLING AND SERVICING AGREEMENT, dated as of
January 27, 2017 (the “ Amendment ”) to the
Amended and Restated Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of
September 30, 1993, as amended and restated as of
August 1, 2002, January 13, 2006, July 1,
2007 and March 17, 2016 (the “ Agreement
”), is entered into by and among CAPITAL ONE BANK (USA),
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a national banking association (the “
Bank ”), as Servicer (the “ Servicer
”), CAPITAL ONE FUNDING, LLC, a Virginia limited liability
company (“ Funding ”), as Transferor (the
“ Transferor ”), and THE BANK OF NEW YORK
MELLON, a New York banking corporation, as the Trustee (the “
Trustee ”).

WHEREAS, pursuant to
Section 13.01 of the Agreement, the Bank and Funding desire to
amend the Agreement to include provisions related to measuring the
Transferor’s Interest (as defined in the Agreement) for the
purposes of Regulation RR (as defined below);

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the premises and agreements contained herein and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in the Agreement, the
undersigned parties hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

AMENDMENTS

Section 1.01. Amendments to
the Agreement . The Agreement is hereby amended as
follows:

(a) Amendment to
Section 1.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Section 1.01 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the
following definitions in the appropriate alphabetical
order:

“ Regulation RR ”
shall mean Part 244 – Credit Risk Retention (Regulation RR),
12 C.F.R. §§244.1-244.22, as the same may be amended from
time to time.

“ Seller’s Interest
Measurement Date ” shall have the meaning specified in
Section 13.19 .



(b) Amendment to
Article XIII of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement .
Article XIII of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is hereby
amended by adding the following Section 13.19 in the
appropriate numeric order:

Section 13.19 Measuring the
Transferor’s Interest for the Purposes of Regulation RR .
In order to facilitate Capital One’s obligation to comply
with Regulation RR, the Transferor shall, on each Seller’s
Interest Measurement Date and on the issuance date of (i) any
Investor Certificates hereunder or (ii) any Notes (as defined
in the Series 2002-CC Supplement hereto) under the Indenture (as
defined in the Series 2002-CC Supplement hereto), measure the
Transferor’s Interest in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Regulation RR. If on any Seller’s Interest
Measurement Date the amount of the Transferor Interest, when
measured in a manner consistent with the requirements of Regulation
RR, does not satisfy the requirements of Regulation RR, Capital One
shall nevertheless be deemed to be in compliance with Regulation RR
(as permitted by Regulation RR) so long as the Transferor causes
the amount of the Transferor’s Interest, when measured in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Regulation RR, to

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]
Capital One is also the 4th largest bank auto lender, with a market share of 4.2% in 2016.[10]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]
Capital One is also the 4th largest bank auto lender, with a market share of 4.2% in 2016.[10]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

Capital One Bank in Wake Village, Texas


Capital One Financial Corporation is a bank holding company specializing in credit cards, home loans, auto loans, banking and savings products headquartered in McLean, Virginia.[2]
Capital One is the eighth-largest commercial bank in the United States when ranked by assets and deposits.[4] and is ranked 9th on the list of largest banks in the United States by total assets. The bank has 755 branches[4] including 18 café style locations[5] and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked #100 on the Fortune 500,[6] #17 on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to work for list,[7] and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[2] The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s, and it is one of the largest customers of the United States Postal Service due to its direct mail credit card solicitations.[8] In 2015, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup.[9]
Capital One is also the 4th largest bank auto lender, with a market share of 4.2% in 2016.[10]

History[edit]
Monoline credit card company (1994-2004)[edit]




Capital One retail footprint


On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO[13] Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994.[14] The spinoff was concluded February 28, 1995, making Capital One fully independent.[15]
At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards.[16] This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times.[16] Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit direct to consumers.[17]
Capital One commenced operations in Canada in 1996.
Expansion into auto loans (1998-present)[edit]
In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation.[18]
In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service.[19]
In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One.[20]
The companies were combined and rebranded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003.[21]
In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement for bulk discount in mailing services.[22] The resulting three-year agreement[23] was extended in 2006.[24] In June 2008, however, Capital One had filed a complaint[25] with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement,[26] citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS.[27]
Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in September 2004.
Expansion into retail banking (2005-present)[edit]
While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers.
Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005[28] and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006,[29] which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%.[30]
In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million.[31]
During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures.[32][33][34]
In 2008, Capital One received an investment of US$3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.[35][36] On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of US$3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury.[37]
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that the understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing.[38]
In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock.[39][40][41][42]
In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for US$9 billion in cash and stock.[43] On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22.[44] The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or "Too-Big-to-Fail," performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups have argued that the acquisition is a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal.[45][46] In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct.[47] Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012,[48] and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012.[49]
In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations.[50] Capital One paid US$31.3 billion in exchange for US$28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed by May 2012.[51]
On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system.[52] However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture.[53]
In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations.[54]
In 2015, Capital One closed 186 branch locations.[55]
On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a P2P (person to person) money transfer service designed to make money transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address.[56] ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016.[57]
In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers.[58]
On July 8, 2015, Capital announced that it has acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy.[59]
In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9-billion.[60]
In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount.[61][62]
Sports marketing[edit]
Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data.[63][64] Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008.
Corporate citizenship[edit]
Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the "No Hassle Giving" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site.[65] The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that "Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal".[66] The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue.[66] Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that "... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP".[67]
Criticism and legal actions[edit]
Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services[edit]
In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card.[68] The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers.[69] This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action.[70]
Automated dialing to customers' phones[edit]
In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers’ cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.[71] It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the "prior express written consent" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013.[72]
2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits[edit]
In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to "contact you in any manner we choose", including a "personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment." It also asserted its right to "modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose."[73] Los Angeles Times writer David Lazarus commented that "Cap One has made deliberate decisions that seem intended to overreach and intimidate, confirming in the eyes of many the company's thoughtlessness and occasional ruthlessness".[74] Emily Rusch, the executive director of the California Public Interest Research Group, found the company's assertion of a right to "spoof" Caller ID particularly disturbing, saying "Now more than ever, consumers need to be able to trust companies".[73]
Capital One spokeswoman Pam Girardo responded that the company would not actually make personal visits to customers except "As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle".[73] Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to "spoof" as necessary because "sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'".[75]
Girardo told the New York Times that the company was "reviewing" the language involved. David Lazarus noted that "now that a little sunlight has been applied, the company is not as comfortable as it previously was with behaving like a total maniac. In the meantime, cardholders can make up their own minds. Do they want to believe the non-binding explanations of a company representative or the legally enforceable language that's currently in their written contracts?"[73]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
