Achilles Tendonitis — Precision Podiatry















































Achilles TendonitisDescriptionThe Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in the human body. It is located at the back of the ankle joint and can be felt as a large, cord-like structure attaching to the back of the foot. Since tendons serve to attach muscles to bone, the Achilles tendon also attaches the large calf muscles, the gastrocnemius and soleus, to the back of the heel bone, the calcaneus.The muscle mass and strength of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are greater than all of the other muscles of the lower leg combined. Therefore, the pull of these muscles on the Achilles tendon is very large since these muscles help balance the body while standing, push the body forward during walking, spring the body forward during running, and spring the body upward during jumping. Because of the large amount of stress which the Achilles tendon is subjected to during running and jumping activities, the Achilles tendon is prone to injury.The most common form of injury to the Achilles tendon is called Achilles tendonitis, which is an inflammatory condition causing pain in the Achilles tendon. Achilles tendonitis generally occurs in people who are active in sports activities. Types of sports that commonly are associated with Achilles tendonitis are basketball, tennis, running, football, soccer, volleyball and other running and jumping sports.Achilles tendonitis tends to occur more frequently in older athletes than in younger athletes. As a person ages into their thirties and especially into their forties and fifties, the ligaments and tendons of the body tend to lose some of their stretchiness and are not as strong as before. This predisposes older individuals who are active in running and jumping activities, to tendon injuries such as Achilles tendonitis. However, Achilles tendonitis can also occur in teenagers who are very active in running and jumping sports.DiagnosisAchilles tendonitis is diagnosed by a history and physical examination of the patient who describes pain at the back of the ankle with walking and/or running activities. The pain generally will be associated with an increase in running or jumping intensity or frequency. It is also often associated with a change from running in a thick heeled shoe to a thin heeled shoe, such as going from training shoes to racing flats and/or racing spikes in cross-country and/or track. The pain from Achilles tendonitis is often so severe that running is impossible and even walking is uncomfortable.During the physical examination, the podiatrist will feel and push lightly around the Achilles tendon to see if it is tender or has any irregularities in its surface. Achilles tendonitis may cause the tendon to be thickened in areas, may cause swelling of the area around the tendon, and can even feel like the tendon has a painful bump on it. In addition, the person with Achilles tendonitis will limp while barefoot, but walk more normally with heeled shoes on. X-rays are not helpful in diagnosing Achilles tendonitis but may be taken to rule-out other pathology. MRI scans are only indicated if a partial or complete rupture of the Achilles tendon is suspected by the podiatrist.TreatmentAchilles tendonitis generally responds very well to conservative treatment as long as it is diagnosed and treated early. Surgery is rarely indicated unless the Achilles tendonitis is particularly severe and chronic, or if the tendon has ruptured completely.Initially, the podiatrist may treat the Achilles tendonitis by putting heel lifts into the patient's shoes. In addition, the patient may be asked to avoid barefoot walking or walking in low-heeled shoes. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve) may also be prescribed to calm the inflammatory process in the tendon. Icing may be suggested to help decrease the inflammation and pain in the tendon. Stretching exercises for the calf muscles may also be given to the patient to help loosen the calf muscle and Achilles tendon so that the tendon is not under as much stress during normal daily walking activities. The stretching should not be done however if it causes pain in the Achilles tendon.Initially, the patient with Achilles tendonitis will be asked to modify their activities to decrease their running and jumping activities and do alternative physical activities, such as swimming, which don't put as much stress on the Achilles tendon. As the tendon starts to feel better, the podiatrist will allow a gradual return to normal running and jumping activities. If normal return to activities is not possible within a few weeks, then many times the podiatrist may additionally prescribe physical therapy and/or functional foot orthotics to help the tendon heal more rapidly. The foot orthotics generally are used during both the sports activities and walking activities to allow for more normal foot and Achilles tendon function. If the physician is concerned about a partial tear of the tendon the patient may be placed in a below the knee cast. It can take several weeks or even months for the tendon to heal depending upon the severity of the injury to the tendon. It is not uncommon for a patient to return to activities too quickly and re-injure the tendon. Careful monitoring of a return to full activity is important and the patient must have patience during this period of time.DisclaimerIt is important for you to understand that the information provided is of a basic educational nature only, and does not constitute medical advice nor should it replace a medical consultation or the advice of your doctor.Precision Podiatry has made and will continue to make efforts to include accurate and current information on this website, however, we are not responsible for any errors or omissions in the material provided, or any results obtained from the use of such material.

Plantar Fasciitis — Precision Podiatry















































Plantar FasciitisDescriptionPlantar fasciitis is an inflammation of a thick, fibrous ligament in the arch of the foot called the plantar fascia. The plantar fascia attaches into the heel bone and fans out toward the ball of the foot, attaching into the base of the toes. If this ligament is stretched excessively, it will become inflamed and begin to cause pain. In severe instances, the ligament can rupture resulting in immediate severe pain. If the ligament ruptures, the pain is so great that the patient can not place weight on the foot. Should this happen, the foot should be elevated and an ice pack applied. An appointment with your foot doctor should be made at your earliest convenience. Sports such as tennis, racket ball, and aerobics can cause extreme tension on the plantar fascia resulting in small tears or rupture of the ligament. However, other less stressful activities can result in tears or rupture of the plantar fascia under the right set of circumstances. One consequence of small tears in the plantar fascia is the formation of firm nodules within the plantar fascia, called fibromas.DiagnosisTaking a through history of the course of the condition and physical exam makes the diagnosis of plantar fasciitis.TreatmentTreatment of plantar fasciitis is similar to that for heel pain. Cortisone injections, used in the treatment of heel pain, are not commonly used for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. The main emphasis of treatment is to reduce the forces that are causing the plantar fascia to stretch excessively. This includes calf muscle stretching, over-the-counter arch supports, and oral anti-inflammatory medicine may be useful in controlling the pain.DisclaimerIt is important for you to understand that the information provided is of a basic educational nature only, and does not constitute medical advice nor should it replace a medical consultation or the advice of your doctor.Precision Podiatry has made and will continue to make efforts to include accurate and current information on this website, however, we are not responsible for any errors or omissions in the material provided, or any results obtained from the use of such material.

Haglund's Deformity — Precision Podiatry















































Hagland's DeformityDescriptionThe common cause of a painful bump on the back of the heel is called Hagland's deformity. This is due to an enlarged bony prominence on the back of the heel. It can involve the entire back of the heel or just a portion of the back of the heel, usually on the outside portion of the heel. Also called the Pump Bump, it is most common in women and is frequently a result of pressure from the back of the shoe. As the shoe rubs on the back of the heel bone it begins to swell and enlarge. Quite often a bursa will form. A bursa is sack that is created over any bony promance when excessive pressure or friction to the areas occurs. Bursa can be filled with a thick watery like fluid.Treatment of Hagland's Deformity and Pump BumpsTreatment consists of removing the pressure and avoiding shoes, which rub on the back of the heel. Orthotics, custom molded shoe inserts, can be useful because they reduce the rocking motion side-to-side of the heel while walking which aggravates the painful area. Cortisone injections can temporarily reduce the pain or eliminate the pain. Surgery can be the treatment of choice if other means to reduce the pressure are unsuccessful.Spurring in the Achilles tendonClosely related to Hagland's deformity is an enlargement that can occur on the back of the heel that is a result of the formation of a large spur where the Achilles tendon attaches. Treatment is the same as with the Hagland's deformity except that the surgical procedure to remove the spurring is more complex and has a longer recovery period.Achilles TendonitisSwelling and lumps can also occur in the Achilles tendon just above its attachment into the heel bone. Termed Achilles tendonitis, this occurs when there is a tear in the tendon. If this goes untreated the tendon is at risk of rupturing. Treatment consists of immobilization with a cast, possibly crutches to take weight off the foot, oral anti-inflammatory drugs and if severe of surgery. Once the area is healed aggressive physical therapy and calf muscle stretching exercises. There is another small tendon that attaches in the back of the heel that can become injured. It is called the Plantaris tendon. This tendon can tear or rupture during exercise. It is associated with a sudden onset of pain during exercise and mimics Achilles tendonitis.An Uncommon Cause - XanthomasAn uncommon cause of small lumps in the Achilles tendon, called Xanthomas, is due to an excessively high cholesterol level in the blood stream. This is a hereditary disorder that results in the deposition of cholesterol in the Achilles tendon. This is a serious condition and requires aggressive treatment by a physician to lower the cholesterol levels. Left untreated the high cholesterol levels can lead to premature heart attach and death.DisclaimerIt is important for you to understand that the information provided is of a basic educational nature only, and does not constitute medical advice nor should it replace a medical consultation or the advice of your doctor.Precision Podiatry has made and will continue to make efforts to include accurate and current information on this website, however, we are not responsible for any errors or omissions in the material provided, or any results obtained from the use of such material.

Jeff is a Shareholder and Director in Cohen & Grigsby’s Litigation Group. He is a graduate of Washington & Jefferson College and the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Jeff’s practice is diverse, ranging from all types of personal injury litigation to complex commercial litigation, including shareholder disputes, partnership disputes, insurance coverage, software and hardware suitability cases, and breach of contract cases. Jeff is a member of the prestigious Million Dollar Advocates Forum, having achieved numerous multi-million recoveries for his clients. Jeff has a Martindale-Hubbell rating of “AV,” the highest ratings for legal ability and ethical standards. He has been listed in The Best Lawyers in America for more than 10 consecutive years for Commercial Litigation, and has also been selected to the Pennsylvania Super Lawyers list for Personal Injury Litigation and Trusts and Estates Litigation.
Jeff has successfully litigated cases for over 30 years. He has tried numerous cases, including both bench and jury trials. Notable cases include a multi-million dollar jury verdict in a business fraud case, including a multi-million dollar punitive damage award; one of the first known jury verdicts in federal court for tortious interference with prospective contract; and over $50 million in recoveries for injured plaintiffs. He has litigated cases in many jurisdictions from California to Delaware in state and federal courts. Jeff is also admitted to the United States Court of Claims and the United States Supreme Court.
Special Experience – Corporate and Partnership Governance Issues
Recently, a significant percentage of Jeff’s practice has been devoted to issues relating to minority shareholder or partnership oppression. He has represented companies regarding such claims, as well as the individual making the claim of oppression. Jeff was lead counsel in the following representative cases, where he successfully forced a buyout of the oppressed client’s interest:

Jean Capello v. Robert Black and Tri-County Petroleum, Inc., Case No. 169 of 2004 (Court of Common Pleas, Bedford County, Pennsylvania).
Joann Peterson v. Richard Pagliara and Elizabeth Carbide Die Company, Inc., No. FD 92-006165-0003 (Court of Common Pleas, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania).

Special Experience – Insurance
Jeff has had extensive experience in insurance coverage litigation, including cases involving comprehensive general liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, fidelity, property and flood insurance, excess and worker’s compensation insurance. He has handled cases involving fires, collapsed buildings, floods, mudslides, explosions, water damage, product failures, and mold. One of his specialties is helping clients prepare detailed proofs of loss, avoiding the necessity of hiring public adjusters and giving up a percentage of the loss. He has had extensive experience with retrospective premium disputes. He has also had extensive experience with bad faith claims, both prosecuting and defending such claims. He has successfully tried bad faith cases for insurers and against insurers. Representative court opinions and references are available upon request.
