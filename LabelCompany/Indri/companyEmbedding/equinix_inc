        Gartner Report - Colocation-Based Interconnection         Increasingly, enterprises are leveraging hybrid IT to manage their enterprise resources and assets in the cloud, alongside their on-premises and colocation infrastructures. And with the expansion of hybrid IT in digital business, companies’ reliance and expectations around interconnection are also expanding.   Highlights:  Deploy data center interconnection that is as flexible and agile as your dynamic digital assets. Leveraging a data center interconnect fabric model that interconnects digital business and elevates its value.   We propose that topology, technology and design all favor building a digital business solution using colocation-based, programmable networking, which we will call ‘data center interconnect fabric,’ allowing dynamic interconnection between enterprise						peers, cloud providers, communications providers and a growing marketplace of service providers.

 Forrester Reports 


Innovative Edge Data Center Strategies for Superior Customer Experience
In today's digital economy, everyone wants instantaneous access to IT resources, applications and data. But enterprises are struggling to meet these ever-expanding expectations while delivering the best end-user experience possible. In three pivotal reports, Forrester sets a new course. In "Strategically Locate Your Next Data Center," Forrester outlines data center strategies that can help you reduce application latency, improve end-user experiences and service, and provide direct connectivity to cloud services. In "Your BT Agenda Demands a Hybrid Cloud Storage Strategy," Forrester maps out how hybrid cloud storage can help you lay the stepping stones for a clear path to a comprehensive cloud computing strategy.In “Beware the Pitfalls Within Networking for Hybrid Cloud,” Forrester highlights four methods to align your connectivity requirements to your hybrid cloud strategy.  By reimagining your data center and storage architectures -- and unlocking the power of interconnection to get closer to the right cloud services, employees, customers, partners and markets -- you can increase customer performance and accelerate your business. See what Forrester has to say.

Beware the Pitfalls Within Networking for Hybrid CloudLaying out the Full Set of Considerations for Cloud ConnectivityWhile we would all like hybrid cloud configurations to be simple and easy, the current economic, physics, and security realities result in infrastructure integration challenges that can be complex and costly to get right. Setting up the correct types of connections is crucial to meshing public cloud platforms and on-premises resources securely and with predictable quality of service. Even though standard Internet connections may have sufficed in your pilot phase of cloud use, a seamless production hybrid demands more thorough engineering. Success in fusing internal and cloud resources requires a series of interconnected discrete services that offer survivability, dynamically change with business conditions, and meet customer expectations. This report explains how infrastructure and operations (I&O) professionals can best match the various transport and connections options available for your cloud maturity level, along with overcoming some of the challenges in an environment that is relatively new and has a limited set of options.Access the Forrester Report

EQUINIX formerly know as Switch and Data is distinguished as the leading Internet exchange point in North America. Typically, customers look to EQUINIX to add scale and inter-connectivity to their networks to support increases in IP and network traffic volumes. In addition, customers use EQUINIX data center facilities to house and power their network infrastructure.

As of 08/07/2010: Plenty of space...up to 100 24"x36" cabinet space available on newly built colo on the third floor, hurry cause this won't last.  Great 24x7 Tech/Engineering support.  Conveniently located in Downtown Palo Alto surrounded with great eats and shopping.







Legendarily known as PAIX, then owned by AboveNet, now Switch and Data. It maybe a historic passage of much of the bay area and west coast's internet traffic (in addition to MAE West in SJ), it's sort of showing its age. If you're a downtown PA located business you can get ridiculously cheap fiber access to the datacenter but they dont have much space left and their cabinets are on the small side. If you have large space needs it maybe better to look elsewhere but it's hard to beat the convenience if you're downtown.

Awesome company to work at! As a company that has successfully done so many M&A deals with other smaller companies recently in the industry around the world, Equinix has a market cap bigger than the next six companies combined as a data center company. The growth can also be shown in the company's stock price.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. (Equinix), incorporated on June 22, 1998, operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT). The Company connects various companies directly to their customers and partners inside interconnected data centers. The Company operates through three segments: Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. The Company's platform Equinix, combines a global footprint of International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers, a range of interconnection solutions, ecosystems and support. Its customers include carriers, mobile and other bandwidth providers, cloud and information technology (IT) services providers, content providers, financial companies and enterprises. It provides each customer access to a choice of business partners and solutions based on their colocation, interconnection and managed IT service needs. Its colocation offerings include operations space, storage space, cabinets and power for customers' colocation needs inside Equinix's IBX data centers. Its interconnection offerings include Equinix Cloud Exchange, which enables simultaneous, direct and secure connections to multiple clouds from a single port; Equinix Performance Hub, which takes enterprise IT inside any one of its global data centers, and Equinix Data Hub, which enables secure, compliant access to business-critical data and analytics wherever users are located around the globe.Colocation and Related OfferingsThe Company's IBX data centers provide its customers with secure environments that are necessary for optimum Internet commerce interconnection. Its IBX data centers include multiple layers of physical security, cabinet space availability, on-site trained staff, dedicated areas for customer care and equipment staging, alternating current/direct current (AC/DC) power systems, and other and fault-tolerant infrastructure systems. Some specifications of offerings provided by individual IBX data centers may differ based on original facility design or market. Within its IBX data centers, customers can deploy their equipment and interconnect with a choice of networks, cloud providers or other business partners. It also provides customized solutions for customers looking to package its IBX offerings as part of their solutions. Its colocation offerings include Cabinets, Power and IBXflex.Interconnection SolutionsThe Company's interconnection solutions enable interconnection and traffic exchange between Equinix customers. Its interconnection solutions consist of Physical Cross Connect/Direct Interconnections, Equinix Internet Exchange, Equinix Metro Connect, Internet Connectivity Services and Equinix Cloud Exchange. Physical Cross Connect/Direct Interconnections are the physical link between customers and can be implemented within approximately 24 hours of request. Customers may choose to connect to and peer through the central switching fabric of its Equinix Internet Exchange, rather than purchase a direct physical cross connection. With a connection to this switch, a customer can aggregate multiple interconnects over one physical connection with multiple, linked 100-gigabit ports of capacity, instead of purchasing individual physical cross connects.The Equinix Cloud Exchange is an interconnection solution that enables direct access to multiple clouds from multiple networks around the world. Cloud Exchange provides virtualized, private direct connections that bypass the Internet to provide security with a range of bandwidth options. It allows businesses to connect to many participants (clouds, networks and enterprise customers) over a single physical port, enabling bandwidth allocation among various parties. The Equinix Cloud Exchange Portal and application programming interfaces (APIs) streamline the process of provisioning and managing connections to multiple cloud services and networks.Equinix Performance HubThe Equinix Performance Hub enables companies to securely and directly connect to public clouds, deploy a private cloud and lay the foundation of a hybrid cloud. Performance Hub solutions are extensions of a company's IT network that reside within Equinix data centers. An Equinix Performance Hub places corporate IT resources near user populations in IBX data centers connected to various networks and clouds. Performance Hub solutions can be implemented gradually, without closing or moving out of existing data centers.Equinix Data HubEquinix Data Hub is an extension of the Equinix Performance Hub framework and is a data center solution for enterprises offering real-time analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), data collection and data protection. Data Hub use cases include cloud integrated tiered storage, big data analytics infrastructures and data protection and replication.Solution Validation CentersEquinix Solution Validation Centers (SVCs) are facilities that allow customers to test their IT infrastructure, network, cloud and data center rollouts in a real-world environment before full build-out and deployment. Customers can measure how their applications perform when moved off legacy systems, spot and address technical barriers, and optimize various infrastructure components, network connections and applications. As of December 31, 2016, its SVCs operated in 18 markets globally.The Company competes with AT&T, COLT, NTT, CoreSite, Digital Realty Trust, Global Switch, Interxion, Telehouse, Digital Realty Trust, DuPont Fabros Technology, e-Shelter, Global Switch, CenturyLink, NaviSite, Rackspace, SunGard and Verizon Business.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

        Gartner Report - Colocation-Based Interconnection         Increasingly, enterprises are leveraging hybrid IT to manage their enterprise resources and assets in the cloud, alongside their on-premises and colocation infrastructures. And with the expansion of hybrid IT in digital business, companies’ reliance and expectations around interconnection are also expanding.   Highlights:  Deploy data center interconnection that is as flexible and agile as your dynamic digital assets. Leveraging a data center interconnect fabric model that interconnects digital business and elevates its value.   We propose that topology, technology and design all favor building a digital business solution using colocation-based, programmable networking, which we will call ‘data center interconnect fabric,’ allowing dynamic interconnection between enterprise						peers, cloud providers, communications providers and a growing marketplace of service providers.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

Equinix, Inc. is an American multinational company headquartered in Redwood City, California, that specializes in enabling global interconnection between organizations and their employees, customers, partners, data and clouds. The company is the leading global colocation data center provider by market share,[2] and it operates 175+ data centers in 44 major metropolitan areas in 22 countries on five continents.
Equinix was founded in 1998 to provide a neutral place where the networks forming the early internet could exchange data traffic. It expanded to Asia-Pacific in 2002[3] and Europe in 2007.[4] The company later began operating facilities in Latin America in 2011[5] and in the Middle East in 2012.[6] Its purchase of TelecityGroup in early 2016 established the company as the largest colocation provider in Europe.[7] In May 2017, Equinix completed the purchase of 29 Verizon data centers in a move to expand its presence across 15 markets in the U.S. and Latin America.[8]
The company offers colocation, interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,500+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers host more than 2,750 cloud and IT service providers. Equinix offers several interconnection services, including Equinix Cross Connects, Equinix Performance Hub and Equinix Data Hub. The company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange and an Internet Exchange. Its Professional Services group offers various consulting and technical support services.
Equinix says its broad geographic reach is a key differentiator that allows its customers to place equipment in proximity to their end users worldwide, which the company claims results in superior connectivity. Its global data center platform, which it calls Platform Equinix, is one of three components of a triple-ringed “moat”[9] the company says it must maintain to continue to outpace its competitors. It says the other two components are the interconnected industry ecosystems that populate its data center platform and its commitment to service excellence.[10]
The name Equinix combines words that describe what the company’s founders saw as its core attributes: Equality, neutrality and internet exchange. The name is pronounced with a soft “e” on the first syllable so that it mimics the pronunciation of “equity.”[11]
Equinix reports 6,200+ employees globally and is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbol EQIX.[12]
Equinix reported 2016 revenues of $3.61 billion.[13]

History[edit]
Equinix was founded in 1998 by Al Avery and Jay Adelson, two facilities managers at Digital Equipment Corporation. The founders believed that existing data centers would not be sufficient to support the rapid growth of the internet and saw the opportunity to deploy data centers on a much larger scale to support this growth. In an interview, Adelson recalled that the early internet was "run by cowboys. … It just wasn't hardened, it wasn't commercialized. And for those of us that cared, we knew that a company like Equinix would need to exist. Somebody would have to be the steward of all this infrastructure."[14]
Equinix promoted its data center platform as a neutral place where competing networks could connect and share data traffic.[15] This peering model extended each carrier’s individual reach, regionally and globally, and its wider adoption enabled the massive peering that led to the explosive growth of the internet, the “network of networks.”[16]
Equinix focused on expanding interconnection from its inception, as it aimed to capitalize on the so-called “network effect,” through which each new customer would broaden the appeal of its platform.[17] Each new carrier, for example, would expand network route options for content providers, who were then increasingly drawn to Equinix and, in turn, increased Equinix’s appeal to advertisers who wanted to do business with those content providers. In an early interview, an Equinix marketing executive said the company’s strategy was to find “people who bring people who have relationships with people.”[15] The company’s first data centers opened in New York City, Silicon Valley, and the Washington D.C. area.[11] Soon after, the company began a continuous and steady expansion that aligned with its internal philosophy to always attempt to increase interconnection opportunities ahead of market demand.[18]
Expansion[edit]
Equinix’s overseas expansion began in 2002 in Asia-Pacific, after it acquired data centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo in mergers with i-STT and Pihana Pacific.[3]
Steve Smith took over as CEO in 2007,[1] the same year Equinix announced a $2 billion international expansion plan and entered the European market by acquiring data center operator IXEurope and its facilities in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. That plan was completed with the 2010 opening of Equinix’s 50th global data center, in London,[19] but a more intense period of growth followed. Over the next seven years, the company nearly tripled its data center portfolio, growth the company attributes to increased demand for interconnection services caused by the emergence of cloud computing, along with the expansion of related trends such as the Internet of Things and big data.[20][21][22]
Equinix’s next major acquisition came in 2010, when the company purchased Switch and Data Facilities Company, Inc., a U.S. internet exchange and colocation services provider with locations in 23 North American markets. The transaction was valued at approximately $683.4 million.[23]
The company extended its operations to the Middle East and in Southeast Asia in 2012, announcing partnerships to enter the Dubai, UAE,[6] and Jakarta, Indonesia, markets.[24] Also in 2012, Equinix increased its commitment to Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, by completing a $230.5 million all-cash transaction for Hong Kong-based data center provider Asia-Tone. In the transaction, Equinix gained a total of six data centers and one disaster recovery center spread across the Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore markets. At the time of the deal, Smith said the acquisition put Equinix “in a strong position to establish market leadership in Asia-Pacific."[25]
In 2014, Equinix strengthened its Latin American presence when it paid $225 million to complete the acquisition of ALOG Datacenters of Brazil S.A., the country’s leading provider of carrier-neutral data centers. Equinix had acquired a 53% stake in ALOG in 2011.[5]
In 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend.[26] In addition, Equinix acquired the professional services company Nimbo as part of a broader effort to develop its professional services business to assist customers executing data center migrations or advancing their network and hybrid cloud strategies.[27]
The year 2015 was an intense period of acquisition activity and global growth for Equinix. Early in the year, Equinix opened five new data centers on four continents, increasing the company's data center footprint to more than 10 million square feet.[28]
The largest acquisition in company history was announced at the end of May 2015, when Equinix said it would purchase the British company TelecityGroup.[7] The offer was cleared by the European Commission in November, but only after Equinix agreed to sell eight of its data centers around Europe to Digital Realty Trust for $874 million.[29][30] In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the Telecity acquisition in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion.
The addition of TelecityGroup’s 34+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, making the company the region’s largest retail colocation provider. The deal also added network and cloud density to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle, and who were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation.[31]
The size of the deal raised questions about Equinix’s continued appetite for further expansion in the near term. Smith responded to the questions by noting Equinix ‘s strong balance sheet.
"This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities," he said.[7]
Four months after Smith’s comment, in September 2015, Equinix said it would buy Japanese provider Bit-Isle for $280 million. The deal, finalized in December 2015, doubled the number of Equinix data centers in Japan to 12 by adding five in Tokyo and one in Osaka. It also established Equinix as Japan’s fourth-largest data center provider.[32]
In 2016, Equinix opened new data centers in Dallas, Sydney and Tokyo[33] and announced a deal to acquire 29 data centers in 15 markets from Verizon for $3.6 billion. The purchase, which closed in May 2017, extended Equinix’s North American footprint into two new markets, Houston and Culpeper, Va., and expanded its Latin American presence by adding a facility in Sao Paulo and bringing the company into Bogota, Colombia, for the first time.[34] The company said all three new markets added an important element to its global platform, as Houston is an energy industry center, Culpeper is a highly secure hub for government business and Colombia has the highest number of subsea cable landings in Latin America. The deal also included more than 1,000 Verizon customers, more than 600 of whom were new to Equinix.[35] Many were from the enterprise market, which Equinix has aggressively targeted.[36]
In 2017, Equinix also opened a new data center in Sao Paulo.[37]
Smith frequently speaks of his goal to build Equinix into an “historically significant” company. He points to Equinix’s leading market position and commitment to continued expansion, saying it aligns with cloud-driven surges in global data traffic and the subsequent need for the colocation and interconnection services Equinix provides. “Equinix will be remembered in the history books for … how we interconnected the world,” he said.[38]
Data centers[edit]
Equinix has invested more than $17 billion since its founding to build its data center platform.[39]
Equinix calls its data centers International Business Exchanges (IBXs) to emphasize the collaboration and data exchange it says they enable. Chairman Peter Van Camp has compared them to "international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations."[40] Smith said the interconnection available within his company's broad data center footprint allows organizations to distribute IT closer to employees, customers and markets without having to build and manage the needed connectivity themselves. "We spend a lot of capital to build these facilities and companies take advantage of it."[41] Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges route internet traffic between more than 1,400 telecommunications networks worldwide.
The company cites its global average uptime record to demonstrate the reliability of its facilities and services. Equinix received positive press coverage in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 after its customers in the Northeast U.S. experienced relatively limited outages, compared to widespread problems at other vendors.[42]
Equinix has received various International Standards Compliance (ISO) certifications related to physical and data security at its data centers. They include ISO / IEC 27001:2005 and 27001:2013 Information Security Management System Standard, related to information and physical security and business continuity, and the PCI-DSS Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, related to physical security access to customer equipment.[43]
Cloud[edit]
Equinix says the cloud computing space is a primary focus. In a 2010 interview, Smith said the company’s top priority was to be “the home to as much cloud infrastructure as we possibly can.”[44] The Equinix Cloud Exchange is the focal point of company efforts to draw a heavy concentration of cloud providers inside its IBX data centers. It believes these providers can act as magnets to the businesses and other entities seeking services in the burgeoning cloud computing market.[45] As of the end of 2016, Equinix hosted more than 500 cloud providers.[46]
Some analysts have warned that long-term consolidation in the telecommunications industry caused by cloud will decrease demand for data center space and hurt the growth prospects of companies such as Equinix.[47] Equinix argues that accelerated cloud proliferation and adoption, along with the emergence of cloud-dependent trends and technologies such as big data, mobile and the Internet of Things, dramatically increase the value of its core interconnection offering.[20][21][22]
Equinix was described by an industry analyst as a “crucial middle man,” connecting companies that build private clouds on the Equinix platform to the underlying networks and public cloud providers they depend on.[9]
Enterprise[edit]
Equinix has emphasized expanding its enterprise business as more companies move aggressively to compete as digital businesses. In a 2016 conference, Smith announced a company goal to exponentially increase its enterprise customer base in the next decade. Smith estimated the total addressable enterprise market at 350,000 globally and projected Equinix could land as many as 60,000 enterprise customers by 2026.[48] Equinix’s total customer base at the end of 2016 was about 8,500, including about 2,250 enterprise customers.[49]
Industry observers said a challenge for Equinix would be appealing to customers who didn’t know they needed what Equinix offers: “Courting enterprises … is more difficult than serving Equinix’s traditional customer base, consisting of financial, network, media, and cloud companies. These customers basically knew what they wanted from Equinix, and all Equinix had to do was deliver.”[50]
Equinix says its appeal to the enterprise market is based on its network density, cloud expertise and what it says is a growing enterprise need to obtain services from multiple cloud providers just to execute routine business. It argues the only way the enterprise can meet customer expectations is with what it called an “interconnection first” mindset[48] that prioritizes moving closer to end users and enabling faster data processing and analysis at the “edge of the network.” The company has devised what it calls an “edge strategy” for the enterprise, named the Interconnection Oriented Architecture. This strategy is designed to allow the enterprise to move closer to end users by capitalizing on Equinix’s global footprint and the access it provides to multiple networks and cloud providers.[51]
Equinix also said its interest in cultivating enterprise growth was to ward off the threat presented by the largest public cloud providers, all of whom it hosts in its data centers.[52]
Some analysts have argued that the continued growth of the public cloud giants – such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure – would eventually lead them to abandon third-party colocation providers like Equinix to build their own data centers and take advantage of economies of scale.[53]
In response, Equinix has positioned its facilities as meeting places where enterprises could directly access as many public cloud services as possible and build customized and business-critical applications. The company believes that attracting more enterprises as they begin relying on multi-cloud strategies will further establish Equinix as an essential interconnection point between the enterprise and the public cloud, including its largest providers.[51]
Ecosystems[edit]
Equinix has cultivated several digital ecosystems on its data center platform, and says they are an important differentiator because business models in the digital age depend on collaboration across industries and regions to innovate and speed up production cycles.[54]
Company managers said they began noticing in the early 2010s that customers in different ecosystems were collaborating inside their data centers. Equinix today positions itself in the broader market as a place to find and interconnect with partners, citing the number of mature ecosystems it hosts on its global data center platform. It has also pushed its channel partners to sell based on access to a variety of ecosystems on the Equinix platform.[55]
The ecosystems inside Equinix include:[54]

Cloud
Network
Financial Services
Content and Media
Online Advertising

Sustainability[edit]
Equinix has implemented various renewable energy technologies and sustainability practices on its data center platform. In 2015, the company made a long-term pledge to power its entire data center platform with clean and renewable energy.[56]
The pledge followed criticism in 2014 from the environmental group Greenpeace, which said in an annual report on the environmental practices of Internet companies that Equinix had an insufficient commitment to renewable energy and carbon emissions mitigation.[57]
The following year, Equinix pledged to use 100% clean and renewable energy globally and signed deals with wind farms in Texas and Oklahoma to buy enough renewable energy to offset the energy consumption of its entire North American data center portfolio.[58]
Equinix said that, as a leader in an energy-intensive industry, it recognized that “delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms.”[56]
In a 2015 update to its 2014 report, Greenpeace said Equinix had made a “significant shift” in its renewable energy policies and that its 100% renewable power pledge “sets an important new bar that other colocation providers will need to meet.”[59]
Also in 2015, Equinix was also among the signatories of the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge.[60] As part of the pledge, signed in the run-up to the 2016 Paris Agreement on slowing climate change, dozens of U.S. corporations made commitments to a range of clean energy goals.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
