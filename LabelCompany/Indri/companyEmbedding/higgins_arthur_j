            Arthur Higgins Joins Blackstone’s Healthcare Team
        


New York, June 15, 2010 – The Blackstone Group (NYSE: BX) today announced that Arthur J. Higgins, former Chairman of the Board of Management of Bayer HealthCare AG, has joined the firm’s dedicated healthcare group, Blackstone Healthcare Partners.

At Blackstone, Mr. Higgins will join health care veterans Lodewijk de Vink and Doug Rogers in providing industry knowledge and expertise to private equity transactions. Blackstone Healthcare Partners is an integral part of the firm’s global effort in sourcing, analyzing and overseeing investments in pharmaceuticals and medical products. Blackstone Healthcare Group’s investments include Nycomed, Gerresheimer, Stiefel Laboratories, and Catalent.
Tony James, President and COO of Blackstone, said “With the addition of Arthur Higgins we have further strengthened Blackstone Healthcare Partners. They offer a unique value to companies wishing to access focused industry expertise of this group of leading healthcare stars along with capital to fund growth.”
Mr. Higgins had been Chairman of the Bayer HealthCare Executive Committee since July 1, 2004, and Chairman of the Board of Management of Bayer HealthCare AG since January 1, 2006. During his tenure at Bayer, Mr. Higgins led the restructuring and strengthening of Bayer HealthCare including the acquisition and integration of Schering AG and the over-the-counter medicines business of Roche.
Mr. Higgins started his career in 1978 in Britain with Bristol-Myers. He subsequently worked for Sandoz (1979 to 1984) and Fisons (1984 to 1987) before moving to Abbott Laboratories in the USA (1987 to 2001), where he held positions of increasing responsibility in the international and domestic divisions, including a two-year posting in Germany. He was appointed President of the Pharmaceutical Products Division in Chicago in 1998. In this position, he was in charge of Abbott’s pharmaceuticals business in the U.S. with responsibility for global pharmaceutical research and development.
In 2001, Mr. Higgins was appointed Chairman and CEO of Enzon Pharmaceuticals headquartered in Bridgewater, N.J. In this function, he also served as Chairman of the Biotech Council of New Jersey and on the board of the U.S. National Pharmaceutical Council.
Mr. Higgins has been a member of the Executive Committee of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a member of the Executive Council of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), and President of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Association (EFPIA).  He is a member of the Board of Directors of Zimmer Inc, Eco Labs and Resverlogix Corp.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
