 Despite a slowdown in economic growth and uncertainty about US policy, the outlook for Chinese businesses remains positive, according to Kate Richdale, co-head of the Asia Ex-Japan Investment Banking Division at Goldman Sachs. Richdale explains that Chinese corporations are strategically navigating China’s economic headwinds to stay strong, in part by raising debt offshore and deploying cross-border M&A strategies.

Chinese corporations remain extremely strong. Operationally their businesses are going well…. For our clients, they see this as very much related to what they’re doing from an M&A perspective. A lot of them have business rationale for going overseas, acquiring entities overseas, and the ability to raise debt offshore is very, very important.
 - Kate Richdale

 As China shifts to a consumption-led economy, the government has signaled a long-term commitment to environmental reform, both through its leading role at the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris and by making clean energy financing a key part of the agenda at the 2016 G20 Summit. Mark Schwartz, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia Pacific, discusses how China’s green initiatives align with its broader economic transition.

 Our Thinking 
 Macroeconomic Insights 
 China in Transition 








 The Rise of China's new consumer class 
Across Asia, rising incomes are creating an enormous new class of consumers. Much of that growth is coming from China, whose working population is larger than those of the US and Europe combined. As more Chinese consumers gain purchasing power, their needs and preferences will have a powerful effect on the global economy.

+ more







Who are they?
中国主流消费者
Today’s China consumer market is dominated by a relatively narrow middle class. Less than 2% of workers earn enough even to pay income tax. So what the world has seen so far is only a preview of the opportunities to come.

Four Tiers of Consumers 
 The “average Chinese consumer” does not exist. China’s consumers can be divided into four tiers. Future growth will come from two key groups—the white-collar “Urban Middle”, and the blue-collar “Urban Mass”. 
Next

 



Movers & Shakers
 China’s wealthiest citizens already make up a large part of global demand for high-end goods. Their spending patterns will continue to influence trends as the country grows. 


Population
1.4 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $500,000



 



Urban Middle
 This is China’s narrow middle class. Nearly half of them are on the public payroll, so policies to increase income will have a strong effect here. 


Population
146 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $11,733



 



Urban Mass
 This group—blue-collar workers and migrant workers who have moved to cities to find better-paying jobs—is expected to see the biggest rise in income. This will allow them to broaden their spending beyond consumer staples. 


Population
236 Million


Annual Income per Capita
US $5,858



 



Rural Workers
 Half of China’s workers still live in rural areas. With lower incomes and fewer available jobs, their spending is concentrated on essentials such as food and housing. 


Population

Annual Income per Capita
US $2000

what do they want?
他们的消费模式
Food and clothing account for nearly half of all personal spending in China. As disposable incomes rise, those consumption patterns are going to change. But affordability will still be an issue, especially for the Urban Mass.

Seven Consumer Desires
Chinese consumer spending can be broken down into seven categories.
The Seven Key Consumer Desires

衣Looking more beautiful
食Eating better
住Better home
行More mobility/connectivity
娱Having  more fun
康Well-being(health/education)
奢Luxury



A Look Ahead?
Comparing China’s consumption patterns with those of the US shows how as incomes rise, spending will shift from necessities to discretionary items.

“Fun” has the largest potential for growth.

What do they want?
Fun
娱乐
Spending on recreational activities—including travel, dining out, sports and gaming—is much lower in China than it is in other countries. That gap means that as incomes rise, this category could see the biggest growth.


% of Personal Spending on "Fun," 2013





 China 9.2% 




 United States 17.3% 

 Source: Euromonitor, CEIC, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 





Dining Out: Cost is Key
Most food spending is for meals eaten at home. For the young Urban Mass who eat out, affordability is a prime consideration according to a 2014 Peking University survey.

Travel: Already Growing
Although approximately only 3% of Chinese have passports, travel is booming. But affordability is still an issue: the Urban Middle takes more trips abroad, while the Urban Mass stays closer to home.

What do they want?
Technology & Media
科技与媒体
The perpetually falling costs of electronics, combined with the growth of “fun” activities such as movies and online gaming, are fueling significant growth opportunities in technology and media.

What do they want?
Well-Being
身心康健
As they move beyond the basics, China’s consumers will be looking to their futures: health and wellness and their families’ education. These concerns are especially important for a country with an aging population.

Healthcare: Controlling Costs 
The government has increased healthcare spending in the past decade, with subsidies to help contain the growth in out-of-pocket costs.

Focusing on the Children
China’s one-child policy means that most families have six adults saving for one child. That’s fueling growth in education, housing and other sectors.
Chinese parents and grandparents are saving for the next generation


2 Parents+4 Grandparents

 Going to School  (test prep + vocational training) 
 Getting Married  (gold jewelry + diamond) 
 Buying a Home  (down payment) 
 A New Baby Born  (diapers + infant formula) 










What do they want?
E-commerce
电子商务
Brick-and-mortar commerce in China is still relatively underdeveloped. And low car ownership limits shoppers’ mobility. But with widely available mobile internet, low shipping costs and a flood of cheap unbranded products sold online, conditions are right for e-commerce to take off.

The Growth Has Begun
China’s explosive growth in shipping is an indication that e-commerce is already expanding—and has potential to grow even further.
Shipping grew 10x from 2006 to 2014


 2006 1 billion packages delivered 

 2014 10 billion packages delivered

The Takeaway
总结
 The Chinese consumer market has seen enormous growth—and only 11% of the population has reached the middle class. As their ranks swell, so will their effect on the global economy. There will be huge opportunities for the entertainment, food service, technology and other industries. But to take advantage of them, businesses will need to understand China’s Urban Mass and Urban Middle, and align pricing, offerings and other practices to the groups’ specific needs.

Carbon Polymorph Group Minerals Market Projected to Witness Vigorous Expansion by 2021


Press Release   •  Jul 19, 2017&nbsp02:58&nbspEDT


















Carbon polymorph group minerals are elements which exist in more than one crystal forms. Various minerals such as graphite and diamond belong to the carbon polymorph group which are widely used in the in various industries such as agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and foods among others. Natural form of graphite is metallic mineral which consists entirely of crystallized elemental carbon. It is a good conductor of electricity and heat having the highest natural strength and stiffness of any material. These minerals are also some of the lightest of all reinforcing agents exhibiting high natural lubricity. As a result of the reduction of sedimentary carbon compounds during metamorphism, graphite occurs in metamorphic rocks while some graphite occurs in igneous rocks and can also be produced as a result of thermal metamorphism of coal.Graphite mineral are widely used in refractory for the construction magnesia-carbon bricks (25% graphite) for the purpose of lining steel-making furnaces. In addition, the mineral is also used in steelmaking for the purpose of carbon-raising in molten steel. Other applications of graphite include lithium-ion batteries, lubricants, and automotives, sports and marine as carbon fibered polymer composites.To access full report @ http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/carbon-polymorph-group-minerals-market.aspThe global market for carbon polymorph group minerals has been witnessing a significant increase on account of growing demand from its application industries. One of the major factors contributing towards the growth of this market has been rising consumption of these minerals in batteries. Minerals such as graphite have been witnessing a noticeable increase in production in its synthetic form. However, growing supply and demand gap of these minerals is expected to pose challenges to the growth of the market. Other polymorphed minerals of carbon such as diamond have contributed significantly towards the growth of the market. Industrial diamonds serve as one of the strongest minerals used certain industrial applications such as cutting tool. They possess several characteristics such as corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity, wear resistance and high strength and account for largest segment in the overall consumption of diamond on a global scale. These products are also employed in electronics, medical and abrasives applications. A sample of this report is available upon request @http://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4275Asia Pacific accounted as the largest consumer for carbon polymorph minerals such as diamond and graphite on account of growing automotive and industrial activities in the region, with china accounting for the largest producer of industrial diamond in the world. Moreover, rising industrial investments coupled with high GDP growth rate in emerging economies such as China and India are expected to drive the market as well. Growing demand for high strength abrasives for several applications such as polishing, grinding and cutting are expected to be one of the major factors driving demand for carbon polymorph minerals such as diamond. In addition, growing consumption of automobiles on account of rising disposable incomes and changing lifestyles of the individuals is anticipated to drive the demand for lithium-ion batteries in automobiles which in turn are expected to boost the demand for graphite over the forecast period. Focus on research and development activities to reduce production cost as well as increase the application scope of industrial diamonds is expected to offer significant growth opportunities for the growth of the market.Advanced Diamond Solutions, Inc., China Carbon Graphite Group Inc., MEGA Graphite Inc., National Graphite Corp., and Sumitomo Electric are some of the key manufacturers of carbon polymorph group minerals present in the market.

Product Overview
 

China Carbon’s main products include: three major series and more than 100 types of common, high-power and super- power graphite electrodes, high-purity graphite in various specifications, and fine-structure graphite products. With an annual production capacity of 30,000 tons, the Company is a large graphite and carbon production enterprise with the most comprehensive product categories in the Chinese carbon industry.
We believe that we are the largest producer of fine grain graphite products in China, with a production capacity of 15,000 tons, which we consider to be the largest in China. We also believe that we are the only Chinese producer capable of producing longer than 2.37 meters rectangle fine graphite products. Our graphite electrodes have the specifications from Φ100㎜—Φ1000㎜ with an annual production capacity of 120,000 tons. Our high-purity graphite products can include those as small as micro special-shape products to those as big as in Φ640㎜, with an annual production capacity of 15,000 tons. In addition, the Company also manufactures by-products such as graphite scraps, cokes, tar and silicon carbide. We can meet product specifications and categories depending on the customer.
Graphite is considered to be the purest form of carbon—we manufacture our graphite products by using a high temp-erature process whereby the heavy hydrocarbons are broken down into simpler molecules. The resulting product provides us with a pure grade of carbon, which we use to make our products. Graphite is valued for its good condu-ctivity of heat and electricity and high refractoriness. The utility of graphite is dependent largely upon its type.
We manufacture all of our products in China. Our products are generally used either as a component in other products, as an element of a facility or in the manufacturing process of other products. We sell our products to distributors who then sell to producers in both the domestic Chinese market and the international market. Our graphite electrodes are partially sold directly to the domestic end users.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
