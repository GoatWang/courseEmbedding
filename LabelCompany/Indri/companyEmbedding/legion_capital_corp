Legion Capital Corporation Launches High Yield Mortgage Fund
        																																												
              

          Fund fills void in real estate finance market, pays 8% fixed interest to investors

ORLANDO, Fla., Sept. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Legion Capital Corporation, a direct to market venture firm managed by noted venture capital executive Jim Byrd and President Brad Hilton of the famed Hilton Hotel family, announced that they have launched their newest venture fund, LEGION HIGH YIELD MORTGAGE FUND I, LLC, a $25 million real estate mortgage fund to finance property acquisition, renovation and rent.








"The U.S. Real Estate Market is experiencing a sustained recovery, with home equity nearly doubled since 2011. However, banks are still not lending money to builders and developers – creating a huge void in the market for real estate finance" stated Jim Byrd, Chairman and CEO of Legion Capital Corporation.  "This creates a great opportunity for investors looking for secured income in the current volatile market environment."
The Fund targets the growing demand for real estate finance in this expanding market. It will provide short term (6-24 month) loans, secured by mortgages on qualified real estate, to developers, builders and real estate entrepreneurs. Typical loan terms are 2% to 4% origination fee plus 14-16% annualized interest, as well as a 3-5% profit participation in the acquisition and ultimate resale or monetization of the financed property.
The fund pays an 8% fixed annual interest distribution to investors, payable quarterly, with the overall annual return expected to be in the 12% range. Initial demand has been strong, and management expects to sell the fund out quickly.
"This fund was formed as a response to tight bank lending practices during the recession. Those same conditions continue today, providing rewarding opportunities for investors," says Brad Hilton, President and Director (Grandson of iconic American Hotelier Conrad Hilton). "We believe the fund will appeal to investors looking to earn steady secured income with relatively low risk."
The fund will be managed by Byrd, Hilton and Legion Capital Co-Founder and renowned marketing expert Shane Hackett.

Private-equity firm Legion Capital Corp. said Wednesday it has filed for an initial public offering. The company is planning to offer 4 million shares at $1.25 a pop. The firm is led by J. Bradley Hilton, grandson of hotelier Conrad Hilton, who has worked in private equity and venture capital since leaving Hilton Hotels just before its sale to Blackstone 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    BX, +0.58%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         for just under $27 billion, the company said in a release. Hilton is joining venture capital executive and corporate attorney James Byrd and marketer Shane Hackett in Legion Capital, which uses crowdfunding and other new capital formation methods. Legion is planning to list its shares on the Nasdaq. It will use the proceeds of the IPO to grow its businesses and fund acquisitions.

iRobot raises forecast after boost from Amazon Prime Day, stock skyrockets to record levels
              
              iRobot Corp.  jumped as much as 30% in late trading Tuesday after announcing second-quarter earnings that were much better than expected and raising full-year guidance. The maker of Roomba robotic vacuums said it had profit of $7.9 million, or 27 cents a share, on sales of $183.1 million. Analysts on average expected iRobot to report a loss of 33 cents a share on sales of $176.2 million. iRobot also raised its full-year guidance, and noted a success on on Amazon.com Inc.'s  recent Prime Day, on July 11, not long after the end of the second quarter. "We sold more than twice the volume sold on Prime Day in 2016, which was twice what the volume sold in 2015," the company said in its announcement. iRobot now expects earnings per share of $1.80 to $2 on sales of $815 million to $825 million for the full year, after previously forecasting earnings of $1.45 to $1.70 a share on sales of $780 million to $790 million. iRobot--which also announced an agreement to acquire its largest European distributor, Robopolis, for $141 million--saw shares rise as high as $112.50 after the announcement, well higher than its record price of $104.61.

SEC concludes initial coin offerings are securities
              
              The Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investigative report on Tuesday concluding that tokens offered and sold by a "virtual" organization known as "The DAO" were securities and, therefore, subject to the federal securities laws. The regulator is cautioning investors that offers and sales of "initial coin offerings" or "token sales" by "virtual" organizations using distributed ledger or blockchain technology are subject to the requirements of the federal securities laws. Issuers of distributed ledger or blockchain technology-based securities must register offers and sales of such securities unless a valid exemption applies. Participating in unregistered offerings may subject participants to civil or criminal enforcement proceedings.  Securities exchanges trading in these securities must also register unless they are exempt.  "The DAO" has been described as a "crowdfunding contract" but it would not have met the requirements of the Regulation Crowdfunding exemption because, among other things, it was not a broker-dealer or a funding portal registered with the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. However, the SEC decided not to bring charges in this instance, or make findings of violations in the Report, but use the results of the investigation to caution the industry and market participants.

Polaris beats profit and sales expectation as ORV and snowmobile growth helps boost results
              
              Polaris Industries Inc.  reported Thursday a second-quarter net profit that fell to $62.0 million, or 97 cents a share, from $71.2 million, or $1.09 a share, in the same period a year ago. The off-road vehicle maker said adjusted earnings per share came to $1.16, above the FactSet consensus of $1.08. Revenue rose to $1.36 billion from $1.13 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $1.26 billion. Off-road and snowmobile sales rose to $845.5 million from $799.3 million, above the FactSet consensus of $761.7 million, while motorcycle sales fell 13% to $198 million but beat expectations of $192 million. The company raised its 2017 sales growth outlook to 12% to 14% from 10% to 13% and its adjusted EPS outlook to $4.35 to $4.50 from $4.25 to $4.50. "The powersports industry remained very competitive and headwinds persist, but we were encouraged by the return to growth in our Side-by-Side business and continued strength and aggressive share gains for Indian Motorcycles," said Chief Executive Scott Wine. On Wednesday, the company said it recalled 25,600 ATVs after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The stock, which wasn't active in premarket trade, has rallied 12.2% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Tesla stock initiated as neutral/high risk at Citi with price target 10% above current price
              
              Citigroup initiated coverage of electric car maker Tesla Inc.  Thursday, with a neutral/high risk rating and $357 stock price target. That's equal to about 10% upside from its current level. "We're positive on Tesla's position as a Car of the Future leader and view the upside case to still be significant, however, we prefer to wait for a better entry point either through: (a) A stronger balance sheet, which in our view would more favorably tilt the 12-month risk/reward equation, all-else-equal; or (b) convincing signs of a smooth Model 3 ramp with limited Model S cannibalization," analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a note. The analyst said he is "fundamentally bullish" on Tesla, but that both bull and bear cases for the stock have merit. On the bull side, the company has had initial product success, brand appeal, speed of innovation and tech/software leadership," he wrote. The next 12 months rely on Tesla achieving Model 3 conversions and meeting margin goals, while continuing to cement its leadership in self-driving. Tesla shares were slightly lower premarket, but have gained 52% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Polaris recalls tens of thousands of ATVs after reports of fire, fuel leaks
              
              Recreational vehicles company Polaris Industries Inc.  recalled about 25,600 all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) after reports of fuel leaks and fires. The recall involves 2014 Sportsman 570 model ATVs sold from April 2014 through May 2017 for $6,500 to $7,700 in several colors, which were made by Polaris in the U.S., according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall follows 30 reports of fuel leaks and four incidents involving a fire, although no injuries had been reported. "Consumers should immediately stop using the recalled ATVs and contact Polaris to schedule a free repair," the company said in a statement. "Polaris is contacting all known purchasers directly." The stock, which was up 1.2% in afternoon trade, has rallied 12.9% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 10.4%.
