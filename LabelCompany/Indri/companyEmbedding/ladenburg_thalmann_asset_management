History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Investacorp, Inc.[edit]
Investacorp, Inc., an independent broker-dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida, has been serving the independent registered representative community since 1978 and has approximately 440 independent financial advisors nationwide. The firm was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in October 2007.[10]
Triad Advisors, Inc.[edit]
Triad Advisors, Inc., was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in August 2008.[11] The firm was founded in 1993, and is a independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor headquartered in Norcross, Georgia that offers a broad menu of products, services and total wealth management solutions through approximately 590 independent financial advisors nationwide.
Premier Trust, Inc.[edit]
Founded in 2001, Premier Trust, Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in September 2010.[12] It is a Nevada-chartered trust company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, with assets under management of approximately $530 million.
Securities America Inc.[edit]
Securities America Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann from Ameriprise Financial in November 2011 for $150 million in cash and potential future payments.[13] The firm was founded in 1993 and has headquarters in La Vista, Nebraska. The firm is a SEC-Registered investment advisory firm that offers investment management, financial advice and financial planning through a national network of independent financial advisors. It is the nation's seventh largest independent broker-dealer (as ranked by Financial Planning magazine, June 2011, based on 2010 total revenue). The firm received the inaugural Thought Leadership Award from the Retirement Income Industry Association in March 2011.

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Investacorp, Inc.[edit]
Investacorp, Inc., an independent broker-dealer headquartered in Miami, Florida, has been serving the independent registered representative community since 1978 and has approximately 440 independent financial advisors nationwide. The firm was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in October 2007.[10]
Triad Advisors, Inc.[edit]
Triad Advisors, Inc., was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in August 2008.[11] The firm was founded in 1993, and is a independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor headquartered in Norcross, Georgia that offers a broad menu of products, services and total wealth management solutions through approximately 590 independent financial advisors nationwide.
Premier Trust, Inc.[edit]
Founded in 2001, Premier Trust, Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann in September 2010.[12] It is a Nevada-chartered trust company headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, with assets under management of approximately $530 million.

Securities America Inc. was acquired by Ladenburg Thalmann from Ameriprise Financial in November 2011 for $150 million in cash and potential future payments.[13] The firm was founded in 1993 and has headquarters in La Vista, Nebraska. The firm is a SEC-Registered investment advisory firm that offers investment management, financial advice and financial planning through a national network of independent financial advisors. It is the nation's seventh largest independent broker-dealer (as ranked by Financial Planning magazine, June 2011, based on 2010 total revenue). The firm received the inaugural Thought Leadership Award from the Retirement Income Industry Association in March 2011.

Technology Ladenburg Thalmann Jumps Into Robo Advice Market With $ymbil
Ryan W. Neal | Mar 21, 2016


































As the industry waits for LPL and Commonwealth to reveal their strategy on automated digital financial advice, another broker/dealer’s robo is now ready for the market.
Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services launched $ymbil, a self-service investment platform that automatically matches clients up with a Ladenburg investment model based on their risk tolerance. $ymbil only requires a minimum investment of $500.
Philip Blancato, the chief executive officer of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management, which manages the five portfolio models $ymbil uses, said the product is direct-to-consumer and new clients can fund an account directly through the $ymbil website. But instead of competing with other retail robo services like Wealthfront, Betterment or Schwab Institutional Portfolios, Blancato sees most of $ymbil’s business coming from Ladenburg-affiliated advisors looking to use the service to connect with their current clients’ children and tech-savvy boomers.
“If [advisors] have a millennial client that would prefer to enroll in a digital advice platform, they now have that opportunity,” Blancato said. Though $ymbil doesn’t currently have a white-label offering for advisors, Blancato said the firm is open to providing one in the future if advisors demand it. But “we felt like the way we could build an effective digital advisor would be something that compliments what we already have.”
That “something” is Ladenburg’s 10-year history of working with advisors, making it a brand advisors know and trust more than a technology startup, as well as the company’s philosophy of active portfolio management, Blancato said. So although an algorithm will automatically allocate a client’s assets to a specific model portfolio, those models will be reviewed, and altered, by a team of human investment managers.
“We don’t believe in passive management,” Blancato said, adding that it plans to tweak the five allocation models its robo uses as many as eight times in a year. “We believe tactically adjusting a portfolio will drive higher returns and reduce volatility over the long term.”
In a statement, Blancato said the robo’s portfolios will be managed by a “seasoned investment team that employs strategic asset allocation and tactical decisions to capitalize on market conditions and unique investment opportunities.”
Like with a white-label offering, Ladenburg would consider offering more than five strategies in the future and adjusting how it approaches assigning them to clients. Blancato said this is very much a “version 1.0” of $ymbil and plans for the product to evolve based on advisor feedback.
Timothy Welsh, the president at Nexus Strategy, said it’s interesting that a robo is finally coming into the independent broker/dealer space, a sector Welsh said is slower to adopt technology for fear of cutting out their own reps.
“With the new DOL fiduciary standard, they will need to have a low-cost option for retirement accounts and this will position Ladenburg ahead of the pack when it comes time to comply,” Welsh said, referring to the Department of Labor’s seemingly imminent rule imposing a “best interest” standard on all advisors to retirement accounts, which some argue will drive up the cost of advice for clients with smaller accounts. “It also gives Ladenburg a scalable platform that they can use to drive efficiencies and better enable their reps to charge directly for financial planning advice.”
Joel Bruckenstein, the founder of the T3 conferences, doubted that $ymbil would fly under FINRA’s recent guidelines on digital advice. Bruckenstein said even when he gave conflicting answers on the risk tolerance questionnaire (indicating high risk, but only tolerating a loss of 5 percent), the robo still recommended a growth portfolio. 
He also raised doubts about $ymbil only offering Ladenburg funds and the high costs. 
“I did not see which class of shares users of this service are invested in, but assuming even people with the minimum investment get the lowest-cost shares, the expenses seem high to me,” Bruckenstein said.
According to Ladenburg, retail investors only pay for the underlying expenses of the fund, which are netted out of performance. The annual fee on operating expenses is 1.23 percent, including the 1 percent management fee and 0.23 percent in underlying ETF expenses. There is no cost for advisors offering $ymbil to clients. 
This number is nowhere to be found on $ymbil's website, instead directing customers to the prospectus, where a note on page 13 states that internal expenses to cover fixed costs of the funds are capped at 1 percent. 
“Seems like a lot for a little bit of asset allocation guidance. You can get essentially the same thing from a lot of other firms for a fraction of the cost,” Bruckenstein said, even if the fee was only 1.23 percent. 
Adam Malamed, chief operating officer at Ladenburg, emphasized that $ymbil is not intended to replace advisors but rather to be a tool to complement their traditional services. And though he thinks Ladenburg’s first-mover advantage in the robo market—at least among other b/ds—is proof of the firm’s ability to remain on the cutting edge of advisor technology, the company built $ymbil with a long-term game plan in mind.
“I hear a lot of industry buzzwords about our competitor firms that are trying to build out their own capabilities,” Malamed said. “Everybody in the industry sees a long-term opportunity. I use the words ‘long term’ understanding that we built this for advisors… not for the next six to 12 months. This is something we’re looking at for five to 10 years.”
Advisors affiliated with Ladenburg can access $ymbil though Ladenburg Wealth Management Advantage, the firm’s suite of advisor resources.

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.
Recent acquisitions[edit]
Investacorp, Inc.[edit]

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.

History[edit]
Ernst Thalmann, an American banker, and Adolph Ladenburg, the scion of a German banking family, founded Ladenburg Thalmann in 1876.[5] In 1879, Ernst Thalmann paid $13,550 (equivalent to $348,000 in 2016) for a seat on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ladenburg Thalmann quickly became one of the most influential private merchant banking firms, a major financial intermediary between America, Great Britain, and the European Continent. It played an important role in financing the growth of American industry—particularly America’s railroads, utilities, and emerging industries—through the early twentieth century and was among the few investment banks to prosper during the Great Depression.[6] It has financed the merger of Mexican Central National Railroad of Mexico, the eletrification of Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro in Brazil, led the syndicate for Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bonds and was the bank Albert Einstein chose to invest 75% of his Nobel Prize money.
In the early part of the 20th century, many notable businessmen joined Ladenburg Thalmann as partners, including Gerson von Bleichröder and Benjamin Seymour Guinness. During World War II, Ladenburg Thalmann bought Deutsche Marks on behalf of the British government.
Ladenburg Thalmann provided banking services for British Security Coordination (BSC) throughout the latter's existence.[7] SOE in London was tasked by HM Treasury in July 1942[8] as the lead British agency for the acquisition of foreign currency, required in small denominations by members of the plethora of British covert wartime agencies, as well as the escape packs of Allied aircrew. SOE turned to BSC for help with this task; the very close links between BSC and the OSS meant that there was continual collaboration between the two agencies in support of this task. Some of the currencies acquired were seized from ships being searched in the Contraband Control Bases, such as Bermuda, Gibraltar, and Aden, or legitimately bought from legitimate passengers on those ships. Another source were the black markets in Tangiers, Beirut, Istanbul, and elsewhere, by the sale of commodities such as gold, platinum, diamonds, precious stones and Swiss watches. Most of these items, in short supply because of the Allied blockade and restrictions on movement, could be acquired by British government supply departments from within the British Empire using sterling as the purchasing currency.
Virtually every European currency was acquired, as well as South American and Far Eastern currencies; a statement from mid-1944 prepared for Winston Churchill cited the cumulative acquisitions to that date as being 600m French francs, 20m Belgian francs, 8m Dutch guilders, 3.5m Norwegian kroner, 3.5m Danish kroner, 6m Reichsmarks, 8m Spanish pesetas, 16m U.S. dollars, and 0.5m Argentine pesos. Excluding the U.S. dollars and Argentine pesos, the balance had cost the British Treasury around £2m. A major problem that both SOE and BSC had to contend with was the sheer weight and volume of small denomination bank notes; a number of surviving signals in SOE files at National Archives in Kew mention "tons" of bank notes.
There is no doubt that contraband seizures by Allied blockade authorities were 'recycled' to support wartime covert activity. Musson's Smuggling Fleet,[9] which operated from Gibraltar carrying SOE and SIS agents to and from Spanish soil, covered its tracks with a smuggling operation based initially on selling tobacco seized from blockade-running merchant ships. Tobacco was deemed a more useful bribe to badly-paid Spanish border and customs officials, and hundreds of tons were shipped in from Latin America, and North Africa post-TORCH, blended and packaged in Gibraltar, and handed to Musson's operation to maintain the smuggling cover.
Recent acquisitions[edit]

It is the nation's seventh largest independent broker-dealer (as ranked by Financial Planning magazine, June 2011, based on 2010 total revenue). The firm received the inaugural Thought Leadership Award from the Retirement Income Industry Association in March 2011.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
