FOOD THAT ENRICHES EXPERIENCES






When great food turns a meal into a memory, we know we’ve done our job.







Food inspired by the people we serve.
A revitalizing lunch that powers a team through the workday. 
A warm meal that fuels students through finals. 
The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.
Whether it’s designing an innovative menu based on consumer insights, setting high service standards, or ensuring we have the right people with the right skills, we put those we serve at the core of what we do.
Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

We believe that excellent food can enhance experiences and empower people to be better. So we work to channel our passion for food into enriching and nourishing the lives we touch. And we do it with a singular goal: to enable great food experiences that go beyond what’s expected.








OUR PASSION FOR FOOD GOES INTO EVERY ITEM WE CRAFT.
See how we feed people’s desire for experiences that matter.













WE BRING FLAVOR TO MANY INDUSTRIES AND SETTINGS

                                    In a recent study, up to 60% of hospital staff uniforms were found to be contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria and drug-resistant organisms¹. Developing a better way to clean uniforms could lead to fewer hospital-associated infections.

This is just one of the ways we innovate the everyday.

The essential nutrients that help a patient recover.
A game-time snack that energizes the most devoted fan.
We create memorable food experiences wherever people work, learn, recover and play.

Our approach is simple:

Craft chef-inspired menus with high-quality ingredients 
Encourage healthier living with nutritious options
Offer convenience that fits different lifestyles
Enable personalized experiences through exceptional service

Research and Insights
Our research platforms enable you to better understand student habits, behaviors, tastes and trends.


READ MORE








College applicants are social, sophisticated and savvy. They’re not only looking at the academic prestige of an institution but also considering the campus environment when making their college decisions. Your dining venues and menu options could very well be the difference between yes and no.
As a result, we are constantly collecting research and data on evolving trends, tastes, habits and behaviors to find out what students want most out of their campus dining program.
One example is our proprietary master planning process, MarketMATCHTM. With this powerful tool, we gain insights from your entire community, and then our team of diverse and talented experts recommends unique dining options and solutions customized to your campus. 
Evaluation and Feedback
We can help you maintain a high level of satisfaction by continuously evaluating performance with our DiningStylesTM program, and with Your Voice Counts, we glean valuable real-time data to respond to student needs as soon as they arise. 
Whether it’s optimized meal plans, new venue concepts or healthy and sustainable menus, our innovative dining solutions help enhance your brand and create the campus of your students’ dreams.

Culinary Solutions
Creating healthy, fresh recipes that students love, our culinary team puts innovation first.


READ MORE









The foundation of our innovative campus dining services is our team of highly trained chefs. They, with the help of dietitians and other culinary experts, go above and beyond to deliver a wide range of recipes, sourcing options and experiences for your students, all the while taking into account the latest trends and technologies. 
Fresh Menus
Our chefs know that the best-tasting food begins with fresh, seasonal ingredients prepared simply and cooked to perfection. We were the first company to offer diverse ethnic, cooked-to-order residential dining food stations, as well as “fresh for you” exhibition-style cooking on campus.
Customizable Meals
Even more importantly, our team is armed with the knowledge of what solutions best fit your campus’ specific needs, and can deliver a unique experience tailored to your campus community. Those experiences could range from gluten- and allergen-free menu items, meals derived from sustainable and organic sources, kosher dining rooms or a host of other healthy and nutritionally balanced choices that fit your students’ varied lifestyles.
Combine menu planning, food presentation and a top-notch service philosophy with an innovative approach rooted in local ingredients and international cuisines, and you’ve got the recipe for an outstanding campus dining program.

Campus Transformation
Custom campus dining environments help increase student satisfaction, campus pride and retention.


READ MORE








As a single-source campus dining service provider, part of our role is to help transform your dining venues into bustling hubs of student interaction. Fortunately, we have years of expertise in the design build and operation of residential restaurants, national, regional and proprietary retail dining outlets, campus convenience stores and markets and catering programs. 
Through customized culinary design and operational improvements, we turn your campus dining locations into energetic and welcoming gathering spaces filled with product lines focused on healthy and fresh options.
Residential Dining
Our residential dining environments feature chef-created menu options that take advantage of fresh, sustainable, local, and organic foods. They serve a variety of regional and international cuisines in rotating exhibition stations, and feature meals that meet the needs of special dietary requirements. More than that, they connect your campus via social media and promote innovative technology through mobile ordering, nutrition apps and an engaging campus dining website.
Retail Brands
We bring established national brands, as well as emerging and regional franchise brands to all our campuses. Since we operate more franchise brands than any other food service provider, our brand development experts know how to deliver national brand experiences, flavors, pricing and value. When a more specialized solution is needed, we use our understanding of student trends, culinary expertise and operational excellence to create proprietary and customized brands to deliver a dynamic retail dining environment.



















Convenience
We recognize an important complement to any on-campus dining program is the availability of a convenience store. We have reinvented the convenience store concept by creating our award-winning Provisions on Demand® Market. P.O.D. changes the campus store experience by blending the features of “corner store” quick convenience with modern market style and service. There, we offer students a variety of fresh food and produce, deliciously prepared meals and everyday essentials.
Catering
No campus transformation would be complete without an innovative catering program. Our culinary experts work with your university to craft unique, great-tasting recipes, all while staying within budget. From a boxed-lunch gathering for students to fundraising events with VIPs, our unparalleled university catering services really deliver.


Design Build
Our Engineering Solutions team will facilitate your next dining transformation project so it is completed on time and on budget, whether it's new construction, environmentally sensitive or a time-challenged project. Our unique capabilities in planning, design, construction, equipment procurement, and installation and facilities operations ensure that your next campus dining space is one students will be talking about.

Student Engagement
We’ve identified what students want: healthier, sustainable menu options and high-tech solutions.


READ MORE








Today’s students are entering college with a different mind-set. They grew up in the heart of the information age with regular access to computers, smart phones and social media. More than ever, they are looking to stay current and connected, and are constantly sharing, collaborating and giving back. 
What’s more, they are looking to actively engage with their campus community. That’s why we use proprietary tools to gather insights and identify the trends that matter most to students. From venues to menus to suggestion implementation, our number-one priority as campus dining providers is student satisfaction.
Health and Wellness
So how do we keep them engaged? It all starts with our health and wellness programs. In a recent survey, 60% of students stated they would eat on campus more if healthier options were available1. That’s why we bring our health and wellness platform, Healthy For Life™, to all the campuses we work with.
Healthy For Life™ features healthy food, nutrition education, and wellness programs that positively impact the entire campus community. Our team of talented chefs and dietitians know that the best way to encourage students to make healthier choices is to make “good-for-you” food delicious and satisfying. Designed to accommodate a wide variety of nutritional needs and to fill the dining environment with an abundance of wholesome, fresh, nutritious foods—Healthy for Life™ helps power a culture of health and well-being for everyone on campus. 
















Sustainable Solutions
As a large provider of dining services, we have the resources and expertise needed to create more sustainable food service operations on campus. We leverage our existing environmental sustainability platform, Green ThreadTM, to proactively take on environmental issues that resonate with students and help your bottom line.
We develop sustainable dining programs that are unique to each campus we serve and enable better connection with students. We address issues like responsible purchasing, waste stream management, green building operations and transportation. 
Innovative Technology
Our cutting-edge, flexible and low-cost technology solutions are a fundamental part of our campus dining services. In an increasingly tech-savvy world, we stay at the forefront of innovation and connected directly with campus communities by offering:

Real-time feedback
Social media integration
Online, mobile and kiosk ordering options
Digital menu boards



One of the more customized solutions we bring to campuses is CampusDish, our e-commerce-enabled web portal, which:



Gives students access to daily menus
Provides nutritional information
Allows meal plan membership sign-up
Integrates social media and customer feedback

Additionally, our state-of-the-art implementation and customer care support center is here to help you experience a seamless transition and ensure future success with your Aramark campus dining program.

                                    Clemson University produces artisanal blue cheese and grows produce like peaches and almonds right on campus. In partnership with the university, Aramark chefs incorporate campus-grown and locally sourced foods into menus and develop recipes that celebrate the unique specialties of each community. We created a salad that includes campus-sourced cheese and peaches, along with locally sourced almonds and Bibb lettuce, for a menu item that is nutritious and socially and environmentally responsible.
                                

                                        We have come up with similar innovations at several of our other campuses, such as Portland State University, where we source from local Oregon communities whenever possible.

                                    We are always looking for opportunities to find vendors close to campuses, work with supplier networks and partner with colleges and universities to maximize resources. Through a focus on local sourcing, we’re able to support the local economy and ensure the freshest campus dining services for your students, whose satisfaction remains higher than ever. This is just one of the ways we innovate the everyday on campuses around the country.

Research and Insights
We gather data-driven trends and employee insights to deliver exceptional dining experiences.


READ MORE








We believe the best dining experience is one that energizes your workplace and employees, creating a culture of wellness that promotes engagement and attracts exceptional talent. That’s why we go above and beyond to develop a deeper understanding of employee dining habits and preferences.
Your Workplace, Our Insights
By analyzing a combination of generational insights, the latest workplace and consumer dining and design trends, as well as employee surveys, we create unique dining experiences that meet the needs of your talent, office culture and business goals. Our highly dedicated staff then takes these insights and uses them to design fresh, ethnic menus and exciting dining concepts that will engage your workforce and improve performance. The result is an experience that is meaningful, authentic, sustainable and completely tailored to your workplace.
As an example, many of our partners have employees who are looking for food and beverage options during nontraditional hours. Recognizing that insight, we created a mini-market with a self-checkout, open 24/7. At another company, we noticed that peak dining hours were becoming too crowded, so we added mobile ordering and a takeout window to ease the rush.
Employee Response
We’re able to continually collect data and connect with employees via several different feedback and measurement programs. Through our Voice of the Consumer feedback tool, we can accurately measure your employees’ satisfaction and respond to their needs in real time. Using that same data, our expert team looks for growing trends and proactively innovates new programs and practices to help make our business dining services even better.

We understand that a healthy workplace is a productive one. Whether you’re just starting a health and wellness program or already have one in place, we can work together to ensure your goals are met.
Healthy For Life™
Healthy For Life™, is our comprehensive, easy-to-understand health and wellness program that helps support healthy lifestyles on multiple levels. Working directly with your on-site facility, we provide employees with better food choices and readily accessible nutrition information to ensure they are maintaining healthier, stronger lifestyles at work and at home.
We enable a healthy culture by providing delicious food with fresh, local and seasonal ingredients. We then make this known to your employees through communication on-site, and through our web and mobile platforms.
Not only that, but we also promote a healthy culture with education. Our teams of chefs, dietitians and support staff are trained to know everything about our food. By purchasing top-quality ingredients, following healthy recipes, offering nutritional information, and even suggesting meals to our guests, we task ourselves to be perennial educators.
Recognizing that healthy lifestyles are best sustained in a supportive, social environment, we extend our advocacy through menu promotions, healthy home recipes, station-specific tips for healthy eating, and retail programs.
Cooking Light Partnership
Additionally, we help your employees cultivate a healthy culture through our partnership with Cooking Light, the long-established health, nutrition, and fitness experts. Together, we inspire employees to eat smart, be fit, and live well in every aspect of their lives.  
The healthy choices and programs we provide are not only nutritious and great-tasting, they energize your workforce and support retention by enabling, educating, encouraging, and engaging your employees.

Culinary Innovation
We deliver a culinary experience to your workplace that sets the standard for the industry.


READ MORE








Our commitment to inspire keeps your employees engaged and satisfied. Rooted in the approach that everyone eats differently and a one-size-fits-all cafe doesn’t apply, our tailored solutions are based specifically on your employees – from where they live to what gets them motivated. We work every day to deliver innovative dining experiences that incorporate dishes with fresh, local ingredients and delicious menus filled with authentic, ethnic recipes.
Quality Ingredients
Our philosophy is that the best meals start with the freshest ingredients. Our team goes above and beyond to purchase the highest-quality ingredients for each recipe we prepare.  We incorporate ingredients that are better for you into each dish. Using leaner proteins, fresh herbs to reduce sodium, and olive oils and purees that replace bad fats, we’re able to create meals that are both healthy and great-tasting.
We locally source seasonal fruits and vegetables whenever possible to ensure that these ingredients are at the peak of freshness when they go into our dishes.

ELEVATE STUDENT EXCITEMENT
An innovative approach to school dining that is both student-centric and fiscally responsible—discover how to increase student satisfaction and participation.
 Check out our Advice, Solutions and Success Stories














Research and Insights
We conduct extensive consumer research to ensure we deliver to you a student-focused program.


READ MORE








A Student–Focused Approach
Our in-depth, proprietary Student ViewPOINT™ survey system delivers critical feedback for continual innovation in our K-12 food and nutrition programs. With more than 50,000 responses gathered annually online and on-site from clients, students and parents, we stay in touch with student dining needs, attitudes and behaviors.
The results of these ViewPOINT™ surveys drive customized solutions that provide ongoing improvement and valuable impact for the districts we serve. The surveys help identify what items are popular, what students value and expect, and what changes are needed. From these insights we are able to create more than 250 new recipes every year.
By conducting surveys before we begin operations, and then again every 12 months, we can regularly refine and enhance your program to raise satisfaction. 
Getting to Know our Customers
Because we are committed to designing a school dining experience that not only meets nutritional requirements but also promotes satisfaction, we listen closely to you, your students and their parents.
By conducting surveys and hosting focus groups with principals, administration, faculty and students, we can better evaluate program performance, menu enhancements, nutritional concerns, promotions and location-specific needs.
Additionally, we lead nutrition and health advisory committees with students, parents, principals and administration members. These groups meet regularly with our food service director to discuss:

Program feedback on menu preferences, dining environments and wellness promotions
Nutritional concerns
New ideas and potential enhancements for current programs



Student Feedback
We know that valuable feedback and great ideas are obtained simply through interaction with your students on the serving line. The cafeteria manager and staff for each school engage with students on a daily basis to get input, respond to comments and follow up as needed. Our food service directors regularly visit school cafeterias and participate in classroom activities to discuss school meals and sound nutrition. Visits with principals are routinely scheduled to share valuable information and insights so that we can best adapt dining programs to each school’s specific needs.
To make sure our services meet your satisfaction we go straight to our customer—your students and district community.
Taste-Tested and Approved
We hold taste-testing and sampling events for students, faculty and parents to determine and introduce new menu items. This helps us understand what works best for your district, while providing a “first-hand experience” with your food service program to encourage parent and community support.

Locally sourced food
We create meals with local ingredients by cultivating partnerships with innovative companies.


READ MORE








We understand the centrality of food in our daily lives. We seek to foster new connections from farm to school to support menus that emphasize fresh and locally grown foods. Through these partnerships, we procure foods that are raised, grown and locally harvested in a sustainable manner whenever possible. We then prepare them in a way that respects and maintains quality, freshness and pureness.
Partnerships
Collaboration with industry-leading partners is one way we bring locally grown produce to district schools. For example, in certain districts we have a strong relationship with FarmLogix, winner of the 2013 Chicago Innovations Award, which uses its proprietary technology to connect local farms with schools, hotels, corporations and restaurants. The results are fresher, healthier foods for children and dining patrons, as well as increased economic potential for Midwest farmers.
Education and Outreach
Offering menus with locally grown food gives students an opportunity to appreciate the origin of the foods they eat and promotes a better understanding of the value of sound nutrition. Through our partnership with Farm Logix we share:

Farm profiles for each locally sourced product to increase student awareness
Access to local farm websites that feature information, photos, and video about available products
“Farmer In My Classroom” programs where local farmers talk to students about the importance of eating fresh fruits and vegetables

A variety of fruits and vegetables each day of the week
Increased entree choices, geared to student age level and district operational capabilities
Different menu options on each day of the monthly menu cycle, compared to the repetitive choices of many competitors' menus

Drawing on extensive culinary and nutrition expertise, district and student feedback, and the latest research and newest trends to establish a superior food and nutrition program
Focusing on consistent menu and product quality, and nutritional integrity, to create menus that can be customized for local needs

Creating recipes that focus on “right-size” portions and socially responsible food selections

Proactively reducing sodium levels by using only frozen or fresh vegetables, eliminating salt in recipes and relying on salt-free seasonings to naturally enhance flavor
Reducing or eliminating fats in recipes
Incorporating the USDA vegetable sub-groups and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables every day at breakfast and lunch

We want to ensure every student has the opportunity to enjoy a tasty and nutritious meal. We understand and accommodate the varying needs of your students by providing:

Gluten-free products and menus
Tree-nut and peanut-free products and menus that can be implemented in a single school, or district-wide
Pork-free products and menus available

Student Tools
Building healthy eating habits requires giving people the resources they need to succeed which is why we offer a number of learning tools for your district. Interactive opportunities to instill valuable lessons about good nutrition are available through:

Growing Up Healthy Educational Series, an elementary education program that complements teachers’ classroom curricula, encourages healthy habits and establishes a foundation of age-appropriate nutrition knowledge

Expertise in USDA regulations
We meet your district’s needs and school nutrition demands by staying ahead of regulatory changes.

School districts that participate in federally funded child nutrition programs must address multiple and often complex federal, state and local requirements. We bring your district unmatched resources and expertise to successfully navigate the complexities of this challenging environment.
Preparing for Regulatory Change
Because we work proactively to address nutrition-related regulatory changes, your district will always be well positioned to comply with current USDA requirements and future changes for the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs. Menus designed for your district will meet or exceed the requirements of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, as well as state and local regulations. We continuously provide our operation teams with communications and training to manage a USDA-compliant and successful food service program. 


The Right Nutrition Strategy
We use the science-based frameworks outlined in the Dietary Guidelines for America and MyPlate in the development of our menus and student nutrition programs. And we are ready to help your district achieve the criteria of the HealthierUS School Challenge criteria if desired.

Insight

                                    One of the challenges schools face in increasing free and reduced meal program participation is that many eligible parents often do not submit applications due to lack of awareness about the program, misunderstanding of eligibility qualifications, lack of time and the stigma associated with receiving free meals.

At our core, we’re a people-based business. We’re here to give your fans an unforgettable experience they can’t find anywhere else. That’s why we employ an insights and analytics team dedicated to finding out exactly what your fans want before turning those insights into exciting, memorable and great-tasting food and beverage environments.
Fans Want It, They Get It
From local restaurant concepts to mobile ordering to exclusive dining and catering concepts, we give guests what they want, when, where and how they want it. We start by using our insights and analytics tools to determine where we can best improve the fan experience. Our team rigorously analyzes patterns, sales statistics and fan feedback to identify and infuse the critical components of our in-depth research into our everyday operations. Not only that, we also use that knowledge to design customizable food and beverage programs and practices that cater directly to your fan base. 
Innovative Fan Experiences
Some of our experiences include:

Exclusive brand and chef partnerships
Local restaurant dining concepts
Unique spins on traditional stadium cuisine
Locally sourced dishes designed by award-winning chefs
Digital menu boards optimized to feature fan favorites
Mobile ordering
Special celebrity chef appearances

More importantly than that, we have the resources, experience and expertise on a national and local level to build great food and beverage experiences no matter what event you’re hosting. We employ the latest technology to increase speed and engagement and drive sales up every day of the year. 
By understanding your fans’ unique needs, we’re able to assess where your venue is today and create a vision for where we can take it into the future. Only then can we make the ultimate fan experience a reality.

Insights and Research
Our food and beverage team has the tools to give your fans what they want, when they want it.


READ MORE








Collecting Fan Insights
Our goal is to give your fans an experience they can’t find anywhere else. So every program, every practice and every innovation is grounded in insights gathered from our in-depth research on the fans themselves. 
Using methods like primary research studies and focus groups, among others, we rigorously analyze relevant data on evolving trends, tastes, habits and behaviors among your specific fan base. We then take those insights and transform them into programs and state-of-the art technologies that give your guests what they want. 
Whether it’s an easy mobile payment option or a venue-specific loyalty program, our extensive research makes for a better fan experience.


Real-Time Response
In order to create an unforgettable experience, it is our responsibility to be diligent in responding to fans’ needs as they arise. We have the tools and technology to monitor, measure, adjust and improve every detail of your fans’ experience in real-time.
We install management dashboards that provide our managers with a comprehensive, real-time look at daily operations. And with Your Voice Counts, our enterprise-wide consumer feedback tool, we’re able to collect data, gauge satisfaction and identify new ways to engage with and excite fans based on feedback directly from visitors themselves.

Premium Experiences
Our expertise extends beyond standard stadium experiences and into exclusive premium services.


READ MORE









At every venue we recognize the need for special event and premium services. Whether we’re serving a room of VIPs, a wedding or any of your luxury suites, we give your guests far more than what they expect. 
With our premium services, we focus on identifying opportunities to enhance the fan experience through areas such as service style, elaborate dining environments and of course, high-end culinary innovation. While your guests are there to see the event, they’ll want to stay for the VIP treatment they receive.
But our premium services are not limited to luxury suite catering. We also provide restaurant and café service at many venues and can host a wide range of game day and non-game day events such as weddings, parties and meetings. That way, we’re maximizing your venue 365 days out of the year.
We can provide several personal touches to enhance your venue’s premium experiences, including custom menu planning, ice carving, décor needs and valet services.

Insight

                                    As the global health food trend grew, fans at stadiums and arenas across the country were seeking fresher choices in addition to traditional stadium menu options. At Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, our client and team members had an idea—to bring healthier, locally grown options into the stadium while promoting sustainability. 
                                

See our innovation




Innovation

                                    Working hand-in-hand with agriculture and landscape students from Colorado State University and the Colorado Rockies, we planned, planted and cultivated a first-of-its-kind sustainable garden outside Gate A of the ballpark. We then took the freshly harvested herbs and vegetables and used them in recipes and salad stations at the ballpark’s restaurant. 
                                

See the impact of this innovation




Impact

                                    The garden was a hit. Our team at Coors Field was not only building a more sustainable community and future but also providing fans and guests fresher menu options than they would get at a typical stadium. Going forward, we’ll look to continually innovate and improve our food services at all the stadiums and arenas we serve.
