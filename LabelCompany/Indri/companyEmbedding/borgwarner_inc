Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is the most visible stock index in the United States, but that doesn’t make it the best. In fact, the industry standard for market watchers and institutional 
investors in gauging portfolio performance is the S&P 500.


The DJIA relies on just 30 stocks as a sample of large- and mega-cap firms, dwarfed by the 500 contained in the S&P 500, and it also weights its returns using an outdated and flawed price-weighting 
method. The S&P 500’s weighting is based on market cap, making it a much better representation of actual market performance for large- and mega-cap stocks.

DETROIT -- BorgWarner Inc. agreed to acquire Sevcon Inc. for an estimated $200 million in a deal that adds more electric vehicle technology to the supplier's vehicle-propulsion engineering and product portfolio.
The purchase gives BorgWarner, a major automotive powertrain supplier, notably transmissions and turbochargers, better access to electric propulsion markets in the U.S. and Europe, the company said Monday.
The deal also accelerates the company's "existing strategy to supply leading technology for all types of propulsion systems; combustion, hybrid and electric," BorgWarner CEO James Verrier said in a statement.
Sevcon, a U.K. manufacturer of controls and battery chargers for zero-emission hybrid and electric vehicles, said the purchase price was equal to $22 a share, or a 61 percent premium above the closing price of the company's shares on July 14.
BorgWarner will likely fund the transaction with existing cash.
"The proposed merger with BorgWarner provides substantial value to our stockholders and the chance for Sevcon to maximize previous growth investments and capitalize on greater opportunities as a part of a much larger organization with significant market presence," Sevcon CEO Matt Boyle said.
Sales at BorgWarner's engine business rose by 6.9 percent to nearly $1.5 billion in the first quarter. The company's drivetrain business is also growing, with first-quarter sales rising 5.2 percent to nearly $925 million.
The deal, pending shareholder and antitrust approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.
"BorgWarner should be able to expand Sevcon's technologies to new applications, geographies and volume programs in the long-term," Wells Fargo analyst Richard Kwas said in a note to investors, adding that BorgWarner is an existing customer of Sevcon.
The latest deal is expected to help BorgWarner navigate a landscape in which the auto industry is slowly migrating from the combustible engine to other forms of power -- notably electric and fuel cells.
In April, BorgWarner invested in Autotech Ventures, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm, which monitors and backs new automotive and technology startups. BorgWarner Chief Strategy Officer Brady Ericson said at the time that the $10 million investment would help the company adapt to shifts in propulsion technology and personal mobility.
"While trends from electrification and autonomy continue to evolve, BorgWarner's recent business moves are defining its position in the future automotive landscape," Ericson said in a statement in April about the Autotech investment.
BorgWarner, of Auburn Hills, Mich., ranks No. 28 on the Automotive News list of the top 100 global suppliers, with worldwide parts sales to automakers of $8.02 billion in 2015.

Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc.

Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc. Company History
Headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan, BorgWarner Inc. is a worldwide leader in the development and production of highly engineered engine and drivetrain components and systems for nearly every major automaker. BorgWarner’s technological advances in the automotive industry span over a century. Originating in 1880 as the Morse Equalizing Spring Company, Borg-Warner Corporation was later formed in 1928 by a collection of companies including Borg & Beck, Marvel-Schebler, Warner Gear, and Mechanics Universal Joint. A spin off from Borg-Warner Security Corporation, Borg-Warner Automotive Inc. became an independent company in 1993. Now known as BorgWarner Inc., the company currently employs 16,000 individuals at 60 locations in 18 countries and cited combined worldwide sales exceeding $4 billion in 2009. To date, BorgWarner has approximately 2,800 active patents and patent applications pending or under preparation.
Products Manufactured by Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc. that Contained Asbestos
Exposure to asbestos as a “causative factor” in the development of mesothelioma has been recognized by several organizations including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
A documented court case identified Borg-Warner disk brake pads to have contained chrysotile asbestos fibers, of which such fibers comprised seven to twenty-eight percent of the pad’s weight dependent upon the type of pad.
In another documented court case, Borg-Warner was identified as the manufacturer of automotive parts, including disc-type clutches, composed of chrysotile asbestos. Of note was that there were no warnings contained on the product itself or its packaging indicating the potential danger to an individual as a result of asbestos exposure.
A 1972 study conducted by Borg-Warner indicated that its clutch manufacturing operations produced levels of airborne asbestos fibers that were in excess of OSHA standards. From the early 1960's to the early 1980's, Borg-Warner supplied the aforementioned clutches to General Motors for installation on new vehicles until the company made the decision to dispose of its clutch operation.
Among the products produced by Borg-Warner Automotive, Inc. that may have contained parts with asbestos fibers are:

Borg-Warner disk brake pads
Borg-Warner disc-type clutches

Occupations at Risk for Asbestos Exposure
Brake mechanics, auto mechanics and any individuals exposed to an environment where brake repair and/or any work with asbestos-containing friction products, including clutches, occurred could be at risk for developing an asbestos-related illness. Often a mechanic’s job involved grinding the disk brake pads which in turn generated dust that would be inhaled within the confines of the workspace. As a result, it is alleged that exposure to this dust may result in a range of life threatening illnesses from asbestosis to mesothelioma. Since the fibers cannot be expelled once inhaled, there are no known cures for the resulting illness.
Family members of automotive workers exposed to asbestos may also be at risk of developing mesothelioma or other asbestos-related illness as a result of asbestos-contaminated garments entering the home environment and the asbestos fibers being released and inhaled.
Since there is an extended latency period with the development of mesothelioma cancer or other asbestos related illness, it can take decades (approximately 3) for an individual to show symptoms from the time of initial exposure. Learn more about whether you or someone you know may have encountered exposure to airborne asbestos in the workplace by visiting our asbestos exposure page.
Recent News
As of the year ending December 31, 2009, BorgWarner had been named as a defendant in 23,000 asbestos cases with estimated asbestos liabilities at $49.9 million. Plaintiffs in these cases maintain that the asbestos-containing components of Borg-Warner disk brake pads and Borg-Warner disc-type clutches exposed employees to dangerous levels of airborne asbestos fiber that resulted in illness and death. Borg-Warner Automotive Inc. remains in operation today as BorgWarner Inc. As a result of the demand for the company’s current environmentally friendly technologies aimed at improving fuel efficiency, air quality and vehicle performance, BorgWarner anticipates $2.3 billion of net new powertrain business for 2011-2013—a 28% increase over its previous three-year net new business.

Asbestos Exposure









Many American workers, across a variety of industries, were exposed to asbestos on the job. As a result, they are now at risk to develop mesothelioma.
In this section, learn about the history of asbestos use, about the products that contained asbestos and about the companies that manufactured them.  Find out which occupations and trades are at higher risk for asbestos exposure.  Learn which job sites across the United States were contaminated with asbestos containing materials and about the risks associated with handling asbestos.
What is Asbestos?

Long considered a miracle material, asbestos boasts excellent fire- and heat- resistant properties. This naturally-occurring mineral, now known to be a human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent), has a history that dates back to ancient Greece. Asbestos was used as a building material, even as far back as during the Roman Empire. Asbestos was a component of fabric that would be used in clothing and a variety of other textiles.
During the Industrial Revolution, asbestos use grew in factories and other heavy industries throughout the United States. Asbestos was used not only in factories, but also in oil refineries, chemical plants, on railroad cars, and in shipyards. Asbestos materials were used to insulate pipes and boilers in steam locomotives, to line tanks and ovens in refineries, and could be found literally everywhere aboard the nation’s ships, from engine rooms to galleys. As the twentieth century progressed, more uses for asbestos were found. It was used in the brakes and clutches of automobiles, insulated America’s new skyscrapers, and was used extensively in the construction industry, where it was used in asbestos products like joint compounds, cements, roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, siding, stucco, plaster, and much more. Those workers at risk included any that worked in an asbestos-heavy industry or frequently handled asbestos products.
By the middle of the twentieth century, it became apparent that asbestos was causing health problems. Asbestos exposure is now known to cause mesothelioma. This asbestos-related cancer can occur when asbestos is inhaled and the microscopic fibers become lodged within the outer lung tissue layer known as the mesothelium. This thin layer of cells protects and lubricates the chest cavity. Asbestos causes a sustained inflammation of these cells resulting in harmful scar tissue forming on the surface. This scar tissue lays the foundation for cancerous cells to develop.
Despite knowledge of the health risks posed by asbestos, historical records indicate that many companies who used asbestos in their facilities knew that the material was dangerous, yet continued to allow its use. Over time, as stories of sick employees became commonplace, the American government began to consider imposing laws about regulating the use of asbestos.

Asbestos Exposure in the United States

Exposure usually occurred at major construction jobsites, in shipyards, aboard navy vessels, and during construction or renovation of commercial buildings. People working in the vicinity of boilers and insulated piping often are at risk. In addition, teachers, students, and other staff members who work in older school buildings may be at risk of exposure to asbestos products, such as ceiling or floor tiles. Equally at risk are families of these workers, as asbestos often was carried home on clothing.

If you worked at a jobsite where asbestos or asbestos containing products were used, you may be at risk to develop mesothelioma.

Different Types of Asbestos Exposure

Military Exposure
Asbestos was used across all branches of the military for  many years. Navy veterans were exposed to high levels of asbestos while serving  on ships (aircraft  carriers, destroyers, submarines, battleships, warships,  etc.) in the naval fleet as well as in naval shipyards across the country. Army  veterans were exposed to asbestos in buildings on military installations and  while working on military vehicles. Air Force veterans were exposed while  working with military aircraft. Marine Corps veterans that spent time at sea  aboard Navy ships were exposed to asbestos. All veterans exposed to asbestos  have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial and Industrial Exposure
Many workers and maintenance contractors at industrial and  commercial job sites were subjected to dangerous levels of asbestos on the job.  Asbestos is a known carcinogen and the primary cause of mesothelioma cancer.  The types of jobsites where asbestos exposure occurred include oil refineries, power  plants, steel  mills and chemical plants to name a few. They all have “high heat”  environments where the use of fire and heat resistant materials was required,  be it in the construction of the plants or machinery or in the protective  clothing that workers were required to wear in designated areas (i.e.  fire-proof gloves and aprons). Today, even though the use of asbestos has been  banned in the United States, many existing industrial and commercial structures  may still contain a certain level of asbestos. It is important that appropriate  safety precautions be taken, where necessary, to prevent harmful exposure and  to mitigate the risk of developing mesothelioma.
Commercial Product Exposure
Do-it-yourself home renovation enthusiasts, as well as those  who worked in the construction trade, may have been exposed to asbestos while  working with popular building and construction products. Many of these products  were made with asbestos through the late 1970’s as the projects they were to be  used in required that they be heat and fire resistant. They included insulation,  roofing material, siding, joint  compound, ceiling tiles, flooring and more. Unfortunately when any of these  products were cut, sawed filed, or sanded, asbestos fibers were released into  the air. In the majority of cases, those working with the products did not use  appropriate safety precautions because asbestos companies withheld information  about the health hazards of asbestos for many years. Today, as a result,  construction workers and do-it-yourselfers are at risk for developing  mesothelioma or other asbestos-related  diseases.
Second Hand Exposure
Direct, on-the-job asbestos exposure did not affect American  workers alone. Their family members were also at risk of developing an  asbestos-related disease as a result of second  hand asbestos exposure. This type of exposure occurred when workers brought  asbestos fibers home on their hair, clothing or shoes at the end of the work  day. Those responsible for laundering their work clothes, day in and day out,  were most commonly affected, but even small children who spent time with their parent  before they had a chance to “clean up” from work were unknowingly placed at  risk of developing an asbestos-related illness.
Talc Exposure
Talc is a naturally occurring silicate mineral most commonly used in cosmetics and toiletries. Talc mineral on its own is believed to be safe, but talc deposits are often found near and among asbestos deposits. Due to this, some talc deposits are contaminated with asbestos fibers causing talc miners to be unknowingly exposed to asbestos. While talc miners are at the greatest risk of asbestos exposure, some consumer products, namely baby powder and, more recently, children’s art supplies, have been found to contain asbestos and cause regular users, mostly women, to be exposed to asbestos. Today, products using talc are tested for asbestos, but that was not always the case. Because mesothelioma has a long latency period, miners and consumers are being diagnosed with mesothelioma decades later from their job and use of the asbestos-containing talc products.

Unions Protect Workers from Asbestos Exposure

 Throughout the United States and across the world, hundreds of labor and trade unions are in place to protect individuals who work in myriad industries, from steel workers to plumbers, to electricians.  Unions have for a long time played a significant role in protecting workers right when it comes to asbestos exposure on the job. Unions have organized witnesses for court cases, have stepped forward to financially aid widows and children of those diagnosed with mesothelioma, and have fought against inadequate trust funds proposed by mega-companies to compensate asbestos victims.

Compensation for Workers Exposed to Asbestos

If you have developed health problems associated with asbestos exposure, you may be entitled to compensation.  Each state has its own deadlines, called statutes of limitations, which allow victims of asbestos exposure to file lawsuits.

When two close firing cylinders are exhausting on one cylinder bank, nothing is happening in the other bank, so connecting both pipes effectively enlarges the exhaust system, allowing these exhaust pulses to exit through both sides of the system. Exhaust flow is increased because both cylinder banks make use of both sides of the exhaust system, and increased exhaust flow equals more power.Show items:6090120Sort by:RecommendedPrice Low to HighPrice High to LowTop Rated ProductsMagnaFlow® Street Series Exhaust System(89 reviews)# sp598Street Series Exhaust System by MagnaFlow®.

While muffler designs may differ, all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent. Mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length. Tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends, which creates restriction.Sound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power. That’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note, so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel. Performance and sound are essential, but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last. All of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel, for long lasting durability. Each includes stylish exhaust tip(s), usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect, but if you prefer something different, check out our selection of exhaust tips.
Most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems, meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter. This means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check. However, if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter, we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions, but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter. These converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow, and smoother flowing inlet and outlet joints.If you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power, then consider installing headers. Headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds, which usually flow poorly. An exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port, allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head. All tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector. The tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends, which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flow.Featured VideosChip Foose's F10001Leah Pritchetts Challenger Hellcat02MagnaFlow at Monster Jam03The GRIDLIFE Experience 201704American Muscle05Borla & Ford F-150 Project06Ultimate Callout Challenge 201607Diesel Particulate Filter082016 Chevy Camaro Headers09Borla Cratemufflers Lead The Heard10Sema 2016 Recap Vibrant Performance11Camaro SS Varitune Axleback Exhaust122015 Max Performance Car Show132015-2017 Dodge Challenger14Flowmaster Racing Mufflers Silencers15Superbird Auto Club16Flowmasters 8 Hottest Mufflers17Supermaxx Headers Product Release18How Do You Want To Be Heard19Gibson Muffler20Flowmaster Muffler Silencers21Rattletrap Meets Winter22MagnaFlow Manufacturing23Borla Builds Excitement24MagnaFlow Production25Borla Exhaust Installation26MagnaFlow Evolution27Audi R8 V10 GT with Borla Exhaust28Flowmaster Charger Exhaust29Rock Hard Power30Marco Andretti Test Driving31Guides & Articles Performance Exhaust SystemsMay 17, 2016Here's A 'Tip': Exhaust Tips Are An Easy Way To...Performance exhaust systems give you improvements in power output, sound levels, and appearance, all in one package.

Some other sites had Gibson stainless steel exhaust systems, but when you did your research, the model number wasn't compatible. I checked the Gibson website to make sure that the product sold by CARiD was accurate.  It indeed was which was good. The price was the cheapest I could find on the web, plus it was shipped for free which was a bonus. Also Gibson had a rebate program special which was prominently advertised at the CARiD website which saved me another $25. All I can say that ordering from CARiD was effortless, quick, and well worth it. I think the product was shipped to me in less than 1 weeks time. That is pretty quick.EPosted by Erich (Tyler, TX) / June 27, 20172004 Toyota TacomaWas this review helpful for you?

Love the black and I threw the four inch tip on after and she purrs. But, found the hangers for the exhaust were dinky. The way it has no nipple on it is a joke. I had to drill holes in each hanger and put a cotter pin through it so it didn't fall off. Again. Hint at the new four inch tip that I order because the other one grinded down too nothing after dragging on the pavement. Not completely choked at the guys at CARiD. But MBRP needs to figure it out as well. CARiD has good service though you boys have made my truck look mint. Thanks.

And you get a deep, visceral feeling when you hear the exhaust note’s rumble that turns into a roar when you accelerate.Categories (10,751)Complete SystemsMagnaFlow, Gibson, Borla(7,687)HeadersFull-Length, Mid-Length & Shorty(5,944)Catalytic ConvertersCatalytic Converter Kits, Gaskets(3,441)MufflersMufflers, Resonators, Tail Pipes(497)Exhaust StacksStack Kits, Rain Caps, Stack Covers(3,473)Exhaust TipsChrome & Stainless Tips, Tail Pipes(5,808)Exhaust PipesHeader, Down & Crossover Pipes(7,698)Clamps, Hangers, GasketsGasket Sets, Flanges(39,917)Emission ControlOxygen Sensors, EGR Valves(5,236)Performance ChipsSuperchips, Bully Dog, EdgeFeatured BrandsBorlaMagnaFlowFlowmasterGibsonARK PerformanceCorsaMBRPInvidiaStainless WorksPaceSetterWalkerPypes Performance ExhaustHKSDynomaxSLPaFeAnsaBBKAPEXiGReddyDynatechHedman HeddersFlowtechSkunk2Perrin PerformanceVibrant PerformanceCherry BombWeapon-RAgency PowerInjenSome of the exhaust systems we have include an H-pipe or an X-pipe, because adding such a pipe to a dual exhaust system has been proven to unleash more horsepower. When two close firing cylinders are exhausting on one cylinder bank, nothing is happening in the other bank, so connecting both pipes effectively enlarges the exhaust system, allowing these exhaust pulses to exit through both sides of the system. Exhaust flow is increased because both cylinder banks make use of both sides of the exhaust system, and increased exhaust flow equals more power.Show items:6090120Sort by:RecommendedPrice Low to HighPrice High to LowTop Rated ProductsMagnaFlow® Street Series Exhaust System(89 reviews)# sp598Street Series Exhaust System by MagnaFlow®.

While muffler designs may differ, all of our exhaust pipes are mandrel bent. Mandrel bending ensures smooth bends and maintains tube size and shape throughout the entire length. Tubes that aren’t mandrel bent can lose a percentage of their diameter in sharp bends, which creates restriction.Sound is just as important factor in an exhaust system purchase as increased power. That’s why each of our systems has been tested to make sure you get just the right exhaust note, so you’ll enjoy getting behind the wheel. Performance and sound are essential, but an exhaust system also has to be made of quality materials so it will last. All of our systems come in stainless steel or aluminized steel, for long lasting durability. Each includes stylish exhaust tip(s), usually made from stainless steel and highly polished for visual effect, but if you prefer something different, check out our selection of exhaust tips.
Most of the exhaust systems we have are “cat back” systems, meaning they include everything to replace the exhaust system behind the catalytic converter. This means your emissions system will be unaffected and your vehicle will still pass a smog check. However, if you do ever need to replace your catalytic converter, we can offer you a performance option that will properly reduce emissions, but with increased exhaust flow compared to your original factory converter. These converters have a monolithic honeycomb catalyst designed for maximum flow, and smoother flowing inlet and outlet joints.If you want to go even further to reduce exhaust restriction and gain power, then consider installing headers. Headers replace the factory exhaust manifolds, which usually flow poorly. An exhaust header has individual tubes for each exhaust port, allowing each exhaust pulse to flow unobstructed from the cylinder head. All tubes meet in a larger tube called a collector. The tubes on headers are usually larger in diameter than the runners on an exhaust manifold and the tubes are mandrel bent for gradual radius bends, which reduces restriction and increases exhaust flow.Featured VideosChip Foose's F10001Leah Pritchetts Challenger Hellcat02MagnaFlow at Monster Jam03The GRIDLIFE Experience 201704American Muscle05Borla & Ford F-150 Project06Ultimate Callout Challenge 201607Diesel Particulate Filter082016 Chevy Camaro Headers09Borla Cratemufflers Lead The Heard10Sema 2016 Recap Vibrant Performance11Camaro SS Varitune Axleback Exhaust122015 Max Performance Car Show132015-2017 Dodge Challenger14Flowmaster Racing Mufflers Silencers15Superbird Auto Club16Flowmasters 8 Hottest Mufflers17Supermaxx Headers Product Release18How Do You Want To Be Heard19Gibson Muffler20Flowmaster Muffler Silencers21Rattletrap Meets Winter22MagnaFlow Manufacturing23Borla Builds Excitement24MagnaFlow Production25Borla Exhaust Installation26MagnaFlow Evolution27Audi R8 V10 GT with Borla Exhaust28Flowmaster Charger Exhaust29Rock Hard Power30Marco Andretti Test Driving31Guides & Articles Performance Exhaust SystemsMay 17, 2016Here's A 'Tip': Exhaust Tips Are An Easy Way To...Performance exhaust systems give you improvements in power output, sound levels, and appearance, all in one package.

Some other sites had Gibson stainless steel exhaust systems, but when you did your research, the model number wasn't compatible. I checked the Gibson website to make sure that the product sold by CARiD was accurate.  It indeed was which was good. The price was the cheapest I could find on the web, plus it was shipped for free which was a bonus. Also Gibson had a rebate program special which was prominently advertised at the CARiD website which saved me another $25. All I can say that ordering from CARiD was effortless, quick, and well worth it. I think the product was shipped to me in less than 1 weeks time. That is pretty quick.EPosted by Erich (Tyler, TX) / June 27, 20172004 Toyota TacomaWas this review helpful for you?

Love the black and I threw the four inch tip on after and she purrs. But, found the hangers for the exhaust were dinky. The way it has no nipple on it is a joke. I had to drill holes in each hanger and put a cotter pin through it so it didn't fall off. Again. Hint at the new four inch tip that I order because the other one grinded down too nothing after dragging on the pavement. Not completely choked at the guys at CARiD. But MBRP needs to figure it out as well. CARiD has good service though you boys have made my truck look mint. Thanks.

The only issue on the installation I had was the removal of the old pipe. It took me about 2 hours laying in the driveway start to finish! The exhaust system sounds super tuff when you're outside the truck and on the inside it's got great tone and in my opinion does give a horrible droning noise at any speed.

Good brakes are just as important as a powerful engine. Performance brakes provide shorter stopping distances, so the driver can spend more time on the gas for lower elapsed times, and performance brakes won’t fade, so the brakes work just as well at the end of the race as they did at the beginning.Categories (217,185)Brake KitsHigh Performance & Racing Kits(10,600)Brake PadsBrake Pads, Pad Sets, Pad Shims(55,227)Brake RotorsBrake Discs & Rotors, Rotor Shims(653)Brake CalipersDisc Brake Calipers & Repair Kits(186)Hand BrakesHand Brake Kits, Calipers(1,664)Disc Brake Conversion KitsDrum-to-Disc Brake Conversion Kits(3,035)Brake LinesLines & Hoses, Connecting Parts(276)Brake BoostersPower Boosters, Hydrovac Units(36)Line Lock & Roll ControlLaunch Control, Installation Kits(690)Master CylinderMaster Cylinder Caps & Kits(147)Brake Fluids & LubricantsSafe & Efficient Braking(8,535)Caliper CoversCustom Painted, Custom Logos(1,634)Wheel SpacersSpacers, Adapters & Kits(573)Brake PedalsBrake Pedals & Mechanisms(1,023)Brake ServiceCaliper Tools, Bleeders, HonesFeatured BrandsBremboEBC BrakesPowerStopStopTechWilwoodBaerHawkChrome BrakesDBAAkebonoProject MuKSportCentricRight Stuff DetailingARK PerformanceZimmermannSSBCATEMcGaughy'sBuddy ClubRaybestosACDelcoHelixMGPPro CompTeraFlexAlloy USAEarl's Performance PlumbingRubicon ExpressRock KrawlerWhether you’re building a race car or just want better braking performance on your street car, we have the brake kits and individual components you need.

Holes and slots also expel water, for optimal pad contact in the rain, and they vent gasses from the brake pads to reduce brake fade and increase pad life. We offer rotors in standard and larger than stock sizes in one-piece design and two-piece with lightweight aluminum center construction. Most have curved and directional internal vanes to maximize airflow for cooling. Our brake pads come in a myriad of organic, ceramic, and metallic compounds, so you can get the friction material that’s ideally suited to your needs.We offer both direct replacement calipers, and for the ultimate in performance, fixed calipers with multiple opposed pistons on each side of the brake disc. Both are made from lightweight aluminum. Fixed calipers transfer pressure to the brake pads more efficiently than the typical OE floating calipers, and multiple pistons apply more even pressure to the pads. Performance calipers often have larger pistons, which can provide more clamping pressure. Many calipers with 6 or more pistons have bore sizes that increase in size from front to rear, to keep the brake pad flat against the rotor and prevent pad taper.One of the easiest upgrades you can make to your brake system is replacing the stock rubber brake hoses with stainless steel. Stainless steel brake hoses have a Teflon inner hose with a braided stainless steel covering. This construction prevents expansion when the hose is pressurized, eliminating the mushy pedal feel that you can experience with ordinary rubber hoses, especially when the brake fluid temperature is elevated under performance driving conditions. The stainless steel also provides better protection against debris and abrasion, and provides a much better appearance as well. 
When building a race car and using calipers with different piston bores, the master cylinder bore diameter may also need to be changed to maintain proper pedal travel. Space is often at a premium on racing vehicles and the master cylinder may have to be smaller in size or mounted in a different location. We offer a large selection of master cylinders so you can get the one that’s best for your application, including tandem master cylinders, compact remote flange mount master cylinders, high volume master cylinders, and master cylinders designed for remote reservoirs.Disc brakes are the gold standard of braking, but if your vehicle is afflicted with drum brakes our drum-to-disc brake conversion kits are the performance remedy. Their ineffective drum brakes were the weakness of classic muscle cars, but with our conversion kits you can upgrade to disc brakes and enjoy stopping power that matches the go power. We offer everything from basic kits with front spindles, backing plates and caliper brackets that allow you to build your own system, to complete front and 4-wheel kits that include the above plus calipers, rotors, bearings, hoses, master cylinder and booster. We also have rear disc brake conversion kits to upgrade many late model pickups to 4-wheel disc brakes.
Brake fluid is one of the most important components of a high performance brake system. Ordinary DOT 3 fluid does not have a high enough boiling point for performance use and even lesser grades of DOT 4 fluid can be too hygroscopic and attract moisture, which lowers the boiling point. The high performance fluid we offer has been tested to 626°F, it has low moisture affinity, and resists aeration and compressibility to maintain firm pedal feel. We also offer DOT 5 silicone fluid for classic and show cars, which won’t harm paint if spilled. DOT 5 should not be used for racing.Featured VideosPower Stop Z26 Brake Kit01StopTech & Ford F-150 Project02Brembo Company03StopTech Factory Tour04DBA T3 Rotors05KSport Brakes06StopTech Sport Rotors07DBA Performance Pads08Power Stop Z23 Brake Kit09GT-S Brake Kit M4 & M8 Calipers10Rotors Manufacturing11Brembo at SEMA 201312Corvette Upgrade13Centric & StopTech Brake Pads14Power Stop Z36 Brake Kit15GT Brake Kit BM4 & BM8 Calipers16Baer at SEMA 201417Brake Pads Installation Tips18Bondurant Partnership19Z16 Brake Pads20Rotor Installation Tips21Caliper Covers22Guides & Articles Performance Brakes, Pads & RotorsMarch 03, 2017How To Select And Install Performance Brake RotorsPerformance braking is a topic that has widespread interest for our clients.

The tires would bounce in reaction to bumps, and tires that aren’t on the ground can’t direct, move or stop the vehicle. The suspension keeps the wheels in contact with the road surface for steering and traction, so power gets to the ground and you can remain in control. All suspensions have springs to absorb bumps and shock absorbers to control the action of the springs.Categories (24,539)Shocks & StrutsShock Absorbers, Strut Assemblies(6,489)Coil SpringsCoil Spring Sets, Coil Spring Seats(1,367)Leaf SpringsLeaf Spring Sets & Bushings(1,084)Air SuspensionAir Springs, Shocks, Air Lines(21,116)Control ArmsArm Assemblies, Strut Rods(12,621)Sway BarsSway Bar Bushings, End Links(4,672)Ball JointsUpper & Lower Ball Joints(95)Torsion BarsTorsion Bar Sets & Mounting Kits(323)Panhard BarsTrack Bars, Watts Links, Bushings(5,162)Shock & Strut HardwareUpper Strut Mounts, Shock Boots(372)Self-Leveling SensorsSelf Leveling Units & Relays(11,610)Suspension BushingsBushing Kits, Shaft Kits & Bumpers(1,056)Alignment KitsCamber Plates, Cam Bolts, Toe Kits(1,160)Suspension & Steering ToolsSpring Compressors, Axle Sockets(117)Suspension LubricantsGreasing Prevents WearFeatured BrandsMonroeArnottMOOGKYBDormanUnity AutomotiveMevotechFCSBilsteinGabrielACDelcoCentricSuncoreBeck ArnleyGenuineMiessler AutomotiveSachsSenSenFirst Equipment QualityURO PartsGSP North AmericaWestarOSC AutomotiveLemfoerderMotorcraftCardoneRight Stuff DetailingMoparOmix-AdaTRWThere are far too many suspension system designs for a detailed discussion here, but all can be divided into solid (beam) axle suspension and independent suspension. A solid axle is so called because the wheels on either side of the vehicle are linked by a rigid axle housing, and a bump in the road that affects one wheel will also disturb the wheel on the other side. Solid axles can be live axles that transmit power to the wheels or dead axles that do not. As the name implies, independent suspensions allow the wheels to move independently of each other, and the effect of a bump on the road encountered by one wheel will be isolated to that wheel and will not affect the wheel on the other side of the vehicle.Show items:6090120Sort by:RecommendedPrice Low to HighPrice High to LowTop Rated ProductsMonroe® Econo-Matic™ Complete Strut Assemblies(15 reviews)# sp4351Econo-Matic™ Complete Strut Assemblies by Monroe®.

A strut is a type of shock absorber that also serves as a supporting suspension member. There are modified struts where the springs are separate, but the most common type is the MacPherson strut, which incorporates a shock, spring and suspension member in one unit. When used at the front of the vehicle, the top of the strut is the upper steering pivot. Shock absorbers are used with control arm suspensions. Shocks and struts are the most commonly serviced suspension parts. Because they deteriorate gradually and degrade handling and ride quality, it is recommended that they be replaced after 50,000 miles.Leaf springs are the oldest type of springs and generally used to both suspend and locate live axles. They are the springs of choice for hauling because they can carry heavy loads and the capacity can be easily increased by adding leaves. Coil springs are the most common type of spring in use today. They are much easier to tune for specific ride and/or handling characteristics than leaf springs, making them ideal for performance vehicles. Torsion bars are lengths of spring steel that serve the same purpose as coil springs. The advantage of torsion bars is that they can be adjusted to correct vehicle ride height. Air suspension air springs use compressed air to provide a smooth ride and suspension leveling.The wheels, springs, and shocks or struts are attached to the vehicle with suspension members called control arms. Control arms can be called different names according to the suspension system and where they are located on the vehicle, including short and long arms, radius arms, and trailing arms. In general they are made of stamped steel or aluminum and articulate by means of bushings and ball joints. The control arms themselves are generally very durable and usually only replaced if bent, but the bushings and ball joints wear and require replacement to eliminate play that can affect handling and alignment. Sway bars are a type of torsion bar that connects the wheels on both sides of the vehicle to reduce body roll in turns.Featured VideosArnott Air Suspension Promo01Good vs Bad Shock02How to Choose the Right Shocks03Stopping Distance04Monroe Promo05Sachs Nivomat Shocks06Guides & Articles Performance Suspension PartsOctober 29, 2015Coilovers Are Pricey - Why Would I Spend My...When first glancing through the Performance Coilover Kits section of our website, you may be put off by some of the prices you see.

However, I ordered two shock struts at one time but got each shipped separately, meaning pay for shipping separate. Not  a wise-cost effective deal for customers. Both shocks came free of damage, seems to be in working order and at a reasonable price. Installation it's easy if you know how to do car repairs, not for everybody. So far they working good, and hopefully will last long. I always check CARiD.com for parts and prices. They need to work out a system to avoid charging double for shipping though.

Called the Caddy dealer, they told us that the new nuts were special order, and the size and description they gave didn't even come close to the nuts on the car. (Original nuts from the factory). Arnott should supply the nuts, as all replacement shocks come with new nuts and grommets. Will be calling Arnott to tell them that they make a good product, but like most companies now a days, if they can save a couple of cents, they will, at the consumer's expense.The nuts are not pictured in the photo's, so make sure you have new nuts if yours are rusted badly. Original shocks used allen to keep thee shaft from turning, Arnott uses Torx. CARiD delivered all they showed and promised. Fast delivery, and excellent service.MPosted by Michael (Yuma, AZ) / June 28, 20171996 Cadillac SevilleWas this review helpful for you?

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

44-09 4WD transfer case for Mercedes-Benz (1997)[1]


Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

BorgWarner Inc. is an American worldwide automotive industry components and parts supplier. It is primarily known for its powertrain products,[8] which include manual and automatic transmissions and transmission components, such as electro-hydraulic control components, transmission control units, friction materials, and one-way clutches, turbochargers, engine valve timing system components, along with four-wheel drive system components.[8]
The company has 60 manufacturing facilities across 18 countries,[8] including the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Asia. It provides drivetrain components to all three U.S. automakers,[8] as well as a variety of European[8] and Asian[8] original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. BorgWarner has diversified into several automotive-related markets (1999),[1] including ignition interlock technology (ACS Corporation est.1976) for preventing impaired operation of vehicles.[citation needed]
Historically, BorgWarner was also known for its ownership of the Norge appliance company (washers and dryers).[9][10]

Company history[edit]
The original Borg-Warner Corporation was formed in 1928[1] by the merger of Warner Gear,[1] which itself was founded by Thomas Warner in 1901,[1] and Borg & Beck[1] founded by Charles Borg and Marshall Beck in 1903,[1] Marvel Schelber Carburetor Co founded in 1905 by George Schebler and the Mechanics Universal Joint Co. The company was best known as the supplier of Warner Gear overdrive units for cars of the 1930s to the 1970s,[11] and as the developer of Studebaker's three-speed automatic transmission introduced in 1950,[1] along with 'Holley' brand Borg & Beck carburetors.[1] Ford took up development of the transmission in Studebaker's place in 1955. The early Ford automatics are derivatives of the Borg Warner.
In the 21st century, the company changed the styling of its name from Borg-Warner to BorgWarner.
The company is also notable for co-developing a variable-geometry turbocharger with Porsche, the Variable Turbine Geometry (VTG) system, used in the 2007 911 Turbo.[12] BorgWarner claims this technology will reach mainstream cars within 10 years.[12] From 2002, Peugeot, Ford and Renault became major customers for the company's turbochargers[1] with the Volkswagen Group on-board since 1999, choosing to exclusively use the BorgWarner K-Series turbochargers for their then-new 1.8T power plant.
BorgWarner supplies wet clutches and hydraulic modules for dual-clutch transmission systems. With their DualTronic[1] technology, BorgWarner has gained contracts with European automakers[1] that want to use dual clutch transmissions. The German automotive concern Volkswagen Group is BorgWarner's largest customer (by sales),[8] and Europe is their largest market.[8] Light vehicles (automobiles, car-derived vans, and light commercial vehicles) account for 72% of BorgWarner's total sales.[8]
The company's world headquarters is in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Robert S. Ingersoll formerly served as the company's CEO and Chairman. BorgWarner's Powertrain Technical Center (PTC) is also based in Auburn Hills.
The BorgWarner Indianapolis 500 Trophy is presented to the winner of the annual Indianapolis 500 auto racing event; this has been provided by the company since 1936,[13][14] as a legacy of Louie Schwitzer who won the first automobile racing event held at the facility, in 1909.[1] It was announced by the Izod Indycar Series that BorgWarner has been selected as the official supplier for the turbochargers to be used in the 2.2L turbocharged engine formula for the series which took effect in 2012[citation needed]. On October 2, 2006, BorgWarner announced the purchase of the European Transmission and Engine Controls product lines from Eaton Corporation.
Company structure[edit]
In 2002, BorgWarner Inc. was split into two key business divisions:[1]

BorgWarner Engine Group:[7] This is responsible for the research and development of the company's internal combustion engine-related components, along with operational efficiency, including fuel consumption, emissions and performance. Key products are turbochargers and other related engine operation components.[7]
BorgWarner Drivetrain Group:[7] The fundamental core of this division is its automotive transmission systems. These include manual transmissions, automatic transmissions, and the critically acclaimed DualTronic dual clutch transmission, which is more commonly known as Volkswagen Group's Direct-Shift Gearbox. Other responsibilities are its four-wheel drive systems and transmission electronic control units.[7]

44-09 4WD transfer case for Mercedes-Benz (1997)[1]


Pre-emptive torque management[18]

Multi-plate clutch coupling. The ITM 3e multi-plate clutch coupling is used in the Hyundai Santa Fe, Hyundai Tucson and Porsche 911. In normal conditions, it sends up to 95% of the torque to the front wheels. In the case of the Hyundais, the system can be locked in a 50:50 split so that you have a more dedicated off-road system. The system can be locked with the '4WD LOCK' button. The ITM 3e uses a multi-plate clutch coupling with magnetic activation


InterActive torque management[18]

Honda's Variable Torque Management-Four Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system was built in partnership with BorgWarner and provides a lightweight front-wheel drive system for dry-pavement cruising conditions that engages all-wheel drive (AWD) when needed to improve stability or maneuverability and can support medium duty off-road use via an electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential. VTM-4 was used on the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, and Honda Ridgeline.[19][20]
Honda's Super Handling-All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system was also built under the joint-venture of Honda and Borg-Warner for AWD systems. It acts like the ITM 3e coupling system, but also features a rear torque-vectoring axle

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
