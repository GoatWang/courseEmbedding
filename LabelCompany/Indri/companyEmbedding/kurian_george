How NetApp's CEO and his twin brother won the Valley after they switched jobs

NetApp CEO Geroge
  Kurian
NetApp




  The myth about identical twins is that they can simply switch
  places when they want to, so that being a twin is like having a
  best friend and a clone wrapped into one.


  For George Kurian, the CEO of NetApp and Thomas Kurian,
  Oracle's president of product development that myth is
  practically true.


They are literal doppelgangers who rose to the top
  with so much togetherness, at one point they literally got
  up and switched jobs, sending each of them on their current path
  to success.

George Kurian was appointed CEO of $5.5 billion
  storage company NetApp about a year ago after a fast, meteoric
  rise at the company. 


  Thomas Kurian has spent nearly 20 years at Oracle. He reports to
  Oracle's executive chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, and has even
  been rumored to be 
  in line to become CEO when Ellison fully
  retires. Sources close to Thomas tell us he
  has Ellison's ear because he's hardworking and smart and
  will challenge the geek-at-heart billionaire on
  technical product issues and tends to be right. Ellison
  loves a winner.


Business Insider recently met with George Kurian to talk
  about his career, his twin, and how he plans to
  revitalize NetApp, a $5.5 billion company with 11,000
  employees, at a time when the business is facing major
  challenges.

  George and twin brother Thomas are the youngest of four brothers.
  (George is technically older by a few seconds, he laughs.) 

The Kurians were born to a self-made business man in
  the scenic, laid-back beach and agricultural state of Kerala,
  India. Their dad was the son of a farmer who educated
  himself and became a successful in the manufacturing industry.
  His mom was born to Indian parents living in Sri Lanka. She
  immigrated to India to go to college which was "unheard of" for a
  woman in that day, George tells us.


  "We were all held in line by my mom. She was loving but tough. We
  were all raised with those Christian values and she did things
  very different than most Indian parents," he says.


  For instance, with all boys and no girls, she didn't follow the
  typical gender role stereotypes.


  "All the boys took turns in kitchen, did house chores, had to be
  responsible for clearing dinner, doing everything required in the
  house," he says.


  She was famously strict in the neighborhood. She would call the
  boys from their Cricket-in-the-street game at 6 p.m. and by
  6:01 they had to have their hands washed and be at the table or
  they wouldn't get dinner, he says.


  It worked. In addition to raising two multi-millionaire tech
  execs, her oldest son is a private equity investor in
  Bangalore and the second oldest is a pediatrician in the U.K.,
  George says. 


  Twin careers


  The twins moved to the US together to go to college at
  Princeton, earning scholarships to study engineering.

  Chef Day where an executive and a summer intern serve lunch to
  employees to raise money for the local food
  bank.

  "It was a good thing that we came together. It gave us a friend
  to navigate the big cultural transition between India and US," he
  says.


  While in college, George worked any odd job he could to
  raise spending money: "parking cars, working in the
  cafeteria, being a pizza chef, bartending, you name it," he
  says. "It taught me that it takes all kinds of people to make a
  business work."

George got a job at Oracle straight from
  college and Thomas landed as a consultant at McKenzie.


  A few years later, each of them wanted to try the other's
  job. So in 1996, they
  switched. George went to McKenzie and
  became a consultant and Thomas went to Oracle to be an engineer.


"It isn’t that we intended to that. It’s just that we both
  had good experiences and were interested in trying it out,"
  George explains matter-of-factly.


  "I worked at Oracle before he did, and introduced him. He's had a
  spectacular run there, going on 20 years," he notes.

George  moved to Boston to work for internet
  network company Akamai and met his wife. In typical style,
  Thomas married a woman from Boston, too.


  They even went to grad school, earning their MBAs at Stanford
  together. Now both brothers live in the Bay Area.

  But the twins don't share an extravagant lifestyle that most
  other multi-millionaire Valley execs do. No private plane for
  instance. 


  "If we got a private plane, our mom would smack us down," he
  laughs. "You cannot grow up in India without realizing that so
  many people have so much less than you have."


  One more thing his mother doesn't let him do? He can't act
  superior to his twin because he's a CEO.


  "When I told her that I was named the CEO, she said, 'Great, but
  we don’t carry business cards at home,'" he says, laughing at the
  story. "She constantly asks me if we’re being good husbands and
  fathers. That brings you down to earth."


  Fast rise at NetApp


  While Thomas climbed Oracle's
  ladder, George spent nine years at Cisco,
  NetApp's partner. That's how he got hired away to lead
  NetApp's flagship storage management product OnTap.


  NetApp was in a dire situation with OnTap. It had to be
  modernized into a "clustering" storage management product,
  something the company had been working on for years, not very
  successfully. In the meantime, competitors were eating its lunch,
  overall revenues were sinking. The company had more than
  one big layoff and morale was low.

George had no experience building storage
  products. His background was in networking and servers. And
  he took a lot of grief from his team for that.


  "I was reminded every day," he says.  


  He listened to everyone's ideas and he also challenged
  people. Some people didn't like it and left the
  company.


  He told the ones who stayed: 'We’ve got to make this successful
  otherwise the company ceases to be relevant in storage," and with
  the future of the company at stake, "everybody set aside their
  personal agenda and worked on it," he says.


  The product shipped and customers are buying it. Today it
  accounts for "80% of new shipments. It was essentially zero when
  I joined NetApp," George says.


  Some customers have become downright fan boys. The clustering
  technology means they don't have to schedule IT downtime on
  nights and weekends to do their work.


  Ordering more layoffs


  Now George Kurian needs to carry the success he brought
  to the OnTap group to the rest of the company. 


When NetApp's board asked 10-year CEO Tom
  Georgens to step down in June 2015, they
  made 
George 
interim CEO
  hiring him permanently a short time later.

George Kurian joined NetApp in 2011 and was CEO
  four years later. He had never been a CEO before.


  He knows he's got his work cut out for him. NetApp is still
  shrinking. At the start of this year, he announced another
  huge layoff, 12% of the company or 1,500 people. 


  He called it an "incredibly difficult decision" and says he wants
  to fix the company so he never has to do it again. 


  In December he bought Boulder, Colorado-based all-flash
  storage maker SolidFire for $870 million in cash.


  NetApp desperately needed to get into the all-flash storage
  market, the new direction for corporate storage. It's late to
  this area but George has a come-back for that criticism.


  "Being first to market is not necessarily the successful outcome.
  Violin and Fusion-io were first, look where they are," he tells
  us.


  Fusion-io hit a tailspin a few years ago and was bought by
  Sandisk in 2014. Violin Memory's stock is currently trading for
  less than $1.

  Still, NetApp isn't out of the woods. It reported
  a disappointing fourth quarter in May, with a miss on profit
  and revenue and dimmer-than-expected guidance. And there's
  endless speculation that its low stock price will make it an
  acquisition target. It's down about 21% from a year ago to
  about $26. (Likely buyer Cisco says it doesn't want it.).


  Kurian admits, "We've got a lot of work to do," but
  he says he's also made progress in his first year putting in
  new leadership, revamping business processes, updating the
  products and buying SolidFire.


  He says its his job now to "just execute."


  Thinking of his mother and brother, he also knows says he
  must "be humble about knowing you are not expert in all
  disciplines."

They are said to have been identical twins. Both grew up in Bengaluru, studied together at the St Joseph's Boys High School, and both got into IIT Madras.  Both left IIT within six months when they got admission into Princeton University. Singapore-based entrepreneur Varun Chandran, who has worked for NetApp and Oracle, writes in his blog: "Thomas graduated in BA electrical engineering with ''summa cum laude'' (highest distinction). In the second place was his twin brother George."  Both then had highly successful corporate careers. Now, George is CEO of NetApp, just six months after Thomas was appointed president of Oracle responsible for software development, making him then the single most senior executive in the company after co-CEOs Safra Catz and Mark Hurd.  The twins hail from a family in Pampady in Kottayam district in Kerala. Their father was the general manager of Graphite India in Bengaluru, news agency IANS had reported in January following Thomas' appointment as president in Oracle.  George joined NetApp in 2011. Prior to that he was VP and GM of the application networking and switching technology group at Cisco. Prior to Cisco, he was with Akamai Technologies, he was a management consultant with McKinsey and Co, and he led software engineering and product management teams at Oracle. George now replaces Tom Georgens as CEO; Georgens has been CEO since 2009.  On a visit to Bengaluru last year, where NetApp has 2,000 of its 12,500 employees, George spoke exclusively to TOI where he was "most excited by the people and the innovations that we bring to market being led out of India." He noted that two of the company's most important technologies - the storage efficiency technology portfolio and the multi-tenant capabilities offered to service providers - were both developed and led out of Bangalore. He said NetApp's India operations were the cornerstone of its APac business.  On George's appointment, NetApp said: "...we have the utmost confidence in George's ability to lead the company, given his deep knowledge of NetApp and support from a strong executive team. George has deep relationships with customers and partners globally and is committed to strengthening those relationships going forward."  When Thomas Kurian was appointed president at Oracle, chairman Larry Ellison wrote in an email to employees: "He (Thomas Kurian) has a long track record of developing suites of software products that go to achieve pre-eminent success in the marketplace."  It can't get more identical than this. RELATEDFrom around the webMore from The Times of IndiaRecommended By Colombia

How NetApp's CEO and his twin brother won the Valley after they switched jobs

NetApp CEO Geroge
  Kurian
NetApp




  The myth about identical twins is that they can simply switch
  places when they want to, so that being a twin is like having a
  best friend and a clone wrapped into one.


  For George Kurian, the CEO of NetApp and Thomas Kurian,
  Oracle's president of product development that myth is
  practically true.


They are literal doppelgangers who rose to the top
  with so much togetherness, at one point they literally got
  up and switched jobs, sending each of them on their current path
  to success.

George Kurian was appointed CEO of $5.5 billion
  storage company NetApp about a year ago after a fast, meteoric
  rise at the company. 


  Thomas Kurian has spent nearly 20 years at Oracle. He reports to
  Oracle's executive chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, and has even
  been rumored to be 
  in line to become CEO when Ellison fully
  retires. Sources close to Thomas tell us he
  has Ellison's ear because he's hardworking and smart and
  will challenge the geek-at-heart billionaire on
  technical product issues and tends to be right. Ellison
  loves a winner.


Business Insider recently met with George Kurian to talk
  about his career, his twin, and how he plans to
  revitalize NetApp, a $5.5 billion company with 11,000
  employees, at a time when the business is facing major
  challenges.

  George and twin brother Thomas are the youngest of four brothers.
  (George is technically older by a few seconds, he laughs.) 

The Kurians were born to a self-made business man in
  the scenic, laid-back beach and agricultural state of Kerala,
  India. Their dad was the son of a farmer who educated
  himself and became a successful in the manufacturing industry.
  His mom was born to Indian parents living in Sri Lanka. She
  immigrated to India to go to college which was "unheard of" for a
  woman in that day, George tells us.


  "We were all held in line by my mom. She was loving but tough. We
  were all raised with those Christian values and she did things
  very different than most Indian parents," he says.


  For instance, with all boys and no girls, she didn't follow the
  typical gender role stereotypes.


  "All the boys took turns in kitchen, did house chores, had to be
  responsible for clearing dinner, doing everything required in the
  house," he says.


  She was famously strict in the neighborhood. She would call the
  boys from their Cricket-in-the-street game at 6 p.m. and by
  6:01 they had to have their hands washed and be at the table or
  they wouldn't get dinner, he says.


  It worked. In addition to raising two multi-millionaire tech
  execs, her oldest son is a private equity investor in
  Bangalore and the second oldest is a pediatrician in the U.K.,
  George says. 


  Twin careers


  The twins moved to the US together to go to college at
  Princeton, earning scholarships to study engineering.





George Kurian prepares meals during NetApp’s Executive
  Chef Day where an executive and a summer intern serve lunch to
  employees to raise money for the local food
  bank.

  "It was a good thing that we came together. It gave us a friend
  to navigate the big cultural transition between India and US," he
  says.


  While in college, George worked any odd job he could to
  raise spending money: "parking cars, working in the
  cafeteria, being a pizza chef, bartending, you name it," he
  says. "It taught me that it takes all kinds of people to make a
  business work."

George got a job at Oracle straight from
  college and Thomas landed as a consultant at McKenzie.


  A few years later, each of them wanted to try the other's
  job. So in 1996, they
  switched. George went to McKenzie and
  became a consultant and Thomas went to Oracle to be an engineer.


"It isn’t that we intended to that. It’s just that we both
  had good experiences and were interested in trying it out,"
  George explains matter-of-factly.


  "I worked at Oracle before he did, and introduced him. He's had a
  spectacular run there, going on 20 years," he notes.

George  moved to Boston to work for internet
  network company Akamai and met his wife. In typical style,
  Thomas married a woman from Boston, too.


  They even went to grad school, earning their MBAs at Stanford
  together. Now both brothers live in the Bay Area.

  But the twins don't share an extravagant lifestyle that most
  other multi-millionaire Valley execs do. No private plane for
  instance. 


  "If we got a private plane, our mom would smack us down," he
  laughs. "You cannot grow up in India without realizing that so
  many people have so much less than you have."


  One more thing his mother doesn't let him do? He can't act
  superior to his twin because he's a CEO.


  "When I told her that I was named the CEO, she said, 'Great, but
  we don’t carry business cards at home,'" he says, laughing at the
  story. "She constantly asks me if we’re being good husbands and
  fathers. That brings you down to earth."


  Fast rise at NetApp


  While Thomas climbed Oracle's
  ladder, George spent nine years at Cisco,
  NetApp's partner. That's how he got hired away to lead
  NetApp's flagship storage management product OnTap.


  NetApp was in a dire situation with OnTap. It had to be
  modernized into a "clustering" storage management product,
  something the company had been working on for years, not very
  successfully. In the meantime, competitors were eating its lunch,
  overall revenues were sinking. The company had more than
  one big layoff and morale was low.

George had no experience building storage
  products. His background was in networking and servers. And
  he took a lot of grief from his team for that.


  "I was reminded every day," he says.  


  He listened to everyone's ideas and he also challenged
  people. Some people didn't like it and left the
  company.


  He told the ones who stayed: 'We’ve got to make this successful
  otherwise the company ceases to be relevant in storage," and with
  the future of the company at stake, "everybody set aside their
  personal agenda and worked on it," he says.


  The product shipped and customers are buying it. Today it
  accounts for "80% of new shipments. It was essentially zero when
  I joined NetApp," George says.


  Some customers have become downright fan boys. The clustering
  technology means they don't have to schedule IT downtime on
  nights and weekends to do their work.


  Ordering more layoffs


  Now George Kurian needs to carry the success he brought
  to the OnTap group to the rest of the company. 


When NetApp's board asked 10-year CEO Tom
  Georgens to step down in June 2015, they
  made 
George 
interim CEO
  hiring him permanently a short time later.

George Kurian joined NetApp in 2011 and was CEO
  four years later. He had never been a CEO before.


  He knows he's got his work cut out for him. NetApp is still
  shrinking. At the start of this year, he announced another
  huge layoff, 12% of the company or 1,500 people. 


  He called it an "incredibly difficult decision" and says he wants
  to fix the company so he never has to do it again. 


  In December he bought Boulder, Colorado-based all-flash
  storage maker SolidFire for $870 million in cash.


  NetApp desperately needed to get into the all-flash storage
  market, the new direction for corporate storage. It's late to
  this area but George has a come-back for that criticism.


  "Being first to market is not necessarily the successful outcome.
  Violin and Fusion-io were first, look where they are," he tells
  us.


  Fusion-io hit a tailspin a few years ago and was bought by
  Sandisk in 2014. Violin Memory's stock is currently trading for
  less than $1.

  Still, NetApp isn't out of the woods. It reported
  a disappointing fourth quarter in May, with a miss on profit
  and revenue and dimmer-than-expected guidance. And there's
  endless speculation that its low stock price will make it an
  acquisition target. It's down about 21% from a year ago to
  about $26. (Likely buyer Cisco says it doesn't want it.).


  Kurian admits, "We've got a lot of work to do," but
  he says he's also made progress in his first year putting in
  new leadership, revamping business processes, updating the
  products and buying SolidFire.


  He says its his job now to "just execute."


  Thinking of his mother and brother, he also knows says he
  must "be humble about knowing you are not expert in all
  disciplines."

NetApp Ousts Georgens, Names Kurian New CEO







byJoseph F. Kovar on June 1, 2015, 5:29 pm EDT


Printer-friendly version Email this CRN article









George Kurian



Storage vendor NetApp on Monday named a new CEO, disclosing that Tom Georgens, who has served for years as chairman and CEO, has left the company.
In his place, NetApp's board of directors has appointed George Kurian, executive vice president of product operations, as the company's new CEO. Lead independent director Mike Nevens is NetApp's new chairman.
No reason was given for the departure of the 10-year NetApp veteran who has served as CEO since August 2009. The company has been struggling of late, last month reporting a drop in revenue and income, a slowdown in its U.S. commercial business and a drop in sales through the channel for its fourth fiscal quarter, and said it plans to lay off about 500 employees over the rest of this year.
[Related: NetApp CEO Georgens Sees 'Re-Balancing' Ahead]
"It's no secret the brand is struggling, so it's not surprising. It's probably something that is overdue," said Stephen Monteros, vice president of business development and strategic initiatives at SIGMAnet, an Ontario, Calif.-based solution provider and Gold level NetApp partner. "On one end, you've got EMC, who is very aggressive and strong, and on the other side, you have innovative partners out there like Violin [Memory], so they have to do something. They aren't winning on either side against those two, and those two are on opposite ends. When things are not working out, and they haven't been for a little bit, you have to make a change. To make a lasting change, you generally have to start from the top, and it will filter down from there."
Monteros, whose company has been a NetApp partner for the past five years, says he's glad to see the move because he says it is better to do something than "to continue to watch the company deteriorate."
Kurian may not necessarily lead Sunnyvale, Calif.-based NetApp long-term, as the company plans to conduct a CEO search, Nevens said in a statement.
"While we intend to conduct a CEO search, we have the utmost confidence in George's ability to lead the company, given his deep knowledge of NetApp and support from a strong executive team. George has deep relationships with customers and partners globally and is committed to strengthening those relationships going forward. On behalf of the board and everyone at NetApp, I sincerely thank Tom for his many valuable contributions over the past 10 years," Nevens said in the statement.
John Woodall, vice president of engineering at Integrated Archive Systems (IAS), a Palo Alto, Calif.-based solution provider, said it was interesting that Georgens should be leaving NetApp the same day Cisco announced a number of top executives will leave that company.
"It's Bloody Monday in Silicon Valley," Woodall told CRN.
Kurian is an incredibly smart person, and has a very strong presence and charisma, Woodall said. "As head of operations, George has been more aggressive on timelines," he said. "Things coming from NetApp in the near future are coming from him and his teams."
While Georgens has done well at NetApp, it is no surprise that the vendor may be looking for a change in leadership, Woodall said. "As a company, it hasn't been growing its top-line revenue," he said. "You'd expect some changes. But, wow."
The move to oust Georgens is the second executive change for NetApp in less than a week. The company last Thursday grabbed former Brocade channel executive Bill Lipsin to head worldwide channel sales.

Dimensions: 9.5in. x 7.6in. x 0.9in.A ready-reference encyclopedia that includes short definitions and brief explanations of modern political terms that are used in countries throughout the world. The more than 2, 000 entries are concisely written and organized in an A-to-Z format allowing for quick search. This comprehensive reference has taken into account emerging nation-state identities, spreading democracy, instant communication and other forces that have created new relationships that require new definitions. Nearly every nation in the world is briefly described including important political events. The entries in the Dictionary of World Politics include familiar terminology such as McCarthyism or absentee ballot, but also dozens of less well-known terms that are associated with foreign events, countries for politics such as: cabal - in political terms, a group that conspires secretly to achieve some goal, such as the overthrow of a popular ruler; cadi - in Morocco and Algeria, official who heads local government in a rural commune; Islamic judge who presides over the religious court that uses the Quran as its law; and, dzong - in Bhutan, a monastic fortress that also serves as a center of local government. Dictionary of World Politics also contains an extensive bibliography. It is appropriate for academic and public libraries as well as high schools with Advanced Placement programs.
