South Dakota Sheep Field Day Proceedings and Research Reports, 1991
 



Title
Lamb Marketing - Today and Tomorrow



Authors
Jeff Held, South Dakota State University



Document Type
Report



Publication Date
1991



Summary
The major products from most commercial sheep flocks in the U.S. are lamb and wool. Basically, sheep operations can be classified into two categories, range and farm flocks. The range flocks are located in the semiarid regions of the country where feed resources are limited. Under this production system, producers emphasize traits which have the greatest economic advantage. Wool quality, lamb survivability and ewe adaptability are emphasized, with ewe prolificacy, seasonality and carcass merit having lower priority. In contrast, the farm flock operations are found in areas with unlimited feed resources. Compared to the range operation, the cost per animal unit in the farm flock is higher. Thus, emphasis is placed on traits which improve efficiency per animal unit, ewe prolificacy and lamb growth performance. Producers select breeds of sheep for their operations which excel in the traits which best match their management system and resources. Over a dozen different breeds of sheep are commonly selected for use in U.S. flocks. However, the result is tremendous variation in the growth potential, carcass traits and frame size of lambs. Lambs are fed to market weight in custom feedlots or by the producer and are usually marketed when they reach 100 to 130 pounds.

About Me In 1976, I bought a Guild D-40 from Herb David’s Guitar Studio in 
Ann Arbor, Michigan, threw it in the back of my old Buick, and moved to New York City. That guitar led me to a creative outlet, became a solace, my church, a road into the artist I didn’t know existed. I put every song I ever wrote into a big, black notebook. I will be dead in the ground before anyone sees or hears those attempts. And yet, like Lewis & Clark, I found my way to my version of the Pacific. Been on that beach ever since.

                Your Case Is Important. So Is Your Choice Of Attorney.
            
A successful personal injury suit can make a huge difference in your life whether the case is big or small. For some, it may mean the difference between having to file bankruptcy due to massive amounts of medical bills and having the resources you need to make a full recovery from your injury. You are powerless when it comes to preventing the negligence of others, but you do have the power to make an informed decision about the attorney you want pursuing your rights.







Why Am I The Right Choice For You?"You" is the key word. From the moment I speak with you in your initial consultation until the day your case is successfully resolved, my entire focus will be on you. Making sure you have answers to your questions, making sure you have the medical treatment you need, and making sure you are not injured a second time at the hands of the insurance companies.Over a decade ago I first began working in a plaintiffs personal injury firm as a file clerk. I have worked from the ground up litigating thousands of cases and understand what works and what you need. As an attorney for the last seven years I have built my practice on a foundation of personal contact. I will be the person on the other end of the line when you call, and I will be the lawyer handling your case. Every last dollar matters as you recover from your serious injury, whether a spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury. I will not be satisfied until I obtain the settlement or jury award you deserve to provide justice and fairness for your claim.











I have worked alone and with other attorneys to obtain financial compensation for the injured.
