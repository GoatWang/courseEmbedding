 HistoryArel Capital was founded in early 2013 by Richard Leibovitch and Gabriel Bousbib. Following successful nearly three decade careers in capital markets, asset management and hedge funds, Richard and Gabriel formed Arel Capital to manage their personal capital and the capital of a few former hedge fund partners. They decided to focus on US real-estate, with a particular emphasis on multi-family rental properties.  Parallel to his finance career, Richard had been successfully investing his personal capital in this type of properties.  In addition, Richard and Gabriel felt that due to the secular decline in interest rates, the urbanization of large metropolitan areas, and the growing demand by millennials for rental product, this asset class was likely to outperform, both on a relative and absolute basis.
Having known each other for nearly 20 years, and worked together for more than 10 years, Richard and Gabriel form a very strong team, with a very clear allocation of responsibilities.  Richard had overall responsibility for Arel Capital’s investment decisions, whilst Gabriel focuses on the firm’s operations and infrastructure.
During 2013 and 2014, a number of key individuals joined Arel Capital, further expanding the firm’s real-estate and finance expertise.  The firm counts today 15 full time staff and is headquartered in New York City.
The firm’s first transaction was the purchase of a 70 townhouse complex in Houston for $8.8 million in March of 2013.  Since then, Arel Capital has closed 28 transactions, representing about $1.5 billion worth of real-estate in five cities (New York, Houston, Denver, Austin and Charlotte).  More than 150 limited partners, including high net worth individuals, family offices and institutional investors, have invested in Arel Capital transactions.
