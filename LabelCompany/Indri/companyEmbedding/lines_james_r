Our History


The Electric Century
Even a true visionary like Thomas A. Edison could not have imagined the level of sophistication that would be required of equipment used for the transmission and distribution of electric power a little more than a century after its invention. Nor could he have anticipated all of the complex issues facing the electrical industry as it moves into the twenty-first century.
With the only research and development lab in the industry still named after this prodigious inventor, The Thomas A. Edison Technical Center, Cooper Power Systems is proud to trace its heritage back to this industry pioneer. Thomas A. Edison, Incorporated, one of Thomas Edison’s original companies, combined with McGraw Electric Company in 1957 to form McGraw-Edison. In 1985, McGraw-Edison became part of Cooper Power Systems.
Since its formation in 1985, Cooper Power Systems has continued the commitment of its forebears to innovation. The Thomas A. Edison Technical Center embodies Edison’s philosophy of finding a better way.
Cooper Power Systems roots, like any family tree, come from multiple sources: Kyle, Line Material, McGraw-Edison, RTE and Kearney. Each company played a key role in the development of modern distribution systems. Many of the common pieces of equipment and practices in use today were developed by these companies. Here is a brief overview of Cooper Power Systems heritage.




Show all     Hide all






Kyle Corporation





Kyle Corporation started as Electrical Connectors and Manufacturing Company in 1933. In the early 1940’s, Kyle marketed a number of innovative circuit reclosers under the Kyle brand. The brand would become the industry leader in reclosers, sectionalizers and switchgear. In 1947 Kyle merged with Line Material Company.

Founded in 1920[2] in Wooster, Ohio as the Wooster Rubber Company by nine businessmen. Originally Wooster Rubber Company manufactured toy balloons.[3]
In 1933, James R. Caldwell and his wife received a patent for their blue rubber dustpan. They called their line of rubber kitchen products Rubbermaid.[4]
In 1934 Ebert saw Rubbermaid products at a New England department store, and believed such products could help his struggling Wooster Rubber. He engineered a merger of the two enterprises in July 1934. Still named the Wooster Company, the new group began to produce rubber household products under the Rubbermaid brand name.
In 1999, Rubbermaid was purchased by Newell for $6 billion. Then Newell changed its name to Newell Rubbermaid Inc.[5]
In 2003, the company announced its move out of Wooster to Atlanta, Georgia; 850 manufacturing and warehouse jobs would be eliminated, and 409 office jobs would move to other locations. A Rubbermaid distribution center remained at the former headquarters for some time, until it was recently purchased by GOJO Industries, Inc.[6]
On Nov. 16th 2004, Rubbermaid was used as a prime example in the PBS Frontline documentary Is Walmart good for America.

Rubbermaid glass food storage containers.


Founded in 1920[2] in Wooster, Ohio as the Wooster Rubber Company by nine businessmen. Originally Wooster Rubber Company manufactured toy balloons.[3]
In 1933, James R. Caldwell and his wife received a patent for their blue rubber dustpan. They called their line of rubber kitchen products Rubbermaid.[4]
In 1934 Ebert saw Rubbermaid products at a New England department store, and believed such products could help his struggling Wooster Rubber. He engineered a merger of the two enterprises in July 1934. Still named the Wooster Company, the new group began to produce rubber household products under the Rubbermaid brand name.
In 1999, Rubbermaid was purchased by Newell for $6 billion. Then Newell changed its name to Newell Rubbermaid Inc.[5]
In 2003, the company announced its move out of Wooster to Atlanta, Georgia; 850 manufacturing and warehouse jobs would be eliminated, and 409 office jobs would move to other locations. A Rubbermaid distribution center remained at the former headquarters for some time, until it was recently purchased by GOJO Industries, Inc.[6]
On Nov. 16th 2004, Rubbermaid was used as a prime example in the PBS Frontline documentary Is Walmart good for America.

Getting Started

     A product line is a set of products that together address a particular market segment or fulfill a particular mission. Product lines are, of course, nothing new in manufacturing. Airbus builds one, and so do Ford, Dell, and even McDonald's. Each of these companies exploits commonality in different ways. Boeing, for example, developed the 757 and 767 transports in tandem, and the parts lists for these very two different aircraft overlap by about 60%, achieving significant economies of production and maintenance. But software product lines based on interproduct commonality are a relatively new concept that is rapidly emerging as a viable and important software development paradigm. Product flexibility is the anthem of the software marketplace, and product lines fulfill the promise of tailor-made systems built specifically for the needs of particular customers or customer groups. A product line succeeds because the commonalities shared by the software products can be exploited to achieve economies of production. The products are built from common assets in a prescribed way.
Organizations are finding that this practice of building sets of related systems from common assets can yield remarkable quantitative improvements in productivity, time to market, product quality, and customer satisfaction. They are finding that a software product line can efficiently satisfy the current hunger for mass customization. Organizations that acquire, as opposed to build, software systems are finding that commissioning a set of related systems as a commonly developed product line yields economies in delivery time, cost, simplified training, and streamlined acquisition.
But along with the gains come risks. Using a product line approach constitutes a new technical strategy for the organization. Organizational and management issues constitute obstacles that are critical to overcome and often add more risk, because they are less obvious. Building a software product line and bringing it to market require a blend of skillful engineering as well as both technical and organizational management. Acquiring a software product line also requires this same blend of skills to position the supplier organizations, so they can effectively exploit the commonality of the incoming products, as well as lend sound technical oversight and monitoring to the development effort. These skills are necessary to overcome the pitfalls that may bring failure to an unsophisticated organization.You'll find examples of real software product lines listed in the Catalog of Software Product Lines. The examples cover
diverse domains and show the kind of improvements your organization can
achieve using a product line approach.
Software Product Lines: Practices and Patterns provides a framework of specific practices, with detailed case studies, to guide the implementation of product lines in your organization.
The Software Product Lines Essentials presentation provides a brief overview of the what, why, and how of product line concepts.The Framework for Software Product Line Practice describes a framework for product line development. It is an online product line encyclopedia; a web-based document describing the essential activities and practices, in both the technical and organizational areas. These activities and practices are those in which an organization must be competent before it can reap the maximum benefit from fielding a product line of software or software-intensive systems.The SEI publishes reports and technical notes that will help you become familiar with various aspects product line practice.

Overview

     A software product line (SPL) is a set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way.
Software product lines are emerging as a viable and important development paradigm allowing companies to realize order-of-magnitude improvements in time to market, cost, productivity, quality, and other business drivers. Software product line engineering can also enable rapid market entry and flexible response, and provide a capability for mass customization.  
We are working to make software product line practice a dependable low-risk high-payoff practice that combines the necessary business and technical approaches to achieve success. If you would like to gain expertise in these practices, see training in product lines.
Benefits
Product lines can help organizations overcome the problems caused by resource shortages. Organizations of all types and sizes have discovered that a product line strategy, when skillfully implemented, can produce many benefits—and ultimately give the organizations a competitive edge.  Example organizational benefits include:

Improved productivity by as much as 10x
Increased quality by as much as 10x
Decreased cost by as much as 60%
Decreased labor needs by as much as 87%
Decreased time to market (to field, to launch) by as much as 98%
Ability to move into new markets in months, not years
