Brian Dovey, Partner




	Brian has been a partner of Domain since 1988, where he has led innovative investments in life sciences companies.


	I do what I do primarily because the people - my partners, other VCs, entrepreneurs and all associated with creating new companies - are incredibly interesting and fun to be around. It's also a noble effort working to improve human health.



	Since joining Domain, he has served on the board of directors of more than 35 private and public companies and has been chairman of six. He is currently on the board of three public companies: Miramar Labs, Orexigen Therapeutics and REVA Medical, where he currently serves as chairman of the board.


	Prior to Domain, Brian was President of Rorer Group, now a part of sanofi-aventis. Previous to that, Brian was president of Survival Technology, a start-up medical products company whose sales growth placed it in the top ten of the Inc 100.  He received his B.A. in mathematics from Colgate University and his MBA from Harvard Business School.


	Brian was former chairman and currently serves on the board of directors of both the Center for Venture Education (Kauffman Fellows Program) and the Wistar Institute, a leader in preclinical bio-medical research in the non-profit sector.  He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of the La Jolla Playhouse.


	Brian served as chairman of the National Venture Capital Association. He is a trustee emeritus of Germantown Academy and is a former trustee of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing and the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute. He is also a former board member of the industry associations representing the medical device industry as well as the association representing consumer pharmaceuticals.
