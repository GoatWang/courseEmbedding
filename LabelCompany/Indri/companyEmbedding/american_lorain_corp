American Lorain Corporation Key Developments

NYSE MKT Grants American Lorain Corporation Extension To Regain Compliance With Continued Listing Standards
Jul 13 17
On July 7, 2017, American Lorain Corporation received a letter from NYSE MKT LLC indicating it has accepted the Company's business plan of compliance, which was submitted on May 26, 2017, and granted ALN an extension until October 18, 2017 to regain compliance with the Exchange's continued listing standards. As previously reported on April 24, 2017, ALN received notification from the staff of the Exchange indicating it had determined that the Company was not in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the "Company Guide"), due to the Company's failure to timely file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company expects to complete filing of its annual report for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and quarterly report for fiscal period ended March 30, 2017 as soon as possible. As part of the acceptance, the Company will be subject to periodic review by the exchange staff during the extension period covered by the plan. Failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the applicable extension period could result in the company's shares being delisted from the exchange. If the Company's common stock was ultimately delisted from the exchange, it would be expected to trade on the OTC Bulletin Board.


American Lorain Corporation Receives Non-Compliance Notice From NYSE MKT LLC 
Apr 24 17
On April 18, 2017, American Lorain Corporation (the "Company") received a letter from NYSE MKT LLC (the "Exchange") stating that the Exchange has determined that the Company is not in compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide (the "Company Guide") due to the Company's failure to timely file with the SEC its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The letter also states that the Company's failure to timely file its Annual Report on Form 10-K is a material violation of its listing agreement with the Exchange and, therefore, pursuant to Section 1003(d) of the Company Guide, the Exchange is authorized to suspend and, unless prompt corrective action is taken, remove the Company's securities from the Exchange. The Exchange has informed the Company that, in order to maintain its listing on the Exchange, the Company must, by May 18, 2017, submit a plan of compliance (the "Plan") advising the Exchange of actions it has taken or will take to regain compliance with Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide by October 18, 2017 (the "Plan Period"). If the Plan is accepted by the Exchange, then the Company will be able to continue its listing during the Plan Period, during which time it will be subject to periodic monitoring for compliance with the Plan. If the Company does not submit a Plan or the Company's Plan is not accepted by the Exchange, then the Company will be subject to delisting proceedings. Furthermore, if the Plan is accepted by the Exchange, but the Company is not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the Company Guide by October 18, 2017, or if the Company does not make progress consistent with the Plan during the Plan Period, then the Exchange staff will initiate delisting proceedings as appropriate.


American Lorain Corporation announced delayed annual 10-K filing
Mar 30 17
On 03/30/2017, American Lorain Corporation announced that they will be unable to file their next 10-K by the deadline required by the SEC.

American Lorain Corporation Launches Lunch Box Products in 550 7-Eleven® Convenience Stores

Junan County, China--(April 30, 2010) - American Lorain 
Corporation (NYSE Amex: ALN) ("American Lorain" or the "Company"), an 
international processed snack foods and convenience food manufacturer based in 
the Shandong Province, China today announced that 550 7-Eleven convenience 
stores in Guangzhou, China began selling Lorain®-branded Lunch Box 
products.
American Lorain entered into a supplier agreement with 7-Eleven 
in March 2010 and for the last month has executed a roll-out of its 
ready-to-heat-and-eat Lunch Box products to 550 7-Eleven stores located in the 
city of Guangzhou, China. Lorains Lunch Box is a rice-based meal which 
includes a protein and a vegetable as part of the packaged meal. The entire meal 
is sealed and sterilized using Lorains proprietary technology that preserves 
product freshness and flavor. Consumers heat the meal at work or home in a 
microwave oven, open the package and eat the food. Consumers can choose from a 
variety of Lorain®- branded Lunch Box products and meal flavors in the 
refrigerated aisles of 7-Eleven stores. 
In additional to Lunch Box products, American Lorain has 
several additional convenience type foods currently under review by 7-Eleven 
including; chestnuts, pickled vegetables and candied beans. The Companys 
candied beans product was launched recently with a nationwide advertising 
campaign featuring Taiwanese actor Youpeng Alec Su.
We anticipate favorable results from the Lunch Box rollout 
to 7-Eleven stores in Guangzhou and hope to expand our product offerings to 
7-Eleven as our relationship grows, said American Lorain Chairman and CEO Si 
Chen. 7-Eleven has always been a target customer for us because of their strict 
product quality requirements, convenience shopping model and its large customer 
base. We expect that selling our products at 7-Eleven convenience stores will 
help drive incremental revenue growth, strengthen our brand awareness and 
increase our popularity amongst Chinese convenience food shoppers. Chen 
concluded.

American Lorain Corporation Announces Acquisition of Controlling Interest in Europe Based Chestnut Manufacturer and Distributor

Feb 13, 2014, 11:08 ET
		  		  							
						 from   American Lorain Corporation 











 
















































 

 




















 


LINYI, China, Feb. 13, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- American Lorain Corporation (NYSE MKT: ALN) ("American Lorain" or the "Company"), an international processed snack foods, convenience foods, and frozen foods company based in the Shandong Province, China, today announced that it has acquired 51% share capital in Athena Group ("Athena"), a France based prepared foods manufacturer and distributor with a diversified product portfolio including chestnuts, bean sprouts, as well as a variety of other Asian imported food products, for an aggregate cash consideration of €1,500,000, or approximately US$2,032,050.
The Athena Group was founded in 1968 and currently operates two factories based in France and one factory in Portugal. It is a leading brand and one of the largest producer of canned chestnuts and bean sprouts products in France. The France operation owns two highly automated production lines which are considered Europe-leading in technology and capacity. The Portuguese factory was established in 2013 and is located near Portugal's main chestnut producing region, which is essential to sufficient supply of raw materials given the falling chestnut output in Europe in recent years.
Meanwhile, Athena is currently one of the largest suppliers of Asian foods to French supermarket chains and has a variety of imports such as coconut milk, noodle, soy sauce, and rice paper from China, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.
After over 40 years of development, Athena's sales channel now covers over 80% of the supermarket chains in France and besides sales generated under its own brand, it is also a main supplier for private brand chestnut, bean sprout and imported Asian food products for big supermarket such as Carrefour and Auchan in France.
Mr. Si Chen, Chairman and CEO of American Lorain, commented: "We are extremely pleased to announce to investors this acquisition in France. American Lorain has been giving increasing emphasis in recent years to building a stronger international sales network and this acquisition marks the other important step for American Lorain along with our sustained marketing and operating efforts in Japan as well as domestic China. France is in a central position in Europe's food supply as well as logistics, and this acquisition will potentially enable American Lorain to achieve a strategic command of the whole chestnut industry value chain in Europe, yielding significant synergy together with American Lorain's China operations. We will provide strong support for raw material as well as procurement of Asian food supplies in China, and will also be able to take full advantage of Athena's existing sales channels in Europe to supply not only chestnuts but also other food products desired by the European market. American Lorain and Athena will jointly work in this strategic chance to develop new products with reduced cost in Europe's chestnut and Asian foods market, and strengthen its leading position in Europe."
