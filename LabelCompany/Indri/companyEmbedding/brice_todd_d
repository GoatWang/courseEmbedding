Charles G. Urtin
Chairman of S&T and S&T Bank 




Charles G. Urtin, 70, has served as Chairman of S&T and S&T Bank since 2013 and was formerly Vice Chairman of S&T and S&T Bank from 2008 to 2013. Mr. Urtin is a member of the Audit Committee. Mr. Urtin is retired but was formerly president and chief executive officer of IBT Bancorp, Inc. and Irwin Bank. We believe that Mr. Urtin’s 40 years of banking experience, including serving as chief executive officer of IBT Bancorp and Irwin Bank, provides the S&T Board with valuable industry, strategic, financial and operational insight, and his long-standing presence as a leader of a regional bank operating in our geographic market assists the S&T Board with customer acquisition, credit risk analysis and loan portfolio management and qualifies him to serve as the Chairman of the S&T Board and on the Audit Committee.

Ms. Toretti has also been a board of director member for the EQT Corporation since October 2015. Ms. Toretti’s deep industrial and energy experience provides the S&T Board with a strategic outlook regarding lending and other commercial opportunities in these sectors, her experience of leading a family business allows her to offer the S&T Board valuable management perspective and credit risk assessment with respect to our industrial and oil and gas borrowers, and her board experience, including in the role of chairman, qualifies her to serve as Vice Chairman of the S&T Board and on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

With 31 years of banking experience, including 15 years of senior management experience at S&T, we believe that Mr. Brice’s deep industry knowledge and his expertise in our operations, commercial lending and corporate strategy provides the S&T Board with significant insight across a broad range of issues critical to our business.

Michael J. Donnelly, 59, has served as a director of S&T since 2001 and is a member of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Mr. Donnelly has been president of Indiana Printing and Publishing Company, Inc. since 1993. We believe that Mr. Donnelly’s deep experience in managing and operating a local business provides the S&T Board with valuable insight into the issues addressing our local corporate and consumer borrowers. Mr. Donnelly has spent over 27 years working with the Indiana County Chamber of Commerce and the Indiana County Development Corporation in retaining and attracting many businesses in the Indiana, PA area. Mr. Donnelly’s experience in developing appropriate compensation for the executives and senior management of his company qualifies him to serve on our Compensation and Benefits Committee, and his experience on the S&T Board provides him with a solid background for service on our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

James T. Gibson, 61, has served as a director of S&T since March 2015.

Mr. Gibson assisted the S&T Board with transition and integration issues following the acquisition of Integrity in 2015, and retired December 31, 2015. Previously, Mr. Gibson served as president and chief executive officer of Commerce Bank/Harrisburg from 1988 to 2002. We believe that Mr. Gibson’s more than 37 years of banking experience and detailed knowledge about the development and operations of Integrity Bank qualify him to serve on our Board.

Jeffrey D. Grube, 63, has served as a director of S&T since 1997 and is Chairman of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and a member of the Audit Committee. Mr. Grube has served as president of B.F.G. Electroplating and Manufacturing Company as well as B.F.G. Manufacturing Service, Inc. since 1990. Mr. Grube’s career as an executive in the manufacturing industry includes financial and engineering experience. Mr. Grube’s extensive experience working with small and medium-sized businesses provides the S&T Board with valuable experience regarding potential borrowers and customers, customer relations, lending issues and credit risk. Mr. Grube also served as a director on the board of a privately held company that supplies compliance products for lending solutions. Mr. Grube’s executive and board experience in the manufacturing sector and experience with financial institutions allow him to bring relevant insight regarding regulatory and financial compliance issues to the S&T Board, including the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Benefits Committee.

Mr. Hostetter previously served on the board of Integrity from 2011 until it was acquired by S&T in March 2015.

Mr. Jones joined the S&T Board following the acquisition of People’s Bank of Unity, a regional financial institution, where he served on the board of directors. Mr. Jones assisted the S&T Board with integration and strategic issues following the acquisition. Mr. Jones’ legal practice, which focuses on estate administration and estate litigation, allows him to provide valuable insight to the S&T Board specifically with respect to our Wealth Management division, including on such issues as customer acquisition, marketing, strategic considerations, compliance and legal risk. We believe that Mr. Jones’ experience as a director of a similar bank to S&T Bank, together with his legal experience as it relates to one of our core businesses and his years of experience on the S&T Board, qualifies him to serve as a director and serve on our Audit Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 





Robert E. Kane

Mr. Kane also served on S&T Bank’s Indiana Regional Advisory Board from 2012 to 2016. In addition to his sound leadership capabilities, Mr. Kane has attained a deep knowledge of the financial services industry throughout his career. We believe that Mr. Kane’s executive management experience and detailed knowledge of the financial and e-commerce sectors qualify him to serve on our Board.

David L. Krieger, 73, has served as a director of S&T since 2007. Mr. Krieger has been retired since 2007 but was formerly Senior Executive Vice President and Commercial Lending Group Manager of S&T and S&T Bank. We believe that Mr. Krieger’s 24 years of experience at S&T, including leading our commercial lending group, adds valuable experience to the S&T Board. Mr. Krieger has deep knowledge of our lending practices and our customer base, and his commercial lending experience, both at S&T and at his prior employer, provides the S&T Board with significant operational insights regarding credit risk.

James C. Miller, 71, has served as a director of S&T since 1993. Mr. Miller served as Chairman of S&T and S&T Bank from 2004 to 2013. Mr. Miller is retired but was formerly Chief Executive Officer of S&T and S&T Bank from 1998 until 2008 and President of S&T and S&T Bank from 1993 until 2005. We believe that Mr. Miller’s banking experience, including 37 years with S&T or a bank acquired by S&T and his service as our former chief executive officer, provides him with a unique perspective of our business, including our markets, customer base, senior management, key employees, potential customers, and operations and finances, and qualifies him to serve on the S&T Board.

Mr. Palermo played an integral role in forming Gateway Bank of Pennsylvania where he served as chairman of the audit committee from its inception in 2004 through the date S&T acquired GatewayBank in 2012. Mr. Palermo’s career also includes 38 years in public accounting and four years as a vice president and controller at a community bank. We believe that Mr. Palermo’s background in accounting and finance, as well as his prior bank audit committee experience, bring a valuable perspective to the S&T Board both with respect to accounting, financial and strategic aspects of S&T’s business and to the Audit Committee on which he serves as “audit committee financial expert.” We further believe that Mr. Palermo’s extensive board experience qualifies him to be a member of the S&T Board and to serve on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
