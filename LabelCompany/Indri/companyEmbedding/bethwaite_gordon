Guardion Health SciencesGuardion Health Sciences, a leading provider of verifiable, validated and proprietary solutions in the areas of Ocular Health, is pleased to announce the appointment of Gordon Bethwaite to the role of Vice President, Sales and Marketing.
"We are excited to welcome Gordon to our team. He brings with him a wealth of expertise, knowledge and experience in the ophthalmic industry" said Michael Favish, CEO, Guardion Health Sciences (GHS). "As we enter into this exciting phase of growth for GHS, Gordon’s years of successful collaboration with leading doctors in the field, will enable him to develop an effective and dynamic sales team. As VP of Sales and Marketing, Gordon will be responsible for building and executing our business strategy and contributing to making GHS a globally revered and respected company."
Gordon joins GHS having most recently served as Director of Marketing for Carl Zeiss Meditec, a global leader and innovator in the ophthalmology & optometry industry. Speaking at the time of his appointment, Gordon said “I’m excited with the opportunity to assist GHS address a market need that, with the aging demographic we are experiencing, will become increasingly important as we seek to advise both healthcare professionals, and the public on the importance of the macular protective pigment and its relevance to macular degeneration and other ocular diseases. There is a global epidemic of macular degeneration and GHS is perfectly placed to serve both the national and international markets by providing the first evidence based protocol for treating a depleted macular protective pigment.
The protocol combines the diagnostic capability of the MapcatSF and the medical food (Lumega-Z) to replenish and restore the macular pigment.” “Throughout my career, I have taken pride in my ability to analyze and understand key opportunities available in the market, and to successfully leverage those opportunities by providing physicians with the knowledge and tools they need to serve their patients. My responsibilities have covered all the ophthalmic specialties, including retina, glaucoma, cataract and refractive, and this experience has furnished me with a great combination of application and strategic knowledge. I look forward to using my experience to contribute to developing this global and dynamic market establishing GHS as a significant ocular health company.”

Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. completes registration with SEC, becomes a Public Reporting Company






























Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. completes registration with SEC, becomes a Public Reporting Company


SAN DIEGO, CA - 01/04/2017 (PRESS RELEASE JET) — On December 27, 2016, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission declared effective the Registration Statement on Form S-1
(No. 333-209488) of Guardion Health Sciences, Inc. (“Guardion” or the “Company”). Accordingly, Guardion is now a public reporting company.
Michael Favish, the founder and CEO of Guardion, commented, “This news brings to a close a year of accomplishment for Guardion. We received recognition in several highly
respected ocular health publications. Our trademark registrations have been issued for Guardion®, MapcatSF® and Lumega-Z®. On November 8, 2016, the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office issued patent number 9,486,136 for our MapcatSF® medical device.” Mr. Favish continued, “In the upcoming year, we intend to begin the evaluation of
potential acquisitions of synergistic and ‘value added’ technologies that may be interested in becoming part of a public company. We will seek to continue to raise new
capital through the sale of our equity securities to fund our operations. We also intend to take steps in 2017 to create a public market for our stock, and we are continuing to
interview prospective market makers.”
Mr. Favish concluded, “Our focus will be on age-related eye disease and vision performance in 2017. We believe that Guardion is poised for significant growth, as we
continue to address the growing need for early detection and intervention with respect to age-related macular degeneration and other retinal diseases. With the combination of
our existing intellectual property portfolio, and strategically selected additional technologies, Guardion is well-positioned to achieve its immediate and longer term
objectives.”
This press release does not constitute an offer of our securities for sale, which can only be made by means of definitive offering documents.
