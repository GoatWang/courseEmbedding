David J. Brunnert, P.E. COO

David Brunnert is a proven leader in the oilfield service industry.  His most recent role was as the SVP for the Western Hemisphere for Franks International.  In this role, he lead the “good to great” transformation for more than half of the enterprise.  Notwithstanding the difficult market conditions, he was successful at retaining strong market shares in the Gulf of Mexico (50%) and US Land (30%+).  Prior to that, he was the COO of Express Energy services where he restructured the company, reduced cost, improved client alignment, and added sufficient value to sell the enterprise to Apollo Global Management.  Before Express, David was the Global VP of Drilling Tools and Intervention Services at Weatherford.  These businesses accounted for more than $1.6 Billion in revenue.  David was responsible for leading this business unit including setting the strategy and managing the sizable P&L.  While in this role he added new product offerings in Wellbore Cleaning and Borehole Enlargement.  Prior to that, he served in a number of leadership roles within Weatherford including Operations Management and New Product Development and Commercialization.  He got his start in the oilfield as a Product Engineer at Houston Engineers where he designed, manufactured and provided field support for drilling and fishing tools.
David’s career started as an officer in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  In this capacity he served in various leadership roles in the 82d Airborne Division.  This included a deployment to Saudi Arabia and Iraq as part of Desert Shield/Desert Storm.
In addition to being an accomplished leader, David is also an accomplished engineer.  He earned a BSME from West Point in 1989 and a Masters of Mechanical Engineering from the University of Houston in 1999.  He is an inventor on over 40 patents and has authored numerous publications and presentations.

In one embodiment, the drilling assembly is provided with a third fluid flow path. After drilling has been completed, wellbore lining conduit may be cemented in the wellbore.

METHOD OF FORMING A BORE



Publication number:  20160153238
                                            

Abstract:  A method of forming a supported subterranean well bore in which, in one disclosed embodiment, a first drill bit is mounted on a first string of casing tubulars via a steerable tool, and the drill bit is used to form a first bore. Upon reaching the required depth the casing string is cemented in place to support the formed bore and a second drill bit is mounted on a second casing string and is inserted into the first casing string. The second drill bit is used to drill through the wall of the first casing string and proceed to form a second, deeper bore. Once the second drill bit has reached the required depth, the second casing string is cemented in place to support the second bore.

Downhole deployment valves



Patent number:  8905140
                                            

Abstract:  Methods and apparatus enable reliable and improved isolation between two portions of a bore extending through a casing string disposed in a borehole. A downhole deployment valve (DDV) may provide the isolation utilizing a valve member, such as a flapper, that is disposed in a housing of the DDV and is designed to close against a seat within the housing. The DDV includes an operating mechanism for opening/closing the DDV. In use, pressure in one portion of a well that is in fluid communication with a well surface may be bled off and open at well surface while maintaining pressure in another portion of the casing string beyond the DDV.

EXTENDABLE CUTTING TOOLS FOR USE IN A WELLBORE



Publication number:  20140338976
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to extendable cutting tools for use in a wellbore. In one embodiment, a tool for use in a wellbore includes a tubular body having a bore therethrough, an opening through a wall thereof, and a connector at each longitudinal end thereof; and an arm. The arm is pivotally connected to a first piston and rotationally coupled to the body, is disposed in the opening in a retracted position, and is movable to an extended position where an outer surface of the arm extends outward past an outer surface of the body. The tool further includes the first piston. The first piston is disposed in the body bore, has a bore therethrough, and is operable to move the arm from the retracted position to the extended position in response to fluid pressure in the piston bore exceeding fluid pressure in the opening. The tool further includes a lock operable to retain the first piston in the retracted position; and a second piston operably coupled to the lock.

In one aspect, a drilling assembly having an earth removal member and a wellbore lining conduit is manipulated to advance into the earth. The drilling assembly includes a first fluid flow path and a second fluid flow path. Fluid is flowed through the first fluid flow path, and at least a portion of which may return through the second fluid flow path. In one embodiment, the drilling assembly is provided with a third fluid flow path. After drilling has been completed, wellbore lining conduit may be cemented in the wellbore.

DOWNHOLE DEPLOYMENT VALVES



Publication number:  20130319679
                                            

Abstract:  Methods and apparatus enable reliable and improved isolation between two portions of a bore extending through a casing string disposed in a borehole. A downhole deployment valve (DDV) may provide the isolation utilizing a valve member, such as a flapper, that is disposed in a housing of the DDV and is designed to close against a seat within the housing. The DDV includes an operating mechanism for opening/closing the DDV. In use, pressure in one portion of a well that is in fluid communication with a well surface may be bled off and open at well surface while maintaining pressure in another portion of the casing string beyond the DDV.

Extendable cutting tools for use in a wellbore



Patent number:  8540035
                                            

Abstract:  Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to extendable cutting tools for use in a wellbore. In one embodiment, a tool for use in a wellbore includes a tubular body having a bore therethrough, an opening through a wall thereof, and a connector at each longitudinal end thereof; and an arm. The arm is pivotally connected to a first piston and rotationally coupled to the body, is disposed in the opening in a retracted position, and is movable to an extended position where an outer surface of the arm extends outward past an outer surface of the body. The tool further includes the first piston. The first piston is disposed in the body bore, has a bore therethrough, and is operable to move the arm from the retracted position to the extended position in response to fluid pressure in the piston bore exceeding fluid pressure in the opening. The tool further includes a lock operable to retain the first piston in the retracted position; and a second piston operably coupled to the lock.
