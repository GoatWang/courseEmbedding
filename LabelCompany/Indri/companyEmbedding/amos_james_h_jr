A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Fiction isn't about the facts of events, but rather about the emotional truths that come from being human. The best novels teach the reader things about themselves that they could never have learned from personal experience.Collect the Classics of LiteratureLiterature has been around almost as long as language has. The plays of Aeschylus and Aristophanes are thousands of years old, and even those of Shakespeare are over four hundred. Antiquarian books not only look impressive on your bookshelf, but they let you see literature the way it was meant to be seen. They also make great collectibles, often growing in value over the years.Horror's One True KingFew names conjure a sense of horror on the page quite like Stephen King. Maine's prodigal son is one of the best known authors of the last half-century having written such bestsellers as "The Stand," "It," and "Salem's Lot." Known best for horror, King has the ability to capture an era of small town America like no author before or since. With King you can read the stories behind such movies as "Stand by Me," and even "The Shawshank Redemption."It's Just a Matter of GenreFrom romance to fantasy, and mystery to science fiction, fiction comes in a wide variety of genres. The beauty of reading genre fiction is that you always know what you're going to get. Every category romance has a happy ever after ending; that's the defining feature of the genre. Every mystery can be figured out through logical reasoning. It's all about finding the right story.Find the Right FormatFiction and Literature books come in three major formats: hardcover, trade paperback, and mass market paperback. Hardcovers are the largest, traditionally sewn together and built to last. Trade paperbacks are almost the size of hardcovers, and provide a balance between the bulk of a hardcover and the portability of a mass market paperback. Mass market paperbacks are the smallest of the three formats, designed to provide portable and often disposable fiction.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksFiction & Literature BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverPaperbackPublication Yearsee all1800-18991900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allAction, AdventureClassicsFantasyHorrorLiterature, ModernMystery, ThrillerRomanceScience FictionSpecial Attributessee all1st EditionDust JacketEx-LibraryIllustratedLarge PrintSignedLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

James H. Amos, Jr.







Posted Thu, 2009-02-05 17:50 by Mr. Blue MauMau 



Jim Amos, Source/P&G

Official bio for the media from Proctor & Gamble.
Jim Amos, Chairman and CEO of Tasti D-Lite LLC

Past Chairman:

The International Franchise Association
Mail Boxes Etc.


Chairman Emeritus: Mail Boxes Etc., now The UPS Store

 Author of three Bestsellers
Decorated Vietnam Veteran



Additionally, he has served on the boards of The National Veteran’s Administration, The Marine Military Academy, The Marine Corps Heritage Foundation, Meineke Car Care Centers, Oreck Corporation, Zig Ziglar Corporation, WSI of Canada, The University of Missouri, The International Franchise Association, The HealthStore Foundation and Ken Blanchard’s Faith Walk Leadership Foundation.
A graduate of the University of Missouri, Amos was honored as the 1998 scholar-in-residence and in 2000 and 2003 with the Distinguished Alumni Award. Recognized in “Marquis Who’s Who in America”, “Who’s Who in American Executives”, “Who’s Who in Finance and Industry”, “Who’s Who in American Authors” and “The International Authors and Writers Who’s Who”.
During his career, Mr. Amos has been a leader in the franchising industry. For eight years prior to joining MBE, he was the CEO of the Brice Group in Dallas. A former Marine Corps captain and veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam, Mr. Amos received 12 decorations, including the Purple Heart and Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He is the author of several books including the best sellers The Memorial, Focus or Failure: America at the Crossroads, The Transparent Leader, Corporate Giants, Above and Beyond, You Can Do It, The Entrepreneurs’ Creed and Living An Uncommon Life. In addition, Penguin Press published his latest work, The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Franchising.
Under Mr. Amos’ leadership as Chairman and CEO, Mail Boxes Etc. became the world’s largest and fastest growing franchisor of retail business, communication and postal service centers. Based in San Diego, the MBE Network comprised nearly 5,000 locations worldwide, with master licensing agreements in more than 80 countries around the world. In 2001, Amos was instrumental in orchestrating the sale of MBE to United Parcel Service who subsequently renamed the system, The UPS Store.
Tasti D-Lite is the #1 good-for-you dessert in the world within the fasted growing segment of the frozen dessert market. Mr. Amos has assembled a world class franchising team with the goal of 500 centers in five years.



James H. Amos Jr. and Snow Phipps Group, a New York-based private equity firm, acquired New York - based Tasti D-Lite on February 7, 2007, and Mr. Amos serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Source: This bio is courtesy of Proctor & Gamble. It was announced Feb 5, 2009 that Mr. Jim Amos would be chairman of the board for P&G's new franchising subsidiary, Agile Pursuits.
Controversy: Amos has a history of litigation with brands that he has led such as Brice Foods, Mail Boxes Etc. (now The UPS Store) and Sona Medspa. His name often creates strong reactions from self-declared franchise owners on the franchise blogosphere. Much of the anger from franchise owners are accusations of fraud. For example, there's mention of him on the Blogosphere at FranchisePerfection, FranchisePundit, Tasti D-Lited, BizOp.ca, Blue MauMau and even more traditional journals like Franchise Times take note of this.
Franchise attorney Michael Webster published 4 pages of lawsuits against Jim Amos (pdf) from law research service Pacer. It shows litigation issues with Jim Amos from MBE, Sona Medspa, Brice Foods (I Can't Believe It's Yogurt) and many other brands.
Amos and other leaders of Sona Medspa were recently found guilty of negligent misrepresentation to franchise owners.
Besides the lawsuit that relates to a gruesome death of teenagers in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt franchise, there is a lawsuit about conspiracy to defraud franchise investors at Brice Foods. Amos decided toward the end of the Brice trial to settle out of court. But the court in the Brice trial took the unusual step to state that Amos and colleagues "engaged in a conspiracy (pdf, see pg 6 of 20) to defraud investors (franchise buyers) commencing in May of 1992. Brice was found guilty.
Proctor & Gamble acquires Carnett's car washes: On July 1, 2009, 13 Carnett's car wash locations were converted to Mr. Clean Car Wash. Agile Pursuits Franchising, Inc., an attempt by Proctor & Gamble to try out franchising, announced the acquisition of Carnett's Car Wash company assets in February 2009. Carnett's is an Atlanta-based car wash chain. The conversion of Carnett's to Mr. Clean Car Wash brings the total number of car wash locations to 15, including two corporate-owned locations in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Professional Car Washing and Detailing
Executive director for the International Car Wash Association, Eric Wulf,  said he hopes the news of Proctor & Gamble launching a national car wash  franchise in the middle of a credit crunch shows carwash operators and new  investors that “even in tough times, you cannot stop investing.” The  editor-in-chief of Professional CarWashing and Detailing writes about  the naysayers of Blue MauMau:
"The  Blue MauMau, a website devoted to franchise news and research, is  questioning Procter & Gamble’s decision to place Jim Amos, chairman and CEO of  Tasti D-Lite, former chairman and CEO of Mail Boxes Etc. (now The UPS Store) and  past chairman of the International Franchise Association (IFA) as the head of  its franchising board.

Those organizations and credentials do sound impressive.
According to the Feb. 5 article in the Blue Mau Mau, Amos has a “history of  litigation” with I Can't Believe It's Yogurt and Sona  Medspa and his name “creates numerous strong reactions from self-declared  franchise owners on the franchise blogosphere.”
The article did not specify the details or the outcomes of the alleged  lawsuits brought against Amos or the companies. An internet search shows that in  the early 1990s, Amos was involved  in a lawsuit after four  teenage customers were killed at an I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt  franchise.
The Blue Mau Mau did not say what caused the "strong reactions from  self-declared franchise owners," either.

Amos
Do not business with him or the daughter. Is she Heather Rose involved with Tasti D lite? She soon follows in his ventures. The web has lots of information regarding Ms. Rose and Sona Med Spas. I read the lawsuits thanks for the link. You are right on.

Pacer Lawsuits
I emailed the editor a section from Pacer which outlined 7 lawsuits Amos was involved in having to do with franchising.  And I wrote a small article  about it, after the article was published, the editor wrote back and thanked me for the report from Pacer.
