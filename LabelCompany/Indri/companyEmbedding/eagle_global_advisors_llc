About Eagle









Eagle Global Advisors, LLC is a registered investment advisor located in Houston, Texas. The firm was founded in November, 1996 and was registered with the SEC that same year.  The firm is 100% owned by its employees and organized as a Texas Limited Liability corporation. 

                                  The three principal owners are Edward R. Allen III, Ph.D., CFA, Thomas N. Hunt III, CFA, CPA  and Steven S. Russo.  Additionally, there are two employee owners: John F. Gualy, CFA and Malcom S. Day, CFA.  The firm has only one location which is in Houston, Texas, and is not related to any other organizations.





Our Clientele


Investment Management is our core competency.  Eagle Global Advisors, LLC serves as investment advisor to both individuals and institutions including:



Corporate and Public Pension Plans

Mutual Funds

High Net Worth Individuals
Trusts, Endowments and Foundations
Family Offices
 





 Eagle Global Advisors works with clients in one of two ways:  via traditional relationships with clients who work with us directly, or via indirect relationships where an intermediary-financial consultant or advisor-knows and works with the client.  While Eagle has many direct clients – a significant number of whom have been with the firm since day one – We have deliberately grown our business by seeking strategic partnerships with financial intermediaries.  Doing so allows Eagle to gain operational leverage that allows the firm to focus its resources, both financial and human, on Eagle’s core competency –managing money.





Our History


Eagle Global Advisors, LLC was formed in November of 1996 and has been 100% employee owned since inception.  Four of the founding partners had previously worked together as a team for several years at a predecessor firm – where they had been hired specifically to develop an international equity strategy.  First in 1994 and again in 1996, that firm experienced two ownership changes in two years.  At that time, the group decided to leave and form their own firm, Eagle Global Advisors, LLC.

                                  What started with four partners and one administrator has grown to an organization of over 26 people, offering multiple products to a full spectrum of clients.  It is important to note that throughout the last 14 years the firm has maintained its independence – it remains, and has a goal to continue to be, an employee-owned organization.  Eagle believes that independence enables the freedom to always keep the interest of clients ahead of all others – a belief the firm views as a critical differentiating factor when comparing Eagle to other advisors.





Today, Eagle offers managed investments in the following strategies:



U.S. Equity

International Equity

Global Equity
Balanced Equity
Fixed Income
Master Limited Partnerships
 





For qualified investors, Eagle offers  diversification through investments in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Eagle is one of the few firms to dedicate resources to managing investments in this arena.  The firm has managed MLP portfolios using the same disciplined process since 2002, capitalizing on the firm’s location in Houston, Texas, which is home to more than half of all MLP capitalization.   As an early mover in MLPs, the Firm has a reputation as a leader in this unique and growing asset class.





Mutual Funds


Eagle global Advisors, LLC maintain a strategic alliance with Eaton Vance that was forged in April 2004 when the firm was selected to be the sub-advisor for one of Eaton Vance’s international equity mutual funds. Since that time, Eagle has taken on the same role for other Eaton Vance sponsored funds. Additionally, Eaton Vance has an exclusive agreement to market Eagle’s separately managed international Equity strategy to broker-dealer sponsored wrap programs.

About Eagle









Our Clientele


Investment management is our core competency. Eagle Global Advisors, LLC serves as an investment advisor to a wide spectrum of both individual and institutional investors.

 




 Eagle works with clients in one of two ways:  via traditional relationships with clients who work with us directly, or via indirect relationships where an intermediary (financial consultant or advisor) knows and works with the client.  While Eagle has many direct clients – a significant number of whom have been with the firm since day one – We have deliberately grown our business by seeking strategic partnerships with financial intermediaries.  Doing so allows Eagle to gain operational leverage that allows the firm to focus its resources, both financial and human, on Eagle’s core competency – managing money.





Our History


Eagle Global Advisors, LLC was formed in November of 1996 and has been 100% employee owned since inception.  Four of the founding partners had previously worked together as a team for several years at a predecessor firm – where they had been hired specifically to develop an international equity strategy.  First in 1994 and again in 1996, that firm experienced two ownership changes.  At that time, the group decided to leave and form their own firm, Eagle Global Advisors, LLC.

                                  It is important to note that throughout the firm's history it has maintained its independence – the firm remains, and has a goal to continue to be, an employee-owned organization.  Eagle believes that independence enables the freedom to always keep the interest of clients ahead of all others – a belief the firm views as a critical differentiating factor when comparing Eagle to other advisors.





Today, Eagle offers managed investments in the following strategies:



U.S. Equity

International Equity

Global Equity
Balanced Equity
Master Limited Partnerships
 





For qualified investors, Eagle offers  diversification through investments in Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).  Eagle is one of the few firms to dedicate resources to managing investments in this arena.  The firm has managed MLP portfolios using the same disciplined process since 2003, capitalizing on the firm’s location in Houston, Texas, which is home to more than half of all MLP capitalization.   As an early mover in MLPs, the firm has a reputation as a leader in this unique and growing asset class.
