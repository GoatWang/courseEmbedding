Lapin Law Offices, P.C. provides a full range of legal services to individuals, families, real estate investors, and small businesses in the Dallas / Fort Worth, Texas Metroplex.  We are also available to provide legal services on select legal matters throughout the entire state of Texas, as well as legal and litigation support services nationwide.For more information about the services we offer please visit our Legal Services page, or contact us at (972) 292-7425.Although fees and fee structures for any particular legal matter will depend on a number of factors, the following general information summarizes those fees and fee structures:

Flat Rate FeesIn order to provide clients with as much predictability and control over their legal fees as is reasonably possible, Lapin Law Offices, P.C. offers flat-rate fees for many legal services, including business law services (incorporation and other transactional business law services), criminal defense, divorce (agreed), estate planning, real estate law services (transactional and certain litigation services), as well as for many other routine legal services where the nature and complexity of the legal work to be performed is known or can reasonably be estimated prior to the delivery of those services.


Back to the Top



Hourly Rate FeesLegal matters that are accepted on an hourly rate fee basis (typically contested litigation matters) are subject to a minimum fee (which is determined on a case-by-case basis) and a requirement that a refundable retainer against future fees be maintained on deposit with the law firm.  As with all legal matters, clients are provided with regular, periodic billings which contain a detailed description of the legal work which was performed on their legal matter.


Back to the Top



Contingency FeesOur law firm does not accept cases on a contingency fee basis.


Back to the Top



“Free” Initial ConsultationsOften, the “free” initial consultations that many attorneys and law firms offer are really nothing more than an opportunity for a lawyer to persuade a potential client to sign a fee contract and pay a substantial retainer.  Any “free” legal advice that the client might obtain is provided only after the client signs a fee contract and pays a fee.It has been our experience at Lapin Law Offices that many clients who come to see us for an initial consultation are best served by a course of action that does not necessarily require expensive legal services.  In such cases, a client may need only to consult with an attorney to gain a better or clearer understanding of the relevant legal concepts which apply to the client’s matter, as well as the practical, economic realities which might affect the client’s case.Because we use initial consultations to provide clients with the knowledge they need to make sound decisions — and not as an opportunity to try to sell clients expensive legal services that they may not need — we are unable to offer “free” consultations.  However, clients who do consult with us can be confident that their consultation is, in fact, a consultation, and not a lawyer’s sales pitch.We encourage prospective clients to schedule an initial consultation before taking any actions that might affect their legal rights, such as speaking with any third party, meeting with law enforcement, or signing any legal document.  During your initial consultation, we will briefly review your legal rights and responsibilities, summarize available courses of action, and discuss legal fees associated with the various alternatives.

Welcome to Lapin Law Offices
At Lapin Law Offices we care about our clients, have a passion for what we do and are dedicated to obtaining justice for the people we represent. We let our clients focus on what is most important, their health. Our job is to protect our client’s interests, help in any way we can, and make sure our clients get everything they are entitled to.
                
We pride ourselves on the relationships we establish with our clients.  Throughout the case, we regularly contact our clients to see how they are doing and if they need anything. We firmly believe that the more our client’s know about what we do and about the process, they become less frustrated and are better equipped to make educated, informed decisions.
Some firms treat clients as just another paycheck. These attorneys refuse to go to trial and force clients to take whatever an insurance company will offer. Lapin Law Offices is different. We understand it is your case and, hopefully, the only one you will ever have. We will, of course, offer our advice but the ultimate decision whether to settle or proceed to trial is yours. We do not fear insurance companies or their attorneys. Some cases do have to be tried and the attorneys at Lapin Law Offices all have considerable courtroom experience.
We protect our clients from being bullied, whether by an insurance company or debt collector. We have recently expanded our practice to represent clients that have been harassed, abused or treated unfairly by debt collectors as well as other abuses involving cell phones, faxes and unfair credit reporting actions. You can more about these cases at our other site, StopBadCollectors.com.
When your case is concluded we want you to have been satisfied with how you were represented. We want you to feel comfortable recommending us to family or friends if they have been injured, harassed, abused or wrongfully denied benefits.
Our areas of practice include: vehicle accidents (automobile, heavy truck, motorcycle, pedestrians, passengers, recreational and farm vehicles); workers’ compensation, dog bites; wrongful death; Social Security Disability (SSDI and SSI); Uninsured (UM) and Underinsured Motorist (UIM) claims; breach of insurance contract and bad faith; nursing home abuse and neglect; medical malpractice; injuries on property; unfair debt collection (FDCPA), telephone and fax abuses (TCPA), unfair credit reporting actions (FCRA), claims against the government; unemployment compensation appeals; and many other types of cases. We also represent the families of those killed due to the neglect or actions of any person or company.
We offer a free initial consultation to discuss your case. If we believe we can help, we will offer to represent you. If we do not believe it is in either your or our best interest to represent you we will offer suggestions on how to handle your case or recommend someone else you can talk to about your case.
Most cases are accepted on a contingency fee basis; if we do not collect money for you we do not receive any fee.
Call us at (402) 421-8033 (Lincoln) or (888) 525-8819 (toll free) twenty four hours a day seven days a week (24/7) for a free initial consultation. You can also electronically Chat with us or submit your case by completing the Contact Us form. We will reply, either by email or telephone, as soon as we can.
Lapin Law Offices represents clients with caring, passionate and dedication throughout Nebraska including such cities as Lincoln, Omaha, Beatrice, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, Columbus, Nebraska City, Aurora, North Platte, York, Norfolk, Seward, Fairbury, and counties such as Lancaster, Seward, Douglas, Sarpy, Gage, Otoe, Saunders, York, Hall, Buffalo, Lincoln, Cass, Platte and Madison.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Young Family Affordability Rankings
Supported by emerging careers, our young family is headed by an interpreter and a personal care aide—a 26-year-old husband and his 27-year-old wife, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that over the next years, personal care aides and interpreters will remain two of the nation's fastest-growing careers, which suit the young parents who run our household. The family includes a 2-year-old child and maintains a Low-Cost Food Plan. In order to rank the cities according to annual affordability, we consider our young family's preferred housing characteristics: a house or an apartment that's 1,750 square feet, including two (or three) bedrooms, is a desirable home for our young family. Results are applicable to other households whose annual incomes fit within the range of earnings for the demographic.
We rank each city by calculating the percentage of affordable housing preferred by our young family. Cities are grouped into affordability brackets, based on the demographic's annual household income and realistic cost of living, and then sorted by discretionary income, which is the yearly amount remaining from earnings after covered expenses. Annual household income draws on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and the realistic cost of living derives from our formula of seven factors—housing, food, utilities, child care, taxes, health care and transportation. Our full methodology is available here.


Analysis of the Rankings for All Cities in Texas

For our young family, housing affordability varies significantly between 32 cities in Texas with populations of 100,000 or more. Our calculations show that the demographic earns an annual household income from $50,680 (Waco) to $81,210 (Austin), generates a cost of living of between $54,937 (Waco) and $75,644 (Austin), and ends with a discretionary income of up to $12,429 (El Paso) or an annual loss of as much as $10,663 (Midland).
Our young family's annual expenses exceed earnings in 19 midsize cities, where affordability is less than 60%. Austin, one of 10 large cities, offers the highest income, but El Paso, where the affordability is more than 90%, provides the largest discretionary income, which derives from annual earnings after covered expenses. As a result, El Paso tops our rankings, and has an edge over Round Rock, Pasadena, Killeen, Wichita Falls and Abilene, all of which are midsize cities with housing affordability of more than 90%. The costliest cities—Odessa, Amarillo, Waco and Carrollton—have less than 10% of affordable housing units.

Family Lawyers

   If you
              would like to be referred to a high profile Family Attorneys
              or law firms in your area, contact Attorney Search Network for a  California Lawyer Referral. 
              Family Law, specialized area of legal practice dealing with rights and duties among husbands, wives, and children.
DIVORCE
There are two types of divorce-- absolute and limited. An absolute divorce, (also called a "divorce a vinculo matrimonii" is a judicial termination of a marriage based on marital misconduct or other statutory cause arising after the marriage ceremony. As a result of an absolute divorce both parties' status becomes single again.
Several jurisdictions' statutes authorize limited divorces, or "divorce a mensa et thoro." The consequences of limited divorces vary from state to state. Typically, a limited divorce is commonly referred to as a separation decree; the right to cohabitation is terminated but the marriage is undissolved and the status of the parties is not altered.
Many states have enacted what is called no-fault divorce statutes. This is a response to outdated common law divorce which required proof in a court of law by the divorcing party that the divorcee had done one of several enumerated things as sufficient grounds for the divorce. This entailed proving that the spouse had committed adultery, or some other unsavory act. No-fault divorce eliminates this potentially embarrassing and undesirable requirement by providing for the dissolution of a marriage on a finding that the relationship is no longer viable. It is hard to tell whether no-fault divorce statutes are the cause or an effect of the rising national divorce rate in America. Look to various state laws for divorce law information.
CHILD CUSTODY
Generally, statutes authorize the court having jurisdiction of divorce proceedings to determine who shall have custody of children from the marriage. (The authority to do so is considered part of the original jurisdiction of the court, and not as a new authority being conferred upon them.) Under the common statutory provision, the parents of a child born within a marriage are joint guardians of that child and the rights of both parents are equal--each parent has an equal right to the custody of the child when they separate.
Like other aspects of family law, most law in this field is state rather than Federal.

Criminal Law

   If you would like to be referred to a Criminal Attorney in your area, contact Attorney Search Network for a California Lawyer Referral. 
              If you would like to be referred to High Profile Criminal Defense Lawyers and Criminal Defense Law Firms, contact Attorney Search Network.
A "crime" is any act or omission (of an act) in violation of a public law forbidding or commanding it. Crimes include both felonies (more serious offenses -- like murder or rape) and misdemeanors (like petty theft, or jaywalking). No act is a crime if it has not been previously established as such either by statute or common law.
Historically, most crimes have been established by state law, with laws varying significantly state to state. There is, however, a Model Penal Code (MPC) which serves as a good starting place to gain an understanding of the basic structure of criminal liability.
In recent years the list of Federal crimes has grown.
All statutes describing criminal behavior can be broken down into its various elements. Most crimes (with the exception of strict-liability crimes) consist of two elements: an act, or "actus reus" and a mental state, or "mens rea." Prosecutors have to prove each and every element of the crime to yield a conviction.

Learn more about Criminal Law
Criminal Law, branch of law that defines crimes, establishes punishments, and regulates the investigation and prosecution of people accused of committing crimes. Criminal law includes both substantive law, which is addressed in this article, and criminal procedure, which regulates the implementation and enforcement of substantive criminal law.
Substantive criminal law defines crime and punishment-for example, what act constitutes murder or what punishment a murderer should receive. On the other hand, criminal procedure is concerned with the legal rules followed and the steps taken to investigate, apprehend, charge, prosecute, convict, and sentence to punishment individuals who violate substantive criminal law. For example, criminal procedure describes how a murder trial must be conducted.
This article discusses criminal law in the context of the common law system, which is found in countries such as England, Canada, and the United States. In the common law system, judges decide cases by referring to principles set forth in previous judicial decisions. Common law systems are typically contrasted with civil law systems, which are found in most Western European countries, much of Latin America and Africa, and parts of Asia. In civil law systems, judges decide cases by referring to statutes, which are enacted by legislatures and compiled in comprehensive books called codes.
In legal systems based on common law, criminal law is distinguished from what is known as civil law. In this context, the term civil law refers to the rules regulating private relationships, such as marriage, contracts, and personal injuries. In contrast, criminal law governs actions and relationships that are deemed to harm society as a whole.
PURPOSE OF CRIMINAL LAW
Criminal law seeks to protect the public from harm by inflicting punishment upon those who have already done harm and by threatening with punishment those who are tempted to do harm. The harm that criminal law aims to prevent varies. It may be physical harm, death, or bodily injury to human beings; the loss of or damage to property; sexual immorality; danger to the government; disturbance of the public peace and order; or injury to the public health. Conduct that threatens to cause, but has not yet caused, a harmful result may be enough to constitute a crime. Thus, criminal law often strives to avoid harm by forbidding conduct that may lead to harmful results.
One purpose of both civil law and criminal law in the common law system is to respond to harmful acts committed by individuals. However, each type of law provides different responses. A person who is injured by the action of another may bring a civil lawsuit against the person who caused the harm. If the victim prevails, the civil law generally provides that the person who caused the injury must pay money damages to compensate for the harm suffered. A person who acts in a way that is considered harmful to society in general may be prosecuted by the government in a criminal case. If the individual is convicted (found guilty) of the crime, he or she will be punished under criminal law by either a fine, imprisonment, or death. In some cases, a person's wrongful and harmful act can invoke both criminal and civil law responses.
THEORIES OF CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT
Various theories have been advanced to justify or explain the goals of criminal punishment, including retribution, deterrence, restraint (or incapacitation), rehabilitation, and restoration. Sometimes punishment advances more than one of these goals. At other times, a punishment may promote one goal and conflict with another.
Retribution: The theory of retribution holds that punishment is imposed on the blameworthy party in order for society to vent its anger toward and exact vengeance upon the criminal. Supporters of this theory look upon punishment not as a tool to deter future crime but as a device for ensuring that offenders pay for past misconduct.
Deterrence: Those who support the deterrence theory believe that if punishment is imposed upon a person who has committed a crime, the pain inflicted will dissuade the offender (and others) from repeating the crime. When the theory refers to the specific offender who committed the crime, it is known as special deterrence. General deterrence describes the effect that punishment has when it serves as a public example or threat that deters people other than the initial offender from committing similar crimes.

                Restraint: Some believe that the goal of punishment is restraint. If a criminal is confined, executed, or otherwise incapacitated, such punishment will deny the criminal the ability or opportunity to commit further crimes that harm society.
Rehabilitation: Another possible goal of criminal punishment is rehabilitation of the offender. Supporters of rehabilitation seek to prevent crime by providing offenders with the education and treatment necessary to eliminate criminal tendencies, as well as the skills to become productive members of society.
Restoration: The theory of restoration takes a victim-oriented approach to crime that emphasizes restitution (compensation) for victims. Rather than focus on the punishment of criminals, supporters of this theory advocate restoring the victim and creating constructive roles for victims in the criminal justice process. For example, relatives of a murder victim may be encouraged to testify about the impact of the death when the murderer is sentenced by the court. Promoters of this theory believe that such victim involvement in the process helps repair the harm caused by crime and facilitates community reconciliation.
Conflicts Among Goals: The various justifications for criminal punishment are not mutually exclusive. A particular punishment may advance several goals at the same time. A term of imprisonment, for example, may serve to incapacitate the offender, deter others in society from committing similar acts, and, at the same time, provide an opportunity for rehabilitative treatment for the offender. On the other hand, the goals of punishment may at times conflict. The retributive and deterrence theories call for the infliction of unpleasant experiences upon the criminal, including harsh prison treatment; but the prison environment may not be conducive to, or may even defeat, rehabilitation.
No one theory of punishment addresses all the goals of criminal law. A combination of theories and goals plays a part in the thinking of the legislators who establish the ranges of punishment for various crimes, the judges and jurors who sentence offenders within these ranges, and the parole authorities who have the power to release certain prisoners.
CLASSIFICATION OF CRIMES
Crimes are classified in many different ways: common law crimes versus statutory crimes, and crimes that are mala in se (evil in themselves) versus those that are mala prohibita (criminal only because the law says so). An important classification is the division of crimes into felonies or misdemeanors. This distinction is based on the severity of the crime and is rooted in common law.
In many jurisdictions in the United States, felonies are crimes punishable by death or imprisonment in a state prison or penitentiary and misdemeanors are those punishable by fine or imprisonment in a local jail. (The term jurisdiction refers to the authority of a political entity, such as a state or a county, or the territory over which that authority is exercised.) In other jurisdictions, crimes punishable by imprisonment for one year or more are felonies, and those punishable by fine or imprisonment for less than one year are misdemeanors. Since each jurisdiction determines the penalties for offenses it defines, a misdemeanor in one jurisdiction may constitute a felony in another. Some jurisdictions have an additional classification for petty offenses, also called infractions, which are usually punishable by a small fine.

Torts - Personal Injury Law
   If you would like to be referred to a Torts - Personal Injury Attorney in your area, contact Attorney Search Network for a California Attorney Referral. 
              TORTS AND PERSONAL INJURY LAW
Torts are civil wrongs recognized by law as grounds for a lawsuit. These wrongs result in an injury or harm constituting the basis for a claim by the injured party. While some torts are also crimes punishable with imprisonment, the primary aim of tort law is to provide relief for the damages incurred and deter others from committing the same harms. The injured person may sue for an injunction to prevent the continuation of the tortious conduct or for monetary damages. Among the types of damages the injured party may recover are: loss of earnings capacity, pain and suffering, and reasonable medical expenses. They include both present and future expected losses.
There are numerous specific torts including trespass, assault, battery, negligence, products liability, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Torts fall into three general categories: intentional torts (e.g., intentionally hitting a person); negligent torts (causing an accident by failing to obey traffic rules); and strict liability torts (e.g., liability for making and selling defective products.) Intentional torts are those wrongs which the defendant knew or should have known would occur through their actions or inactions. Negligent torts occur when the defendant's actions were unreasonably unsafe. Strict liability wrongs do not depend on the degree of carefulness by the defendant, but are established when a particular action causes damage.
Tort law is state law created through judges (common law) and by legislatures (statutory law). Many judges and states utilize the Restatement of Torts (2nd) as an influential guide. The Restatement is a publication prepared by the American Law Institute whose aim is to present an orderly statement of the general law of the United States.
DAMAGES
Damages, in a legal sense, is the sum of money the law imposes for a breach of some duty or violation of some right. Generally, there are two types of damages : compensatory and punitive. (The term "damages" typically includes both categories, but the term, ""actual damages" is synonymous with compensatory damages, and excludes punitive damages.)
Compensatory damages, like the name suggests, are intended to compensate the injured party for his loss or injury. Punitive damages are awarded to punish a wrongdoer. There are other modifying terms placed in front of the word damages like "liquidated damages," (contractually established damages) and "nominal damages" (where the court awards a nominal amount such as one dollar). For certain types of injuries statutes provide that successful parties should receive some multiple of their "actual damages" -- e.g., treble damages.
There are general principles governing what types of damages are awarded. Itt is generally recognized, for instance, that punitive damages are not available for breaches of contract except when it is proven that the breach was wanton, willful and deliberate.
PRODUCTS LIABILITY LAW
Products liability refers to the liability of any or all parties along the chain of manufacture of any product for damage caused by that product. This includes the manufacturer of component parts (at the top of the chain), an assembling manufacturer, the wholesaler, and the retail store owner (at the bottom of the chain). Products containing inherent defects that cause harm to a consumer of the product, or someone to whom the product was loaned, given, etc., are the subjects of products liability suits. While products are generally thought of as tangible personal property, products liability has stretched that definition to include intangibles (gas), naturals (pets), real estate (house), and writings (navigational charts).
Products liability claims can be based on negligence, strict liability, or breach of warranty of fitness depending on the jurisdiction within which the claim is based. Many states have enacted comprehensive products liability statutes. These statutory provisions can be very diverse such that the the United States Department of Commerce has promulgated a Model Uniform Products Liability Act (MUPLA) for voluntary use by the states. There is no federal products liability law.
In any jurisdiction one must prove that the product is defective. There are three types of product defects that incur liability in manufacturers and suppliers: design defects, manufacturing defects, and defects in marketing. Design defects are inherent; they exist before the product is manufactured. While the item might serve its purpose well, it can be unreasonably dangerous to use due to a design flaw. On the other hand, manufacturing defects occur during the construction or production of the item. Only a few out of many products of the same type are flawed in this case. Defects in marketing deal with improper instructions and failures to warn consumers of latent dangers in the product.
Products Liability is generally considered a strict liability offense. Strict liability wrongs do not depend on the degree of carefulness by the defendant. Translated to products liability terms, a defendant is liable when it is shown that the product is defective. It is irrelevant whether the manufacturer or supplier exercised great care; if there is a defect in the product that causes harm, he or she will be liable for it.
The law of products liability is found mainly in common law (state judge-made law) and in the Uniform Commercial Code. Article 2 of the UCC deals with the sales of goods and it has been adopted by most states. In it, the most important products liability sections are the implied and express warranties of merchantibility in the sales of goods Â§Â§ 2-314 and 2-315. Products liability is derived mainly from Torts law.
