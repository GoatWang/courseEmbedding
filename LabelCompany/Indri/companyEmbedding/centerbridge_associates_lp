The Blackstone Group L.P. (NYSE:BX), Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. are among potential suitors studying bids for Home Capital Group Inc.

(TSX:BAM.A) and Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited (TSX:FFH) are among other firms interested in buying Home Capital, speaking on condition of anonymity as the discussions are private.
