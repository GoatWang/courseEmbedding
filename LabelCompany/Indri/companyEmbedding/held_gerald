Federal agents have taken records from a state court in Brooklyn to determine whether a judge did illegal favors for lawyers and litigants, Federal and state officials said yesterday.They identified the judge as Justice Gerald S. Held, who sits in the civil division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to describe the nature of the possible favors or what the judge's motivation might have been.Justice Held did not return a call to his chambers yesterday, but his lawyer, Harvey L. Greenberg, said: ''The judge has heard about the investigation. He has nothing to hide and nothing to fear.'' Mr. Greenberg, a former chief assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, said, ''There's nobody as straight in the courthouse as he is.''The officials who spoke about the inquiry said they did not know which lawyers were involved in the civil lawsuits that Federal investigators are looking at, or the nature of the suits. But it would be likely for the lawyers involved in the cases being reviewed to be subjects of the investigation as well.

Civil litigation in State Supreme Court generally includes matters like contract disputes and personal-injury suits: cases involving automobile accidents, medical malpractice, so-called slip-and-fall claims and the like. Continue reading the main story

The officials said that as far as they knew, Justice Held was the only judge in the court whose actions were being studied.

A spokesman for the New York State Office of Court Administration, David Bookstaver, said: ''It has come to our attention that there is some type of Federal investigation taking place. However, as to the nature and scope of the investigation, we are not aware.'' He referred questions to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.A spokesman for the bureau, James Margolin, declined to comment, as did William Muller, executive assistant to the United States attorney in Brooklyn, whose office is supervising the inquiry.Justice Held, who has been on the State Supreme Court bench since 1974 and whose term ends in 2002, now handles civil trials. In the past, he has been a trial assignment judge, whose role is to assign cases to other judges for trial once the pretrial proceedings are completed.This has led to a belief among some lawyers who practice in the court that the investigators are seeking to determine whether the possible favors included ''steering'' cases to judges desired by one side in the litigation.

Gerald R. Ford





	When Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974 as our 38th President, he declared, "I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances...This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts." 




	When Gerald R. Ford took the oath of office on August 9, 1974, he declared, "I assume the Presidency under extraordinary circumstances.... This is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts."

	It was indeed an unprecedented time. He had been the first Vice President chosen under the terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment and, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, was succeeding the first President ever to resign.

	Ford was confronted with almost insuperable tasks. There were the challenges of mastering inflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic energy shortages, and trying to ensure world peace.

	The President acted to curb the trend toward Government intervention and spending as a means of solving the problems of American society and the economy. In the long run, he believed, this shift would bring a better life for all Americans.

	Ford's reputation for integrity and openness had made him popular during his 25 years in Congress. From 1965 to 1973, he was House Minority Leader. Born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1913, he grew up in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He starred on the University of Michigan football team, then went to Yale, where he served as assistant coach while earning his law degree. During World War II he attained the rank of lieutenant commander in the Navy. After the war he returned to Grand Rapids, where he began the practice of law, and entered Republican politics. A few weeks before his election to Congress in 1948, he married Elizabeth Bloomer. They have four children: Michael, John, Steven, and Susan.

	As President, Ford tried to calm earlier controversies by granting former President Nixon a full pardon. His nominee for Vice President, former Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York, was the second person to fill that office by appointment. Gradually, Ford selected a cabinet of his own.

	Ford established his policies during his first year in office, despite opposition from a heavily Democratic Congress. His first goal was to curb inflation. Then, when recession became the Nation's most serious domestic problem, he shifted to measures aimed at stimulating the economy. But, still fearing inflation, Ford vetoed a number of non-military appropriations bills that would have further increased the already heavy budgetary deficit. During his first 14 months as President he vetoed 39 measures. His vetoes were usually sustained.

	Ford continued as he had in his Congressional days to view himself as "a moderate in domestic affairs, a conservative in fiscal affairs, and a dyed-in-the-wool internationalist in foreign affairs." A major goal was to help business operate more freely by reducing taxes upon it and easing the controls exercised by regulatory agencies. "We...declared our independence 200 years ago, and we are not about to lose it now to paper shufflers and computers," he said.

	In foreign affairs Ford acted vigorously to maintain U. S. power and prestige after the collapse of Cambodia and South Viet Nam. Preventing a new war in the Middle East remained a major objective; by providing aid to both Israel and Egypt, the Ford Administration helped persuade the two countries to accept an interim truce agreement. Detente with the Soviet Union continued. President Ford and Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev set new limitations upon nuclear weapons.

	President Ford won the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 1976, but lost the election to his Democratic opponent, former Governor Jimmy Carter of Georgia.

	On Inauguration Day, President Carter began his speech: "For myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land." A grateful people concurred.

 48832 - USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78)
The USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) is the lead ship of a new class of U.S. Navy supercarriers and is well equipped to bring a swift and decisive measure of force to any scenario.
Named after Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr., the former President of the United States, the ship and her crew uphold the same honor and integrity that was a hallmark of President Ford’s life. After serving as a naval officer in World War II, attaining the rank of Lieutenant Commander, Ford was elected to the United States Congress in 1949 and held his seat for 25 years. Ford’s tenure was marked by his modesty and integrity in legislative negotiations. In 1973, when President Richard Nixon had to choose a replacement for Vice President Spiro Agnew, the overwhelming consensus on the hill was that Ford was the man for the job. After President Nixon resigned, President Gerald Ford took the oath of office and became the 38th President of the United States.
The USS Gerald R. Ford has a displacement of approximately 110,000 tons and carries a complement of over 4,660 personnel. Stretching over 1,106 feet in length and with a 256 foot beam, it is one of the largest carriers ever made. The USS Gerald R. Ford, equipped with a modern defense system and carrying more than 75 aircraft, is well prepared for any mission across the globe.
Minted in the USA from solid bronze, using special deep-relief coining dies, and hand finished with an antique patina for exceptional quality and detail, this coin pays tribute to the USS Gerald R. Ford and her crew. The obverse features a frontal view of the supercarrier with a portrait of Gerald Ford looking on and two F-18 Super Hornets flying overhead. The reverse displays the seals of the President of the United States, the Vice President of the United States, and the U.S. House of Representatives.

	The  new 147,000-square-foot Seng-Liang Wang Hall, located just north of the Northwestern Avenue Parking Garage, provides laboratories, offices, conference rooms, and support facilities for the College of Engineering. The  School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the primary tenant, occupies 40 percent of the innovative, multipurpose building.

	To help provide new facilities for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Patrick Wang, (BSEE ’72, MSEE, ’72, HDR ’04) and his wife, Lucy, both of Hong Kong, contributed the lead gift to the building, naming it in honor of Patrick’s late father. “My father did not have the opportunity to finish high school, let alone college, but he toiled tirelessly so I and other members of my family could go to college in America,” said Patrick. What Seng-Liang may have lacked in formal education, he made up for in ingenuity, character, dedication, entrepreneurship, and a strong belief in the value of education. In 1959, he founded Johnson Electric in Hong Kong, which today is a growing multinational company for which Patrick now serves as chairman and chief executive officer.

	Under Patrick’s leadership, Johnson Electric has evolved from a $2 million company best known for producing motors for high-end model racing cars, to a leader in motion subsystems, serving many industries including automotive, building automation, business machines, home technologies, health care, and power tools. 

	Patrick said he hopes that the building will afford students opportunities to flourish in ways that will contribute to a brighter future. “I was fortunate to be born to parents who were entrepreneurs. Their unwavering belief in me, and their mentorship, imbued in me a ‘can do’ attitude and a resilience to setbacks,” he said. “It is my wish that this building will be the place to nurture talents for professional excellence as well as entrepreneurship — so these things can make our world a better place for future generations.”

2016 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


I am delighted to recognize the 2016 Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineers as we celebrate not only the successes of our OECEs, but the successes of our on-campus ECE family as well. Our OECE honorees join a distinguished group of alumni who have previously received this honor, engineers who represent the finest in their fields, and who embody the spirit of Purdue Engineering, applying a world view to work that has a universal impact.
            


We are proud to count each of our honorees among the Purdue ECE family of extraordinary people who are making a global impact. Please join me in congratulating our ECE honorees and our 2016 OECE honorees as they receive the School of Electrical and Computer Engineeringâs top accolade for professional achievement.
 
- Leah Jamieson, John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering (OECE) awards celebration â recognizing the achievements of alumni and faculty â is a highlight event each year. This year marks the first time in our 128-year-old history when our faculty size exceeds the 100 mark. And many of our performance metrics are at record or near-record levels. As we near the end of the planned engineering expansion, we are well-positioned to achieve even greater levels of excellence.


This evening I am pleased to congratulate a special group - the newest class of Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering alumni. We are proud of their achievements and Iâm honored to welcome them to an elite group. Their accomplishments along with those of our faculty serve as an inspiration to all of us, and especially to our students as they set out to make a difference in the world. 
- V. "Ragu" Balakrishnan, Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

1997 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


In an era when electrical and computer engineering has an 
ever-increasing impact on daily life, it is especially appropriate 
to recognize the contributions made by our alumni to the profession 
we share. As we work on a personal computer or make a 911 call, use 
the Internet or a power tool, we are using techniques and devices 
developed by our 1997 Outstanding Electrical Engineer Award recipients.

Purdue University is dedicated to education, research, and 
service. As you will learn from the short biographies, 
our outstanding engineers have reflected those same 
priorities as they shared their education and experience with 
others in this country and abroad, advanced the technologies of 
their industry, and contributed to their communities. In so doing 
they have brought honor upon themselves and, indirectly, upon the 
university where they studied. Purdue University is proud to claim 
them as alumni and honor them as Outstanding Electrical Engineers.
