                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Correction: Fitch Affirms 7 Classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3 | Business Wire


























































      Correction: Fitch Affirms 7 Classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3
    





August 15, 2016 12:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--(This is a correction to a release published July 15, 2016. It includes 
      Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds 
      - Effective from 14 May 2014 to 18 July 2016', which was omitted from 
      the original release.)
    

      As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed seven 
      classes of outstanding notes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3. A full 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and 
      loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within 
      Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit 
      enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios 
      consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to 
      investors, in accordance with the terms of the documents.
    

      The ratings reflect the quality of CarMax Business Services, LLC's 
      retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing 
      capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the 
      transactions.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for 
      the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base 
      case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable 
      performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising 
      loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material deterioration 
      in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have 
      potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed for this rating 
      action.
    

      Fitch issues the following rating actions:
    

      CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3
    

      --Class A-2a: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-2b: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B: at 'AAsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;
    

      --Class C: at 'Asf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;
    

      --Class D: at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.

      Fitch Rates CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3
    





August 12, 2015 04:50 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3 (CAOT 2015-3) listed 
      below:
    

      --$152,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$193,000,000 class A-2A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$175,000,000 class A-2B 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$300,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$115,500,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$18,500,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,000,000 class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$26,000,000 class D 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Consistent Credit Quality: 2015-3 is in line with the prior five 
      transactions from a collateral credit quality perspective. The weighted 
      average (WA) FICO is 700. However, there is a slight increase in greater 
      than 60 month loans at 58.8%.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: Initial CE for the class A 
      notes has dropped slightly since 2015-2, while CE on the class B, C, and 
      D notes has increased. Initial excess spread is 4.48%, lower than 2015-2 
      as well. Loss coverage for all notes is adequate to support Fitch's 
      2.40% base case proxy for the respective ratings.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on CAF's portfolio 
      and 2010-2014 securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen 
      in 2008.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market (WVM) is 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      increasing used vehicle supply from off-lease vehicles and trade-ins to 
      pressure ABS recovery rates, leading to moderately higher loss rates. 
      Fitch's analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak WVM 
      performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectation.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: Fitch believes CAF to be 
      a capable originator, underwriter and servicer for CAOT 2015-3.
    

      Integrity of the Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of CAF would not impair the timeliness 
      of the payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. In turn, it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on 
      the notes. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      all classes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes 
      display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses. In fact, they 
      could lead to potential downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's 
      moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The notes could experience 
      downgrades of two to three rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from KPMG LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 125 loans 
      from the statistical data file. Fitch considered this information in its 
      analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3 - Appendix'. 
      These R&Ws are compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as 
      detailed in the special report 'Representations, Warranties, and 
      Enforcement Mechanisms in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated 
      June 2015.

Certain Derivatives Instruments (Financial Information).Based on the standards set forth in Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB, no information is required in response to this item.Item 1117 of Regulation AB.  Legal Proceedings.There are no legal proceedings pending, or any proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against CarMax Business Services, LLC (the “Sponsor” and, in its role as the servicer, the “Servicer”), CarMax Auto Funding LLC (the “Depositor”), U.S. Bank Trust National Association (the “Owner Trustee”), the Issuing Entity or the other parties described in Item 1117 of Regulation AB, or of which any property of the foregoing is the subject, that are material to holders of the Notes.Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Indenture Trustee”) has provided the following information for inclusion in this report:On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”). In December 2014, the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon, and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order (“Jan. 19 Order”) was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed the plaintiffs to file amended complaints, and three amended complaints have been filed. On March 28, 2016, certain plaintiffs filed a new complaint in state court in San Francisco, California, with regard to the trusts that had been dismissed in the Jan. 19 Order.There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.PART IIThe following items have been omitted in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:Item 5.Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.Item 6.Selected Financial Data.Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.Item 9A.Controls and ProceduresItem 9B.     Other Information.None.PART IIIThe following items have been omitted in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K:Item 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.Item 11.Executive Compensation.Item 12.Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.Item 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.Item 14.Principal Accountant Fees and Services.Substitute information provided in accordance with General Instruction J to Form 10-K: Item 1119 of Regulation AB.  Affiliations  and Certain Relationships and Related Transactions.Information required by Item 1119 of Regulation AB has been omitted from this report on Form 10-K in reliance on the Instruction to Item 1119.Item 1122 of Regulation AB.

Each of the Servicing Parties has completed a report on an assessment of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it (each, a "Servicing Report"), which Servicing Reports are attached as exhibits to this report on Form 10-K.  In addition, each of the Servicing Parties has provided an attestation report under Item 1122 of Regulation AB (each, an "Attestation Report") by an independent  registered public accounting firm, which reports are also attached as exhibits to this report on Form 10-K.  Neither of the Servicing Reports provided by the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee nor the Attestation Reports provided by the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee has identified any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing criteria applicable to the respective Servicing Party.Item 1123 of Regulation AB.  Servicer Compliance Statement.The Servicer has been identified by the registrant as a servicer with respect to the asset pool held by the Issuing Entity.   The Servicer has completed a statement of compliance (a "Compliance Statement") signed by an authorized officer of the Servicer.

It includes Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds - Effective from 14 May 2014 to 18 July 2016', which was omitted from the original release.)As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed seven classes of outstanding notes of CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe rating affirmations are based on available credit enhancement and loss performance. The collateral pool continues to perform within Fitch's expectations. Based on the current structure and credit enhancement, the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors, in accordance with the terms of the documents.The ratings reflect the quality of CarMax Business Services, LLC's retail auto loan originations, the strength of its servicing capabilities, and the sound financial and legal structure of the transactions.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy, and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transaction. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a 1.5x and 2.5x increase of Fitch's base case loss expectation. To date, the transaction has exhibited stable performance with losses within Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels. Therefore, a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratingsDUE DILIGENCE USAGENo third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed for this rating action.Fitch issues the following rating actions:CarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3--Class A-2a: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-2b: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-3: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class A-4: at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Class B: at 'AAsf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;--Class C: at 'Asf'; Outlook to Positive from Stable;--Class D: at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds - Effective from 14 May 2014 to 18 July 2016 (pub. 14 May 2014)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=744158Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=879815Criteria for Servicing Continuity Risk in Structured Finance (pub. 17 Dec 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=875586Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=878723Related ResearchCarMax Auto Owner Trust 2015-3 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=869235Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1010391Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1010391Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
