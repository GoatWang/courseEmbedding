  About Us
  











 
About Us

We are a holding company that operates dynamic, primarily growth-oriented, businesses. The companies we own, in whole or in part, are at various stages of development, ranging from established, cash generating businesses to early stage development companies.


Our primary businesses are IC Power, a wholly-owned power generation company that has experienced profitable growth in its revenues and generation capacity since its inception in 2007, and Qoros, a China-based automotive company in which we have a 50% equity interest, that is seeking to deliver international standards of quality, safety, and innovative features to the large and fast-growing Chinese market and, which has recently commenced commercial sales.
Our non-primary interests include: (i) a 32% stake in ZIM, a global container shipping company, and (ii) two businesses in the renewable energy sector, including Primus an innovative developer of an alternative fuel technology.
We intend to assist with the growth and development of these businesses, with the goal of maximizing their value, improving the market’s understanding of these businesses, and exposing these businesses to a pool of international investors, based on each business’ industry and development stage.
Additionally, as we continue to grow and develop our primary businesses, we intend to provide our shareholders with direct access to these businesses when we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders based on company-specific factors, market conditions and other relevant information.
As we execute our strategy, we will operate under disciplined capital allocation principles designed to promote the growth and development of our primary businesses, maximize value for our shareholders and ensure the prudent use of our capital. For example, we will refrain from investing in any new ventures outside of our existing businesses, we do not intend to materially “cross-allocate” proceeds received in connection with distributions from, or sales of our interests in, any of our businesses, among our businesses, and we intend to return such proceeds to our shareholders or make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
