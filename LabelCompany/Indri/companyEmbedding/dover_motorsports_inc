Dover International Speedway – It's All Here



How did 750 acres in Kent County, Delaware, become a go-to destination for national and international motorsports and music fans?

Combine a high-banked, one-mile concrete oval, six NASCAR races, the East Coast’s leading music festival, a neighboring hotel and casino, as well as easy access for millions of people along the East Coast, and you have a formula for one of the most attractive sports and entertainment destinations in the mid-Atlantic region.
  
Built by Dover Motorsports, Inc. (NYSE: DVD), Dover International Speedway has been hosting NASCAR events since the green flag dropped on the “Mason-Dixon 300” on July 6, 1969.

That day’s race winner, Richard Petty, has called the first Dover race NASCAR’s “invasion of the North.” Since that time, not only has the NASCAR Cup Series remained, but others have followed, looking to conquer the track known throughout motorsports as “The Monster Mile.”

In 2017, Dover International Speedway is again set to host two NASCAR tripleheader weekends, on June 2-4 and Sept. 29-Oct. 1.

On Friday, June 2, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series returns to Dover, followed by the NASCAR XFINITY Series race on Saturday, June 3 and the “AAA 400 Drive for Autism” NASCAR Cup Series race on Sunday, June 4. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series has made an annual stop at Dover International Speedway since 2000, while the NASCAR XFINITY Series has been coming to the Monster Mile since 1982. 

In the fall, NASCAR K&N Pro Series East drivers hit Dover on Friday, Sept. 29. The NASCAR K&N Pro Series East first raced at the Monster Mile in 1998, and became an annual Dover feature in 2001.

The next day, Saturday, Sept. 30, the “Drive Sober 200” presented by the Delaware Office of Highway Safety NASCAR XFINITY Series race returns, followed by the centerpiece of the weekend, the NASCAR Cup Series race on Sunday, Oct. 2. For the fourth consecutive year, Dover International Speedway will host the first elimination race in the Chase for the NASCAR Cup Series championship postseason, where four of the 16 playoff-eligible drivers will be knocked out of title contention. For four of the sport’s top drivers, it’s over in Dover.

When drivers strap in their vehicles at the Monster Mile, they compete on one of the sport’s unique venues. With speeds exceeding 160 mph, drivers face 24 degrees of banking in all four turns, as well as 9 degrees of incline on the straightaways, leading to Dover International Speedway’s reputation as the world’s fastest one-mile concrete oval.

The excitement continues outside the track, as Dover International Speedway shares the property with full-service Dover Downs Hotel & Casino, giving race fans the complete vacation destination. Behind the frontstretch stands the 46-foot-tall Monster Monument, a fiberglass structure that attracts visitors to the track year-round. The structure is within Victory Plaza, which also hosts free, pre-race concerts for fans, which in recent years have included acts such as Jerrod Niemann, Cassadee Pope, Colt Ford, the X Ambassadors, Jana Kramer and Easton Corbin.

More musical acts visit The Woodlands at Dover International Speedway between the two 2017 NASCAR weekends as the Firefly Music Festival, presented by Red Frog Events and Goldenvoice, takes the stage on June 15-18.

The Firefly Music Festival was first held in July 2012 and hosted 48 national music acts over three days. In just five years, Firefly has grown to a four-day event that hosts upwards of 90,000 fans per day, with more than 100 acts playing across seven stages, earning a top-five U.S. music festival designation by Rolling Stone magazine.

Notable acts that have appeared at Firefly include Paul McCartney, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Outkast, The Black Keys, The Killers, Jack White, Kings of Leon and Mumford & Sons. Other aspects of Firefly include a retro video game arcade, hammock hangouts, a silent disco, a marketplace and much more.

From music to motorsports, it’s all here at Dover International Speedway.

Dover Motorsports, Inc. (formerly Dover Downs Entertainment) is a company that owned several auto racing circuits in the United States. The company is based in Dover, Delaware, United States, the home of its flagship track Dover International Speedway, a 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete oval with a seating capacity of 95,500 that opened in 1969. The company formerly owned the Dover Downs harness racing track adjacent to the Dover speedway. Dover Motorsports formerly operated Nashville Superspeedway, a 1.333 mile concrete oval track in Lebanon, Tennessee, and Gateway International Raceway, a 1.25 mile egg-shaped asphalt oval track in Madison, Illinois, in addition to its flagship one-mile concrete oval track. Dover Motorsports owned Memphis Motorsports Park, a .75 mile tri-oval asphalt short track in Millington, Tennessee, but closed the track in October 2009 to competition and was sold to Palm Beach International Raceway after sitting unused for over a year.
In 2011, Dover Motorsports announced that it will not sanction NASCAR events at Gateway International Raceway, and Nashville Superspeedway will also no longer host NASCAR races starting in 2012.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.

Dover Motorsports, Inc. (formerly Dover Downs Entertainment) is a company that owned several auto racing circuits in the United States. The company is based in Dover, Delaware, United States, the home of its flagship track Dover International Speedway, a 1 mile (1.6 km) concrete oval with a seating capacity of 95,500 that opened in 1969. The company formerly owned the Dover Downs harness racing track adjacent to the Dover speedway. Dover Motorsports formerly operated Nashville Superspeedway, a 1.333 mile concrete oval track in Lebanon, Tennessee, and Gateway International Raceway, a 1.25 mile egg-shaped asphalt oval track in Madison, Illinois, in addition to its flagship one-mile concrete oval track. Dover Motorsports owned Memphis Motorsports Park, a .75 mile tri-oval asphalt short track in Millington, Tennessee, but closed the track in October 2009 to competition and was sold to Palm Beach International Raceway after sitting unused for over a year.
In 2011, Dover Motorsports announced that it will not sanction NASCAR events at Gateway International Raceway, and Nashville Superspeedway will also no longer host NASCAR races starting in 2012.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
