Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]
Over the course of his career, Iger has been recognized by several major media publications for his leadership at Disney, having been named one of Fortune Magazine's "25 Most Powerful People in Business" (2006, 2007), a "Top Gun CEO" by Forbes (2009), a "Best CEO" by Institutional Investor Magazine (2008-2011), "CEO of the Year" by MarketWatch (2006), and "CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive Magazine (2014).[2] Iger has also been inducted as a member of several organizations, including the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Toy Industry Hall of Fame.[2][14][15][16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]
Over the course of his career, Iger has been recognized by several major media publications for his leadership at Disney, having been named one of Fortune Magazine's "25 Most Powerful People in Business" (2006, 2007), a "Top Gun CEO" by Forbes (2009), a "Best CEO" by Institutional Investor Magazine (2008-2011), "CEO of the Year" by MarketWatch (2006), and "CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive Magazine (2014).[2] Iger has also been inducted as a member of several organizations, including the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Toy Industry Hall of Fame.[2][14][15][16]

On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

How Robert Iger's 'fearless' deal-making transformed Disney

Disney's Robert Iger: "I just was built with an innate ability to not let fear guide me in how I run my life"




On his second day on the job as chief executive, Robert Iger steeled himself for a crucial presentation to the Walt Disney Co. board of directors.Disney was still smarting from a hostile takeover attempt, a shareholder revolt and executive suite intrigue spawned in the sunset of the Michael Eisner regime.But there was a more urgent problem: The once-proud animation unit was in a rut."If I didn't turn Disney Animation around quickly … there was a drumbeat that was going to get louder and louder in terms of whether I was worthy of the job and how long I would last and all those things," Iger recalled confiding to his wife, journalist Willow Bay. "So I knew that the pressure was on."

At the Oct. 2, 2005, board meeting, Iger floated an idea that would become a hallmark of his tenure. He made a risky, even audacious, proposal: What if the company bought Pixar Animation Studios?














The computer animation upstart owned by Apple's Steve Jobs was at odds with Disney over the terms of extending the two companies' partnership. Iger worried about the directors' reaction to pursuing a high-stakes acquisition so soon after taking over."To the credit of the board, they did not throw me out of the room," he said.ALSO: Robert Iger on Disney's strategy, past struggles and more

In a recent interview, Walt Disney Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Iger discussed how his company’s purchases of Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm have transformed the Burbank entertainment giant. 

On Disney Animation's struggles: 

"When I became CEO, we had been... (Daniel Miller)

Three months later, Disney said it would buy Pixar for $7.4 billion. It was the first of three major purchases engineered by Iger, laying the foundation for the subsequent acquisitions of Marvel Entertainment in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012.Fast forward to 2015, which marks the first time that each of the acquired companies is releasing a film in the same year, underscoring the central role they now play in the Disney empire.But the acquisitions didn't always look like sure things."These deals were questioned by analysts on Wall Street, including me," said Tuna Amobi, an analyst for S&P Capital IQ. "But with the investors I speak to, the perception is that the deals could be the best deals in the media space of all time, pound for pound."The acquisitions are a big reason Disney's stock price has more than quadrupled during Iger's tenure. Beyond that, they kept Disney from a fate that has befallen many a corporate giant that tried to live off its past success. Sears Roebuck & Co., U.S. Steel, Eastman Kodak, Pan Am — the annals of American business are filled with companies that either failed or fell from their peaks because they didn't adapt to competition and changing technology.In the rare case of a company getting back on top, it is usually rejuvenated by an outsider — like Louis Gerstner Jr., who revived a battered IBM in the 1990s — rather than an insider like Iger, who had been at Disney for nearly a decade before becoming chief executive.Like many successful corporate leaders, Iger, 64, decided early on to try to control events rather than react to them. To be "fearless," as he put it in a recent interview."I just was built with an innate ability to not let fear guide me in how I run my life," he said. "You can look at all the numbers in the world, but at some point somebody … needs to dig down deep, search his soul, analyze or get in touch with his own or her own instinct, and decide."Former colleagues say Iger possesses an expansive vision for Disney and is daring enough to act on it. He solicits opinions, notes former Disneyland International Chairman Jim Cora, but ultimately goes "where his gut tells him to go."FACT FILE: Robert Iger's bio, favorite Disneyland ride and moreIger has not been infallible. Disney's live-action studio business has had its share of misses, including the disastrous "Lone Ranger" in 2013 and its current disappointment, "Tomorrowland."It also remains to be seen how Iger's $500-million gamble last year to buy Maker Studios, which produces low-cost videos for YouTube, will pay off.Still, if Iger were to step aside tomorrow, he would have left Disney in far better shape than when he became chief executive. Iger is expected to retire in 2018, when his contract expires, and this year Thomas Staggs was named Disney's chief operating officer, making him the top internal candidate to become the next CEO.Whoever it is, Disney's next chief executive can be expected to face an entirely new set of challenges. But it's also likely that its next leader will be studying the Iger playbook.Aiming for PixarEmerging from the Oct. 2 board meeting, Iger began mapping out a possible purchase of Pixar. The next day, he directed a small group of trusted advisors, Staggs among them, to do more homework. And he told them he planned to call Jobs.The team wasn't sold on the idea, but Iger made the call anyway, reaching Jobs that afternoon as he drove home from Disney headquarters in Burbank."I said, 'Steve, I've got a crazy idea,'" Iger recalled.Iger told Jobs that he wanted to visit him to make a proposal. But Jobs insisted on knowing what was on Iger's mind right away."I hesitated. I was kind of nervous, because the last thing I wanted was for him to basically hang up on me," Iger said. At first, he struggled with how to articulate his pitch."I figured I might as well just cut to the chase and I said, 'You know — Disney acquiring Pixar?' And there was complete silence," Iger said. "My heart was racing. And he said, 'You know what? It's not the craziest idea in the world.'"Iger said the importance of Pixar to Disney's future had become clear to him during opening ceremonies for Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005, just a month before he became chief executive. He noticed the many characters from Pixar films featured in the kickoff parade. But there was nothing from Disney's recent animated movies, whose latest characters weren't popular."It was a light bulb at a very high wattage," Iger recalled.The phone conversation with Jobs eventually led to Disney's purchase of Pixar at a 3.8% premium to its stock price. The deal, which made the mercurial Jobs Disney's biggest shareholder, was widely questioned by analysts who believed the price was too dear.

But the acquisition arguably saved Disney Animation from a long decline that had been punctuated by flops such as 2002's "Treasure Planet." The animation unit's box-office prospects were quickly lifted and Disney also netted Pixar's leaders, John Lasseter and Ed Catmull.In an effort to convince the animation gurus that they could thrive at Disney, Iger shared with them his own experience of working for a company that was acquired.In 1996, Disney bought Capital Cities and its ABC TV network for $19 billion. Iger was president of the company, having risen through the executive ranks for two decades. Such acquisitions often lead to executive departures. But then-Disney Chairman Eisner retained Iger, who was promoted to president and chief operating officer of Disney in 2000."I was a living, breathing example of how someone could not only survive an acquisition but thrive," he said.And in the same way that he was given an opportunity at Disney, Iger gave Lasseter and Catmull a big one too, putting them in charge of Disney Animation. The division has since released hits including "Frozen," the top-grossing animated film of all time.Buying Pixar, Iger said, "was the single most important thing that has happened to me in the 10 years I've been in this job."A film giantBy most accounts, Disney is king of the hill in Hollywood. The world's largest entertainment firm, it owns television networks, a film studio and growing theme park and consumer products businesses — all of which work together to get maximum mileage out of the company's stable of intellectual property.Although the financial performance of each Disney division has improved under Iger, he has arguably made his biggest impact in film. In 2005, Disney was fifth among the six major studios in domestic box-office receipts, according to Rentrak. Now it's near the top: In 2014, Disney was No. 2 behind 20th Century Fox. So far this year, Disney again is in second place, trailing Warner Bros. by a narrow margin despite having released fewer films.The difference? The Pixar and Marvel acquisitions, which have turbocharged Walt Disney Studios, providing the division with a slew of blockbuster franchises, including "Cars" and "Iron Man."Those films are exceedingly valuable to Disney because they've become a centerpiece of the company's strategy of integrating intellectual property throughout its five business units.In Disney's hands, a movie like "Frozen," which was released in November 2013, can spin off cash years after it exits theaters. The film's merchandise sales, for example, were credited with helping boost the consumer products division's operating income 32% in the quarter that ended March 28."Disney monetizes its content better than anyone else out there," said Scott Krisiloff, chief investment officer at Avondale Asset Management. "They don't just sell you the movie ticket, they sell you the figurine, the theme park ticket, they sell you on the experience."Disney generated $7.5 billion in profit last year, dwarfing the earnings of rivals such as Time Warner, Viacom and 21st Century Fox. (Comcast posted a bigger profit than Disney in fiscal 2014, but the bulk of that company's net income comes from its telecommunications business.)Iger has reaped his rewards for Disney's success. He was paid $46.5 million last year, and he holds about 1.14 million shares of Disney stock, according to recent regulatory filings. His stock holdings were worth more than $125 million as of Friday.But not everything Iger has touched has turned to gold. In 2009, he put TV veteran Rich Ross in charge of the film studio. Three years later, Disney parted ways with Ross after the release of "John Carter," the poorly received sci-fi epic that resulted in a $200-million write-down. Ross had also put "Lone Ranger" into production.But after Ross' exit, Iger moved swiftly to correct course. He brought in a veteran studio hand, former Warner Bros. President Alan Horn.That willingness to make a decisive move is also evident in Iger's approach to deal-making. Iger said that when he's considering an acquisition, he doesn't get caught up in what-ifs."It's not that I'm a daredevil," Iger said. "But I'm just generally not a fearful person. I don't conduct my life worrying about what could happen, what may happen."Pivotal purchasesThe Pixar deal may be the one that established Iger's acquisition bona fides, but Disney wouldn't be where it is today without the Marvel and Lucasfilm purchases.Marvel had long been a gleam in Disney's eye. The company had a stable of popular comic book characters such as Iron Man, Spider-Man and Wolverine and by the mid-2000s had found success releasing superhero movies with rival film studios.To get Marvel, Disney would have to convince owner Isaac Perlmutter, a sharp-elbowed Israeli- American businessman, that it was time to sell."Ike was difficult to reach, didn't engage very much and never came to Hollywood," Iger said.Iger eventually got on Perlmutter's schedule: They would meet in June 2009 at the inscrutable Marvel executive's offices in Manhattan.Iger walked into Perlmutter's office by himself and told the story of buying Pixar, hammering on the opportunities it created. Iger also suggested that Perlmutter telephone Jobs, who could share his experience of selling Pixar to Disney."I basically tried to convince him that I was a trustworthy guy — not only was my handshake good but I'd be a good steward of his people and the brand," Iger said.He said that the $4-billion deal was effectively clinched over dinner with their wives at an Upper East Side steakhouse.Under Disney, Marvel has released three films that have topped $1 billion at the box office: "The Avengers," "Iron Man 3" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron.""Star Wars" is next.As with the Marvel deal, Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm — the producer of the sci-fi franchise — hinged on a pivotal meal.

Iger and Lucasfilm owner George Lucas met for breakfast at Walt Disney World's Hollywood Brown Derby (patterned after the long-gone L.A. eateries) in 2011 while both were in Florida to unveil a new 3-D Star Tours attraction.Iger's pitch invoked the successes of Marvel and Pixar and drew a tantalizing response from Lucas. "What he said to me was, 'If there is anyone I want to sell to, it is you,'" Iger recalled.Six months later, Lucas rang him. "Remember that breakfast?" Iger recalled Lucas saying.The $4.06-billion deal was announced in October 2012. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" will be released Dec. 18, the first of several new films planned for the franchise.Producer Brian Grazer, who has known Iger for more than 25 years, believes that the executive's toughness — "he's kind of black ops" — has made him impervious to pressure. But it is Iger's ability to connect personally with leaders like Lucas that may be his secret weapon, Grazer said."All of these guys — beginning with Steve Jobs, then Ike Perlmutter and George Lucas — are the most discriminating founders. When you are a founder, you really look for vision and trust. I think Bob has that in the highest order," Grazer said. "That immediately gave him a competitive edge."Digital futureLast week, Disney gathered reporters to show off a new line of toys, called Playmation, aimed squarely at a demographic the company calls the "digital generation." Iger didn't preside over the reveal — those duties fell to Staggs, marking the first time he's been given such responsibilities in his role as the company's No. 2.Dressed in a trim gray suit, Staggs explained how Playmation would showcase Disney film franchises, starting with "Avengers.""Since its inception, the Walt Disney Co. has been about imagination, innovation and storytelling," he said.But now more than ever, digital innovation will be important to Disney's future. It's almost certain that the big challenge for the next CEO of Disney won't be animation or live-action film, as it was with Iger, but with the digital revolution.On this front, established media conglomerates like Disney are fighting hard to establish beachheads in areas where upstarts such as Netflix and Amazon have found quick success. It's a sea change that affects many areas of the company, but especially television, Disney's most lucrative business.It also remains to be seen what will come of Disney's purchase of Maker, a major digital bet that could end up costing Disney as much as $950 million if the company meets certain goals.The presumption of many is that these will be battles for Staggs, now seen as the internal front-runner for the CEO job. But his ascension is not preordained: Between now and 2018, his leadership will be scrutinized by Disney's board, which will select the company's next leader. The company could also eye an outsider for the job.Staggs seems to be cut from the same cloth as Iger. Both are fitness buffs, both are experienced in acquisitions (Staggs was involved in the Capital Cities/ABC deal) and are said by former colleagues such as Cora to have a similar management style."He listens to people, he trusts those who work for him or those in other divisions of the company," Cora, the former Disneyland International chairman, said of Staggs. "He gathers opinions too."Similar or not, Iger, who was made Disney's chairman in 2012, has set the bar high, and his successor will have to contend with outsized expectations. Disney's successes have been so grand and so regular — it has delivered record net income, earnings per share and revenue four fiscal years in a row — that Wall Street has become accustomed to home runs.That's a heavy burden for any CEO.Iger, in talking about the risk of acquisitions, noted that the chief executive is always the one in the spotlight."Yes, you're putting risk on a company," he said. "But from a reputational perspective, no one is taking on more risk than the CEO. And it's a risk that is personal and firmly tethered to a CEO."daniel.miller@latimes.comTwitter: @danielnmiller

Robert A. Iger Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 

Robert A. Iger is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company. As Chairman and CEO, Mr. Iger is the steward of one of the world’s largest media companies and some of the most respected and beloved brands around the globe. His strategic vision for The Walt Disney Company focuses on three fundamental pillars: generating the best creative content possible; fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology; and expanding into new markets around the world.
Mr. Iger has built on Disney’s rich history of unforgettable storytelling with the acquisition of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), and Lucasfilm (2012), and the landmark opening of Disney’s first theme park and resort in Mainland China, Shanghai Disney Resort.

Disney’s exceptional entertainment experiences, widely diverse content, and unique skill in managing businesses in an integrated manner have led to strong results.

Disney isn’t ready to completely reinvent the way it gets its movies and TV shows in front of audiences or merchandise in the hands of consumers. But Walt Disney Co. chief Bob Iger has a few ideas in mind that could impact the company’s bottom line in the not-too-distant future.
“What’s next for Disney are much more direct-to-consumer product offerings,” said Iger during a discussion with Variety co-editor-in-chief Claudia Eller at the Dealmakers Breakfast on Wednesday. “The question is how fast we bring that product to market and challenge business models that are so valuable to us today.”
What Iger is considering are ways that Disney can more directly interact with its consumers.







He gave examples of how people who see Disney’s films are the customers of movie theaters, not Disney. “The theater owners own the customer, we don’t,” Iger said. Similarly, consumers who purchase Disney-branded merchandise do so at big-box retailers like Walmart and Target, not necessarily Disney stores. “They’re Walmart customers, not Disney customers,” Iger said.
But that’s not to say that Disney plans to get into the exhibition business to create a closer connection. “We’re not going to go into the business of building movie theaters,” Iger said.
But it already has launched Disney Movies Anywhere, an app through which it is selling and storing digital copies of Disney, Pixar and Marvel films. Apple’s iTunes, Google Play, and Walmart’s Vudu support the service.
At its theme parks, it’s launched My Magic Plus, a wristband-based system through which guests can store Fast Passes for attractions, and room keys when visiting Walt Disney World, but also save credit cards through which they can purchase food and merchandise.

The overall idea is to find ways to better understand who Disney’s customer is and customize experiences for them. That could include online retail destinations built around “Star Wars,” Marvel’s superheroes or Pixar’s properties that package publishing, TV shows and films and offers access to those for a fee.
As Disney focuses more attention on its brands, “There are opportunities where we can use these brands and the affinity customers have with them to sell directly to them,” Iger said. “Long term for our company, that’s what we’re concentrating on.”
Iger singled out ESPN given the popularity of the sports network and its audience’s loyalty to the brand.
He noted how HBO is launching a standalone over-the-top service to reach audiences who don’t want to pay for the cable channel through traditional methods. ESPN has its own OTT service in the works.
“We could do that in a second,” Iger said, but “in doing so, do we want to disrupt in an extreme way the multichannel subscription model that’s delivered to us so much profitability to our company for so long? I don’t think we need to hasten that. By not doing it now, we don’t lose anything. We can always do it.”
During the Q&A, Iger provided further insight into the future of Disney’s various divisions, including its studio, TV networks and theme parks. Event, held inside the Palm restaurant, at its new location in Beverly Hills, presented by Bank of America and sponsored by Delta.







That included plans to add “Star Wars” attractions at its theme parks around the world, driven by what will appear in future films, the first of which is “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” directed by J.J. Abrams.

On His Decision to Stay at Disney Through 2018:
In October, Iger extended his contract to remain chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Co. through June 30, 2018. He will appoint a chief operating officer in 2015, with the individual most likely groomed to replace Iger when he does retire.
“It’s not the easiest thing in the world to walk away from,” said Iger of Disney.
He dismissed any notions of wanting to run for public office, a longtime rumor concerning Iger’s plans after Disney.
“I don’t think that would be fun,” Iger said. “I know it wouldn’t pay as well,” he joked.
While Iger’s successor has yet to be named, Iger acknowledged that he’s working closely with Disney’s board of directors on finding his replacement and planning a smooth transition for the next Disney chief.
“There’s a time for anyone to step off the stage,” Iger said. “I will have been CEO for 13 years. That’s enough.”
On Plans for New Acquisitions after Maker Studios, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar
“I don’t rule out a possibility for another large acquisition,” Iger said, but noted that “there’s nothing imminent. We don’t have strong strategic holes or deficits. There’s no big need right now. We’re fortunate as a company that we have an unbelievably strong balance sheet. We have more than enough to do.”
Recent acquisitions like Maker Studios, Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar all fulfill a purpose at the company, Iger said. And when it comes to future deals, deals must flow through an “acquisition sieve” and provide the company with either new intellectual property that Disney can build brands around, or provide it with new forms of technology that Disney can use to distribute its content or entertain its fanbase.
The Impact Technology Has on Entertainment Conglomerates Today
“Disruption is happening,” Iger said. “There’s no question about it. We’re seeing it more on the TV side than anywhere else.”
That disruption is largely happening through technology, and the ability of consumers to access TV shows and movies on mobile platforms, smart TVs, videogame consoles and other devices, which is impacting longstanding business models and revenue streams.
“Just about anywhere you look, there’s something happening that is shaking the foundation of the business model that’s shaped the underpinning of these great businesses,” Iger said.
With that said, Iger is upbeat on the prospects of what new technologies provide companies like Disney.
“I like to look at this change as a glass half full, versus a glass half empty,” he said. “You have to have a degree of optimism. People don’t want to follow pessimists. I can’t ignore the changes going on. You have to admit the disruption taking place. Don’t be in denial about it. Don’t will it away. Embrace technology, not push it away or deny its existence. Embrace technology every step of the way, even in ways that disrupt our business.”
Disney, however, finds itself in an enviable position, given that “when you make great content, you tend to be in demand by consumers and distribution platforms all over the world,” Iger said. “If a new distribution platform emerges, the first call they make is to Disney.”
On the Increase in Entertainment Options on New Digital Platforms
“Distribution isn’t a differentiator (anymore),” Iger said. “Distribution is a commodity,” which has forced streaming services and other online platforms to get into the original content game. “Content is still king,” Iger said. “There’s just more of it.”
And that doesn’t surprise Iger. “There are many more ways you can get content distributed than ever before. That’s a good thing.”
The bad side is that “there’s more content, but not more fantastic content. The quality hasn’t expanded as much as the content has expanded. There are things to be said for things that are great.”
On the Studio’s Decision to Make Fewer Movies
Under the reign of Rich Ross, Disney’s film studio produced fewer movies, reducing the slate to around 13 a year over the last three years. That figure will increase to 21 over the next three.
“It’s not about how much you make, it’s about how good the quality is,” Iger said. “You’ll be better off as a company making fewer things and concentrating on those and how you bring those to market … in a very less cluttered way, even though the marketplace is more cluttered.”
Why the Studio Makes Movies Like “Million Dollar Arm”
“Million Dollar Arm” may have generated praise from critics, but the $25 million film, starring Jon Hamm as a baseball scout who recruits new players in India, earned just $38 million earlier this year. That film will be followed by another feel-good sports film in “McFarland, USA,” with Kevin Costner, in February.
“You can quickly lose $10 million on a $40 million movie these days,” Iger said. “We need to be even more careful about them today than a couple years ago.”
But the point of making those non-tentpoles at the studio is to produce what it calls “brand deposits.”
“We like making these kinds of movies,” Iger said. “When people think of Disney they think of a collection of experiences. We want them to have positive thoughts about (the brand),” and profitability isn’t always necessarily the end goal.
On Whether TV Is a Good Business
Television is “not a high margin business as some of our other businesses are,” Iger said. “It’s a perfectly fine business to be in,” especially if a company can create the shows and own the network they are on. “It helps a lot.”
Overall, cable is experiencing slower growth, as new platforms compete for consumers’ time, but Iger still called it a good buy.
When it comes to branding, ABC Family is said to be rethinking its image, now that many of its series appeal to teen and tween girls, rather than the entire family.
“Over time, the programming mandate was one that was aimed at young female adults,” Iger said, with shows like “Pretty Little Liars.”
Iger said he would support any suggestion of a new way to brand the cable channel, should the right strategy be developed.
How ESPN Will Compete with New Players like Fox Sports
“Fox Sports and the other challengers right now are all competing to be a distant No. 2 because of the rights ESPN has managed to buy over the years,” Iger said, noting that ESPN has spent considerable coin to lock down broadcast rights to NFL, NCAA, MLB and NBA games. “We made a very conscious decision to do that for competitive reasons. We will buy the cream of the crop even if it costs a lot of money.”
Iger said ESPN needed to in order to continue to grow the venerable sports brand. But while it’s spent heavily on rights deals, those pacts also include the necessary digital rights to enable ESPN to go directly to its audience and make the viewing experience more flexible and compelling to consumers, Iger said.
Iger did note that the cost for sports rights is increasing due to increased competition. But “there’s a misconception that rising costs are eating into ESPN’s profits,” Iger said. “It’s not growing at the rate it used to grow, but it’s continuing to grow and will continue to grow its profitability in the next five to ten years.”
On the Move of Marketing Dollars to Digital Platforms
Iger showed some annoyance in the current state of advertising and how it’s impacting TV buy rates.
Marketers are increasingly shifting their budgets to digital platforms, considering that’s where more viewers are accessing entertainment.
“There are people in denial about this,” Iger said, and called it “ridiculous.” “Of course there’s money that’s moved over. We’ve moved it.”
The issue that needs to be solved is how to track which ads are viewed and on what digital platforms.
“There’s a strong sense (that online) is where the consumers are,” Iger said, but a solution to measure that audience needs to be more robust, he said. “There’s a lot of money being invested in solving this.”
Did Disney Kill the Merger of Hasbro and DreamWorks Animation?
Iger adamantly denied reports that Disney forced Hasbro to back away from a merger with DreamWorks Animation, given that the toymaker has licenses to produce playthings based on “Star Wars,” Marvel’s superheroes, and now “Frozen” and its popular Disney princess line, too, which previously was handled by rival Mattel.
“It’s absolutely not true,” said Iger, who also stressed that Disney is not looking to buy a toy company. “We got way too much credit.”
However, Iger simply presented Disney’s position on working with partners.
“You can be a good partner or you can be a bad partner,” Iger said, cautioning that “we fully expect that given the size of our business at Hasbro that they will behave as the licensee they were when we decided to do the deal and give more business to them.”
It was a very diplomatic way of saying a merger with DreamWorks Animation would have created a different kind of Hasbro that may not have sat well with Disney.
“If you choose to be a bad partner, there can potentially be ramifications,” Iger said. “There’s a difference in saying if you do that deal, you’re dead. We didn’t have to. Other people did it.”

What an incredible hypocrite this man is.  “Direct-yo-consumer?????”  The company had been making every effort to keep 3D Blu-Ray discs OUT of the hands of U.S. consumers.  FROZEN, MALEFICENT, NEED FOR SPEED, PLANES 2…all released to the rest of the world in 3D on disc…but banned for American consumers, forcing many to have to import titles (and risk their financial info via overseas transactions).  But hey, even THAT was too much for Disney.  So now, the 3D edition of RATATOUILLE has been region-locked so that they won’t play on most BD players.  FROZEN would have been the biggest-selling 3D title to date…but Disney kept it from us.  Is there any company LESS concerned about consumers than Disney?  Walt would be spinning if he could see how “consumer-friendly the current greed-regime is.

Maybe it’s because 3D sucks so why should Disney invest in something that is not going anywhere.

This is all about reviving a hit  franchise Film and attempting to overtake Universal Studios themed movie attractions. Kids will laugh at the dated effects and adolescent dialog. Remember “The Black Hole”, quite possibly the worst big budgeted sci fi Disney ever made. Not a good record on this genre and Star Wars revamped looks like a clone of the past films and to quote George Lucus; “Star Wars” was intended to only be seen once! Star Wars Land may not have the long term effect lets say TomorrowLand has. jv orlando

I have a cool new branding strategy for Disney Channel I would love to pitch! Although I am sure when Iger requests “any suggestion” he means “any suggestion from a Disney employee”, and not a Variety subscriber, could there possibly be an e-mail address or contact I could send my idea to?

Bob Iger Interview | 'Star Wars' Reshoots, Political Plans & More | Hollywood Reporter















































The Hollywood Reporter



























Joe Pugliese






In-Depth With Disney CEO Bob Iger on China Growth, 'Star Wars' Reshoots and Political Plans: "A Lot of People Have Urged Me to [Run]"











In an exclusive sit-down, the exec who tops the THR 100 also talks 'Indiana Jones,' ESPN and cable's future, what happened with heir apparent Tom Staggs and who will succeed him after he leaves in 2018.
Bob Iger is showing off pictures he recently took of food. "We've got a Szechuan chicken burger, a Peking duck pizza shaped in a Mickey head," he says in a demeanor one might call "CEO giddy," as animated as one of the most polished leaders in corporate America gets. "There's something called siu mai dumplings that are Shanghainese — they're tremendous!" Seated in a conference room adjacent to his office at the Walt Disney Co. headquarters in Burbank, Iger scrolls his iPad through dozens of photos shot during one of his twice-monthly visits to the new Shanghai Disney theme park. What about a churro stand? "Believe it or not, yes," he says. "I've tasted all the food at the park. Except I haven't tasted the turkey legs yet."
Iger, 65, is chatting with The Hollywood Reporter, which has named him the most powerful person in entertainment for his shrewd management of the world's largest media company. This is just a few days before he took off on his most important trip to China, to christen the $5.5 billion park with leaders of the country's communist party. Tragically, the day before the opening ceremony, Iger received news that 2-year-old Lane Graves was snatched and killed by an alligator in a lagoon at Disney's Orlando resort. The horror hit the CEO and father of four (including two sons with wife Willow Bay) especially hard — he personally called the boy's parents and dispatched his parks chief to Orlando — and illustrated the diverse challenges thrown at the New York native in his role as business executive, brand statesman and manager of the kind of bizarre news events that become amplified because of their association with Disney. "Yes, all CEOs have to deal with investors and to some extent the press, but we get a lot more attention than any other company," he says before the incident, which occurred a day after Disney donated $1 million to victims of the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando (Disney employed two of the 49 killed).
In his 11 years atop Disney, Iger has become the most effective media CEO of his generation. When he was named to the post in March 2005 (a controversial choice, given his lack of film or parks experience), the former weatherman and longtime ABC executive inherited a company whose storied animation studio was in disarray and its stock price at $27.70 a share. Thanks to a management style colleagues describe as respectful yet decisive, growth initiatives at its cable channels and a series of big-ticket deals for Pixar Animation Studios ($7.4 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4.1 billion), Disney stock closed June 20 at $99.57. The company's market cap of $163 billion helped earn Iger $46.5 million in 2015, among the top 10 paydays of U.S. CEOs. During his tenure, he has proved himself equally adept at communicating with business leaders (mending Disney's relationship with Steve Jobs, which led to the Pixar deal), the creative community and a board that includes heavyweights Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook and Twitter's Jack Dorsey. The Disney film studio has succeeded in the franchise business like none of its rivals (Finding Dory opened to $136 million during the June 17 weekend, a record for an animated film), and its Media Networks division, which includes cable TV, generated nearly $8 billion in operating income in 2015 (four times the film division and half the company's profits). Just last Sunday, Game 7 of the NBA Finals delivered more than 30 million viewers to ABC, a record for the network's basketball coverage. 




Despite all that, the challenges thrown at Iger only have increased in recent months. Lower subscriber numbers at ESPN have dragged down the company's share price lately (and the stocks of other media companies; such is the power of Disney), and a fourth-place showing at ABC this season led new TV chief Ben Sherwood to replace network president Paul Lee. Disney delivered record profits in the most recent quarter thanks to Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Zootopia, and its parks, consumer products and film units are firing on all cylinders. But ESPN was all analysts wanted to ask Iger about. "Disney needs to sustain moderate growth on its cable channels, specifically ESPN," says Steven Birenberg of Northlake Capital. "The Street is very skeptical."
The Shanghai park represents a legacy play for Iger, which made recent comments by Wang Jianlin, chairman of Dalian Wanda and China's richest man, especially irksome. "They shouldn't have entered China," said Wang, who is launching his own parks. "We have a [saying]: One tiger is no match for a pack of wolves." Disney has been attacked in the U.S. this year as well for its use of the H-1B visa program, which led to laid-off Disney employees having to train their outsourced replacements. And Iger, a Democrat and Hillary Clinton supporter whom many believe has his own political aspirations, got into a public spat with Bernie Sanders (via Facebook, of all places) over Sanders' claim that Disney underpays staff. Even outside of Disney, Iger suffered a setback in February when the NFL relocated the Rams to Inglewood over a plan Iger pushed to bring two teams to L.A.
And then there's Iger's biggest challenge of all: replacing himself before his retirement in 2018, a task he admits he has yet to fulfill after chosen heir Tom Staggs failed to impress the board. None of these topics were off-limits when Iger sat for a 90-minute interview in his office suite, which features a giant photo of Daisy Ridley in Star Wars and a wax statue of legendary NFL coach Vince Lombardi, which Iger found at an ESPN Zone restaurant.

Before you got this job, you explained your vision to the board for many months. Will that vetting process go on now with your potential successor?
Yes. It has been a rigorous process. The process is far from over, obviously. And the people being considered will be asked very much about who they are and what they are made of. What makes them tick? What their passions are, what their curiosities are, what they bring to the table in terms of their ability to run a company as large, as complex, as important, as valuable as this.
The question you hate: If you can't find someone, would you stay on?
(Laughs.) I said repeatedly, I have no intention of staying on.
But that phrasing leaves it open.
That's what everybody else says! I'm leaving in 2018.
Tom Staggs is said to have failed to impress the board with his vision for what he would do with the company. 
I think that's a little too specific. It wasn't about vision. I don't want to go back over old territory, but Tom spent a year as COO, and the succession process took place during that period of time. So it gave the board and, myself included, a chance to fully assess who Tom was, even though he worked for the company for a long time. What he represented, what he could do, how he fit in, how he might live up to the criteria that the board and others would expect of the CEO of the Walt Disney Co. And what was ultimately concluded is something I don't really need to discuss, but that very much was part of a succession process. Does that make sense?
Yes. 
Without characterizing what he lacked, what he had, etc.




Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm are run by individuals who operate outside the traditional Hollywood system and report to Alan Horn. John Lasseter and Ed Catmull do their thing in the Bay Area, mostly. Kevin Feige at Marvel operates as an island. And Kathleen Kennedy is running Lucasfilm from London and San Francisco and here.
I would turn that around. The essence of what they do is they are extreme insiders at how they manage, how they care for, where their passions lie for their own storytelling, their own brands and the meaning of Star Wars and Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar, Disney Animation. No one knows and has more passion about those stories and storytelling and those brands than they do. And that contributes greatly to their successes. What I've really tried to do is to not disrupt that.
Catmull's book is very much about how he and John maintain the separate cultures of Pixar and Disney Animation while imparting to Disney Animation the essence of what was working at Pixar. That's very tough.
I spent a full day at Pixar thanks to Steve Jobs and John Lasseter and Ed Catmull when I had broached to Steve the idea of buying Pixar. We began a conversation and I said, "I need to spend a day there. I need to go into the tent for a day." And he said, "Absolutely." I went completely alone. I didn't have a piece of paper and a pen. I had nothing to take notes on. I met every director; they each pitched me seven or eight films. I met everyone. And my takeaway was that there was a culture there that was extraordinary. And that the worst thing that we could do as a company would be to destroy or damage it in any way. When we valued Pixar, everybody said we spent too much for those assets, but a large chunk of what we were valuing was what would happen if we could actually infuse in Disney Animation a culture that wouldn't be exactly like Pixar but borrowed elements from it and ultimately turn the fortunes of Disney Animation around. Here we are in 2016, we look at Zootopia, which [grossed] a billion dollars coming off of Big Hero 6 and Frozen and Tangled and Wreck-It Ralph. It's all rooted in the knowledge that Ed and John, the so-called outsiders to Disney but insiders to Pixar, brought to the table. Usually it's the opposite: You buy a company and basically destroy the company.
Should Star Wars fans be worried about Rogue One doing reshoots? 
I've seen Rogue One. I've seen not only an edited picture but I've seen significantly more footage than was even in that picture. That's actually going to be a fine film.
You have another Lucasfilm property, Indiana Jones, and Steven Spielberg has agreed to make a fifth film. Will there be an Indiana Jones universe, eventually, like Star Wars?
Not like Star Wars, no. But we hope … right now, we're focused on a reboot, or a continuum and then a reboot of some sort.

From left: Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary of Shanghai; Wang Yang, China’s vice premier; and Iger during the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Disney park on June 16.
Reboot? You've got Harrison Ford for this movie, and then the presumption is there will be a younger …
Well, we'll bring him back, then we have to figure out what comes next. That's what I mean. It's not really a reboot, it's a boot — a reboot. I don't know.
THR has been using the term "requel" for these sequels that reboot the franchise. 
Requel. (Laughs.) We [got] Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones in the film. But then what's the direction? I've had discussions about what the direction is, [but] I don't want to get into it.




But you do see making more films?
Yes, I do. I don't think it reaches the scale of the universe of Star Wars, but I see making more. It won't be just a one-off.
Why do you think the Wanda guys have shown such public animosity toward Disney?
One Wanda guy.
The one Wanda guy who matters. 
I have no idea. I was as perplexed by that as anybody else. He owns AMC Theatres. Last I checked, we're a pretty significant part of that business, given the movies we make and they distribute. We've done nothing in terms of Shanghai Disneyland to in any way antagonize or intimidate any potential competitors. China is a big enough land from a people perspective and geography to house far more than one theme park company.

From left: Then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, Make-A-Wish Foundation CEO David Williams and then-Disney CEO-elect Iger in July 2005.
Have any of your executives been to the Wanda park that is open?
We've sent people to that, but I don't want to comment on what they've seen. I don't even want to comment on Wanda parks, except that we're not in the same business as they're in.
Speaking of people who have said things about Disney, let's talk about the Bernie Sanders thing. 
That was pleasant!
It was a little unusual to see you respond like that on Facebook. 
Bernie Sanders. Bernie Sanders. I thought about what he said, I thought about how misleading it was, how fact-less it was, how one-sided and unfair it was. I decided it was irresponsible and then I said, "He doesn't just have a right to tee off on us without someone responding." And who best to respond in terms of making a point and getting attention than me? And that's what I did. And by the way, if he does it again, I'll do it again!




This interview will come out after the California primary, so he may be less of a factor.
He criticizes us about wages, for instance. We're one of the first companies to commit to taking our minimum wage up to $10, which we did. Without anybody putting a gun to our head, we did it. It was the right thing to do. We said a few years ago we were going to hire veterans, and we've hired thousands of veterans. We've made huge investments in U.S. infrastructure. What we did at California Adventure [in Anaheim] a few years ago, that was more than $1 billion of investment and thousands of jobs. On the ground. In California. And the other thing that he pointed to, which I do not want to get into much detail about, but this whole notion of using people under the H-1B visa plan, that has been completely misconstrued.
How so?
We had a technology group in Orlando that was essentially trained in legacy technology that we were moving away from. We decided that we had to upgrade technology, and the best way to do it was to use a company from the outside to provide that help. That affected 250 jobs. So we went to 250 people and said, we're basically eliminating your jobs because we need this higher, more modern technology. We found jobs in our company for 100 of those people. That's nowhere to be found in the stories. So 150 of them were affected, which I don't take lightly. Although, in this changeover to new technology, we created another 170 jobs for other people. So the net result was actually more jobs rather than fewer. The mistake that was made is that we asked people who were leaving to help train their successors. That's common in the business, but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's right. And looking back, I'm sorry that we did that because there's something insulting about that. That got a huge amount of attention and rubbed people the wrong way, and I completely understand why it would. It just does not pass a smell test, even if it is common practice.
Some people say your post-Disney life will be in politics. 
Yeah, I've heard that. A lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office. All kinds of different jobs. Everybody has got a different idea for me, except all roads lead through my wife. (Laughs.)




But you wouldn't rule out a run for, say, governor of California?
I will not be specific about any office. I wouldn't rule in or rule out … Honestly, I'm interested in politics, I'm interested in giving back in some form, performing some sort of civic duty. But I'm not exploring a run for governor or senator or anything along those lines. I'm focused on running Disney. Does that answer the question?
Sure. What did you learn from your experience with the NFL and trying to bring the teams to L.A.?
Oh, God, I'm 65 years old and still learning things. The only thing I really learned was that I misread the chances going in. I actually thought the chances that we had — myself and the partnership with the Raiders and the Chargers — I thought the chances were better in the end than what I discovered they were. There was a very, very strong leaning going into that process to bring the Rams here, and I misread how strong that was. That's all. I wish, by the way, the Rams do great, [that] they build a great stadium.
Will you be a season-ticket holder?
I'm a lifetime Green Bay Packers fan. I doubt I'm going to be a season-ticket holder [in L.A.]. I'm going to keep my allegiance to the Packers.

And now you've got Aaron Rodgers' brother on The Bachelorette.
(Laughs.) Yes.
Some speculated NFL owners wanted to send a message that the NFL is bigger than Disney. Do you agree with that sentiment?
I have no idea. That's the first I've heard of that.
Would you ever be involved in owning another sports team?
Probably not.
Everyone asks, what is the fix for ESPN? You've said an improved digital offering is coming. Can you give a timeline for the ESPN digital rollout and what's going on there? 
Well, first of all, when people say "fix," that usually suggests something is really broken, and it's not. ESPN is not broken at all. ESPN, like a lot of other media entities, is facing challenges that they haven't faced before that are due to some very obvious circumstances, which is technology's effect on media both on the creative side, the distribution side and the consumption side. There's more competition, the [power] shift from the distributor and the creator to the consumer is pretty apparent. And it's critical to be as present as possible on all platforms, which ESPN is — but also to monetize them in as effective a way as possible. So what ESPN is exploring, they're creating more product that can be sold directly to the consumer, while at the same time doing what they can to make the product they sell to the distributors as vital as possible. In terms of timeline, I can only tell you there's a significant amount of work going on as we speak to move more ESPN product onto new platforms as fast as possible.
So there will be a stand-alone, live-sports, ESPN equivalent of HBO Now or CBS All Access? 
I'm not going to say that. Is it inevitable that ESPN will have a more direct consumer product in the marketplace? Yes. What that product is, to what extent it mirrors the product they have now and to what extent it is … I'll call it an offshoot. I can't get into those details. I don't think it's safe to assume ESPN is going to take the product it has now and immediately take it over the top like HBO did to sell directly to consumers.




It's even more complicated because many believe ESPN is propping up traditional distributor businesses as people subscribe to their bundle to get live sports.
ESPN plays a vital role in the health of the multichannel bundle, yes. That goes back to the old question of, to what extent are you a disruptor, to what extent do you allow yourself to get disrupted? That's a debate we have all the time.
ABC finished in fourth place this season, and some of the news properties are softening in ratings. How do you think Ben Sherwood is doing running the Disney-ABC TV Group?
Ben Sherwood is doing great. Ben Sherwood is a great competitor, meaning he loves to compete. And he also is realistic about the challenges that his businesses face, and he has a keen understanding that business as usual is not a successful strategy in a world that has become so unusual.
Kelly Ripa felt blindsided by Michael Strahan's move to Good Morning America. Do you think that situation could have been handled differently? 
(Laughs.) Here's what I'm not going to do here. I'm not going to extend that narrative.

With Apple CEO Jobs in September 2006.
People said it was Ben's first public challenge in that role.
He's had many other challenges.
Hulu, which Disney co-owns, is going to offer live TV channels, which seems to be a rival to the traditional cable bundle. How do you reconcile those?
I don't mind that. I like aiding and abetting more opportunity for content owners, channel owners. And I like the idea of it entering the marketplace as an alternative to other forms of distribution, because there are many alternatives cropping up.
It's an interesting situation for Comcast, which backs Hulu and has its massive cable business. And now Hulu is in the distribution business.
Right. When Comcast bought NBCUniversal, what's the difference? Make my day, Comcast. (Laughs.) Come after us because we're going into the distribution business. Didn't you go into the content business and the theme park business? Really?
And Comcast is investing heavily in theme parks and coming after you in animation [with the purchase of DreamWorks Animation].
I saw someone's comment from the investor community, "My goodness, they're biting the hand that feeds them" or "What signal does this send to their distributors?" Well, what signal does this send to the content owners when the distributors go into the content business? I haven't lost sleep over that, but it happens.




I haven't heard it described that way. 
But that's what it is! It's the exact same thing. If anything, you could argue that it's less so because Hulu is an upstart, whereas they bought NBCUniversal! They bought cable channels, they bought theme parks, they bought a movie studio. They went into direct competition with us in broadcast TV, in local TV, in cable TV, in the theme park business and in movies. That's a lot. By the way, I'm not complaining about it, but it's hard to believe that us taking Hulu into the direction of becoming a multichannel distributor is something that anybody should be worried about in terms of the message that it sends.
Do you think there will be a correction in the value of sports-rights deals?
There isn't one in sight.
Even if ESPN stops pumping up prices? 
Well, ESPN was pumping them up and Fox and Comcast and Time Warner [too]. I last saw Twitter bought some [NFL] rights. Yahoo is bidding on rights. Who knows what Verizon will do. I don't see one in sight.

Maybe in five years, seven years? 
When I'm governor of California. (Laughs.)
When you're the governor, do you see the same number of Hollywood studios? Will there be consolidation? Will a tech company buy something?
I don't think I would describe them as studios. Not that there aren't studios today. I think there's a general belief — general among not just the industry we're in but an expanded set of the industry that includes tech companies and various new entrants into media — there's a general belief that content is king. You will see more investment in that and that will mean more entrants into it. I wouldn't conclude that they would become studios per se, but makers of content, as you've already seen in TV and movies with Netflix and Amazon. I saw Jeff Bezos not long ago, and he was describing what he was doing. He's making movies!
Amazon had a great party at Cannes.
Is [Amazon] a studio? What is it? Netflix. Studio?




Do you think Wanda or another Chinese company would take a stake in Paramount if it becomes available? 
Now you're back to Wanda. I don't know what Wanda is up to. I do not know.
Speaking of Paramount, are you close at all with Sumner Redstone?
No. I had dinner with Sumner twice that someone arranged, but I have no relationship with Sumner.
How will that Viacom saga play out? 
Your guess is as good as mine. You know what, we're fortunate as a company that we don't have any of that kind of complexity.
Which of the other media moguls are you close to?
I've been in the business for 42 years and I've been in this job for almost 11. So yes, I know Philippe [Dauman] and Sumner and Brad Grey, Jeff Bewkes, Kevin Tsujihara a little bit. Ron Meyer, Jeff Shell, Steve Burke, Brian Roberts, Michael Lynton, Jim Gianopulos, Rupert Murdoch.

Iger and Bay with sons Robert “Maxwell” Iger (right) and William at the 2011 NBA All-Star Game at Staples Center.
Do you know the sons?
I know Lachlan and James. Not well, but yeah.
The sense is the entertainment industry has taken a backseat in terms of prestige and attention to Silicon Valley. Do you agree?
They're the ones that are trying to get into our business!
Where does that put entertainment in terms of the pecking order?
I won't speak for the entertainment industry. I speak for Disney. I've seen people in the industry come to work every morning paranoid about what the other person or other company is doing. That means you're spending time and focus on somebody else's business instead of your own.




What is success to you for the Shanghai park?
Well, the first thing is just making sure people thoroughly enjoy the experience and that it is operationally smooth, meaning everything is working, crowds are being maintained effectively, the food is good.
I read about the dollar dumplings.
Speaking of dumplings, about 70 percent of the food is Chinese and a lot of it is Shanghai food, although we actually have a restaurant that has seven different areas in it that represent seven different areas of China and their food.
One thing I find amusing about the park is there is no Main Street USA.
That was my doing. I'm pretty well steeped in park lore, and I certainly knew that Main Street was based on Walt's drive from his hometown. I like Main Street a lot, but I did not think it would resonate with the people of China in any way.

Daughters Kathleen (right) and Amanda with Bay and Iger.
Do you have Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean in the park?
Yes.
And Johnny Depp's personal problems?
Not worried about it.
The scandal will pass?
I don't know whether it passes or not. We have Jack Sparrow.
You think people separate.
Right.
How's your relationship with Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter these days?
My relationship with Ike is good.


But you allowed Marvel's Kevin Feige to move from under Ike to under film chief Alan Horn. That didn't rankle Ike?
Sure it did.
Do you see Ike being a major player at this company for a while?
What does a major player mean?
Major stockholder. Influencer.
I have no idea what he does with his stock. He's made a lot of money on the Marvel transaction, and he's made a lot of money on Disney stock since he took it as part of the transaction and bought more since then. And he gets a big dividend. I'm actually not in his head in that regard, so I don't know and he doesn't in any way discuss it with me. He likes to call me at seven in the morning. Sometimes I'll say, "Ike, I've just pushed the button on the coffee maker and I haven't had my first cup yet, so I need 10 minutes."
Who do you lean on when making decisions? Who are your confidants?
I have a great team. I have [communications chief] Zenia [Mucha], a great general counsel [Alan Braverman], chief strategy officer [Kevin Mayer],I have a very strong and relatively new CFO [Christine McCarthy], and I have a great head of HR [Jayne Parker]. That's the core corporate team. And then the business unit team, Alan Horn is right down the hall and Ben [Sherwood], who is relatively new. This is a team I work very closely with. For instance, we have lunch every Monday. We had lunch today for an hour and a half, and the first thing I did was show them a seven-minute video of Shanghai … just to get everybody in a good mood. Then we did a business update, we talked about Wanda, we talked about some of ESPN's issues, we congratulated ourselves that we have the Warriors and the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. It's a mutually supportive environment. There's always politics in any company, but it's a fairly politically free senior team. I'm going to share everything with you. If you burn me, that ends the sharing process.

James Stewart on Disney’s C.E.O.


“Disney is still facing a pretty imminent deadline to come up with a successor with no obvious heirs apparent in sight,” said James Stewart of The New York Times.

LOS ANGELES — Robert A. Iger has extended his reign at the Magic Kingdom for a third time, as an heir continues to be difficult to find.The Walt Disney Company said on Thursday that Mr. Iger, 66, will remain chief executive and chairman until July 2019, an extension of one year beyond his previously pushed back retirement date, reflecting a continuing streak of success at the world’s largest entertainment company but also the lack of a clear successor.“Succession is a complicated thing, and the board and I felt that we could use more time to not only spend on succession but to create a better transition,” Mr. Iger said during a midmorning appearance at a previously scheduled University of Southern California event. He was interviewed on stage by his wife, Willow Bay, the newly named dean of U.S.C.’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.Mr. Iger said that wielding long-term corporate power can be corrosive.“When your convictions prove to be right more than wrong, you get really confident,” he said. “You easily get more dismissive of other people’s ideas and other people’s convictions. So I want to be really careful that I leave at a time when I’m not only feeling like I’m at the top of my game but when it’s absolutely right for the company.” As for his multiple renewals, he added, “I’m serious about it this time.”

Under the contract extension, Mr. Iger’s compensation will be determined on the same basis as before, according to a securities filing. But the new deal provides for a $5 million bonus if he completes the term. He will also remain close to the company after stepping down: The extension calls for him to serve as a consultant for three additional years, with pay of $2 million for each of the first two and $1 million for the third.

Disney’s share price climbed on Thursday morning after the news.The question now is who will follow him. Since he took over in 2005, Mr. Iger has led Disney to record financial results, even in the face of economic downturns, the occasional horrendous movie write-off and changing consumer habits that have dented ESPN, its primary profit engine.The downside: Nobody seems to measure up, complicating succession at a company that has a history of bumpy transfers of power. (Mr. Iger’s predecessor, Michael D. Eisner, tried to cling to his job, resulting in him eventually turning over a company that was struggling.) The obvious internal candidate to succeed Mr. Iger, the well-regarded Thomas O. Staggs, abruptly left Disney last year after losing the unqualified support of Mr. Iger and some other board members. Since then, Disney has been engaged in a quiet hunt for a successor, with an emphasis on outside candidates.

“The longer we can have Bob Iger running the show, the happier I will be,” said Trip Miller, the founder of Gullane Capital Partners, which holds a long position in Disney. “At the same time, short-term investors have gotten very tied into this succession issue, and I think this clears that up a bit. Iger announcing a new retirement deadline tells me that perhaps succession planning is further along than we thought.”Even among media conglomerates, Disney has a unique mix of businesses, some of which are healthier than others. The company’s movie studio is widely regarded as the strongest in Hollywood — “Beauty and the Beast,” released last week, has already taken in more than $425 million worldwide — and the Disney theme parks are delivering record profits. But the company’s vast consumer products division has been in decline, and Disney’s television operation, which includes ABC, Disney Channel and Freeform, has been struggling with ratings weakness and a lack of breakout shows.Mr. Iger, who is also a member of the Apple board, started his entertainment career at ABC in 1974. Disney has no mandatory retirement age for chief executives; the company’s mandatory retirement age for board members is 74.It was clear from his remarks at Thursday’s event, which focused on the future of technology and entertainment, that Mr. Iger still enjoys his job. He spoke about recently visiting a Disney research and development lab to test a “Star Wars” virtual-reality experience — he had “a lightsaber duel with a Stormtrooper,” he said — and watching early footage from films on his laptop. Ms. Bay noted that their last family Christmas card had a photo of Mr. Iger riding a roller coaster at Shanghai Disneyland.As for Mr. Iger’s post-Disney life, there has long been speculation in Hollywood that he holds political aspirations.“I’m not thinking much about it,” he told Ms. Bay. “There’s a whole world out there for me to enjoy.”

Robert A. Iger may swing for a three-peat. The Walt Disney chief executive is considering delaying for the third time his departure from atop the House of Mouse. It’s a sign that the entertainment conglomerate has failed to find a replacement for him since Tom Staggs left last year. Clinging to power, though, can get messy.Executives at Disney are betting that Mr. Iger, who has run the company for 12 years and will turn 66 on Friday, will have to stick around longer, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. By all accounts, Mr. Iger is a worthy boss. After he took over in 2005, Disney’s market value rose from $46 billion to about $148 billion at the end of its 2016 fiscal year. Total shareholder return over the same period increased 350 percent, Disney said in its proxy.Beyond the numbers, Mr. Iger has improved the company by making savvy acquisitions such as the $4 billion deal for the “Star Wars” studio, Lucasfilm. And no company is better at cross-promoting its products: Princess Elsa costumes from the animated movie “Frozen” are a big hit with toddlers, for example.

A successor will need time and guidance to learn the ways of Disney’s sprawling divisions, from movie studios to theme parks to cable networks. Challenges are cropping up, too: The cable sports network ESPN, traditionally the company’s biggest money-spinner, is losing subscribers as more people drop paid-TV packages. Navigating the hurdles of changing news media habits will take exceptional fortitude. Continue reading the main story

A chief executive’s longevity can bring needed experience and stability. That’s useful in a crisis: Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon have run their companies for almost as long as Mr. Iger has. But it can also store up resentment among underlings and risk complacency. Richard S. Fuld Jr., for example, headed Lehman for 14 years before its collapse.Mr. Iger has a cautionary tale much closer to home: His predecessor Michael Eisner’s 21 years in command ended after a series of bumbling decisions and his rancorous spat with Michael Ovitz, Disney’s former president, led to an investor revolt.Mr. Iger has been good for Disney, but he, too, risks overstaying his welcome.

CUPERTINO, Calif. — Apple® today named Arthur D. Levinson, Ph. D. as the Company’s non-executive Chairman of the Board. Levinson has been a co-lead director of Apple’s board since 2005, has served on all three board committees—audit and finance, nominating and corporate governance, and compensation—and will continue to serve on the audit committee. Apple also announced that Robert A. Iger, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, will join Apple’s board and will serve on the audit committee.
“Art has made enormous contributions to Apple since he joined the board in 2000,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “He has been our longest serving co-lead director, and his insight and leadership are incredibly valuable to Apple, our employees and our shareholders.”
“Bob and I have gotten to know one another very well over the past few years and on behalf of the entire board, we think he is going to make an extraordinary addition to our already very strong board,” said Tim Cook. “His strategic vision for Disney is based on three fundamentals: generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world which makes him a great fit for Apple.”

Sounds like Cook is trying to sell Iger as the new Steve Jobs.












Hussman • 						on  Nov 15, 2011 3:47 pm


I think the real story is Levinson taking the Chairman post.  Iger appears to understand the Apple culture, but I wouldn’t expect him to be designing products…












dempublican • 						on  Nov 16, 2011 6:08 pm


Sounds like Iger IS the new Tim Cook, which was the new Steve Jobs.
There was an article and internal memos on Iger’s relationship with Jobs since the Pixar purchase–and it was personal. Iger’s a Wall Street darling (everyone know’s him), so compared to Cook AND that Iger’s CEO lease is up in 2015 (before $$$ Disney Shanghai and Avatar-land open–hmmm… jumping ship?) I think we have our new Apple CEO starting in 2015.

Iger is the devil.  This is is the one move that could send me back to a PC.

This is quite interesting since Lassiter hates Iger…with a passion…

I think the world of fashion can teach techs a lesson. Lee McQueen- (ultimately a more insane visionary than Steve Jobs- relentless nonetheless)however, LVMH- a corporation- let the Protege lead…  To become fan fave… And designer of royal wedding stature. Bar raised…

Iger is the luckiest man since Ringo Starr — if Cook thinks he can sell Iger as the next Jobs he’s out of his mind — it was like when Eisner tried to present himself as the next Walt on the Wonderful World of Disney; total fail.  Iger is an opportunistic grievance collector with terrible taste and zero creativity.  He is the last guy Apple should put onboard.  Anyone want to buy my iMac, MacBook, iPad or my iPhone.  Egads.  Iger?












Vato Loco • 						on  Nov 15, 2011 7:58 pm


You are all wrong. The reason Iger was brought on was to wrap up content for the Foreseeable future. Iger and Jobs became good friends after Pixar was bought by Disney. That in turn lead to content deals with Apple based on that relationship. When Jobs died his place on the Disney Board became vacant. To keep Disney close and as an act of good will, Iger was asked to become an Apple board Member thereby maintaining the content relationship.












Yekimi • 						on  Nov 15, 2011 8:12 pm


They already have the ipod, imac, iphone. To fit in with the rest of their products, Apple will de-capitalize  his last name and call him iger.

Disney CEO Robert Iger announces "ironclad" policy of no smoking in youth-rated Disney movies




Submitted by sglantz on Fri, 2015-03-13 08:46


Yesterday (March 12, 2015) Dr. Gina Intinarelli, a cardiothoracic nurse from UCSF and I attended the Walt Disney Corp.  annual meeting.   During the question and answer period, Gina told Disney CEO and Chairman of the Board Robert Iger of the thousands of patients with heart disease and cancer she had care for, that virtually all of these people started smoking as kids, and that the US Surgeon General had concluded that exposure to smoking onscreen caused kids to start smoking.  She pointed out that nearly half of the Marvel movies (Disney owns Marvel) had contained smoking.  She then asked Mr. Iger for if Disney would implement an “ironclad” policy of keeping smoking.
 
Iger responded definitively.  Here is how it was reported in The Guardian:
 

	Walt Disney chairman and CEO Bob Iger said he would “absolutely prohibit” smoking in all Disney films going forward, including those produced by the studio’s wholly owned comic-book-movie division, Marvel Studios, and Star Wars unit Lucasfilm.
	 
	“I thought it was the right thing for us to do,” said Iger, who was responding to a query from an investor. “We are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board: Marvel, Lucas, Pixar and Disney films,” he said. “Except when we are depicting a historical figure who may have smoked at the time. For instance, we’ve been doing a movie on Abraham Lincoln, he was a smoker, and we would consider that acceptable.
	 
	“But in terms of any new characters that are created for any of those films, under any of those labels, we will absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films.”

 
I was the next person to question Mr. Iger.  I thanked him, but pointed out that the policy on Disney’s website (which dates from 2007) contained loopholes for “creative necessity” and that many Disney films in recent years (but not last year) included smoking.  He said that this decision had been made in the last 48 hours and that the policy on Disney’s website would be updated accordingly.
 
If the actual policy is written as unequivocally as Iger’s statement yesterday, this is a huge step forward and a major contribution to preventing millions of deaths worldwide.
 
I then went on and told Mr. Iger that the CDC has reported that an R rating for smoking would save a million US kids lives and asked him if Disney would follow up its policy by using its position as one of the 6 companies that comprise the board of and control the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) if it would public urge other media companies to follow its lead and support an R rating for smoking. 
 
He responded that he would not tell other companies what to do and that Disney  has no control over the rating of individual films and that the rating system was independently managed . 
 
I responded that I was not talking about Disney controlling ratings of individual films but rather changing the MPAA’s rules that it uses to rate individual films on the grounds that the MPAA board makes MPAA policy.
 
He responded that we should be talking to the MPAA.  It told him that there had been several meetings  by health groups with the MPAA, and that the MPAA told them to work with the studios.   It pointed out that we had a situation in which the MPAA was telling us to talk to the studios and the studios were point to the MPAA, leaving no one to solve the problem, but that the MPAA board (which consists of the 6 major studios) had the authority to solve the problem.
 
Mr. Iger also questioned Disney’s lawyer (who sits on the MPAA board) as well as Alan Horn (head of Walt Disney Studios) about these arrangements. 
 

	Here is how Hollywood Reporter reported the exchange:
	 
	Iger was called on to reiterate his pledge of not showing characters smoking on TV or in movies except where necessary for historical accuracy, though one shareholder asked him to go further by asking the MPAA to give an R-rating to movies that include smoking and to rally other studios to support such a measure. 
	Iger said it would be "a little presumptuous" to tell other studios what to do or to tell the MPAA how it should rate movies. The shareholder noted that he had spoken to the MPAA about his idea, and the MPAA told him to speak to the studios, so he was now getting the runaround.
	"I think the MPAA is kind of talking out of both sides of its mouth, and the result is a million kids are going to die unnecessarily," said the shareholder.

 
While we did not win a commitment to push the MPAA, I do think that this exchange did inform both Mr. Iger, as well as Disney’s senior management and full board, about the MPAA’s behavior and the fact that the MPAA was pushing us on to the studios.   Perhaps this exchange will lead to some changes in the future.
 
Overall, a good day.
 
I also want to thank As You Sow and the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility for working with us over the years to press all the studios on the smoking issue.  Their work (including pursuing several shareholder resolutions), made an important contribution to this step.  They also obtained proxies (from  Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia and Trinity Health) so Gina and I could attend the meeting.

Here is the transcript of the discussion at the Disney meeting
It's worth carefully reading what Disney CEO Bob Iger and their General Counsel said about smoking in movies and the MPAA at their annual meeting:
 
The Walt Disney Company Annual Meeting, San Francisco, March 12, 2015
Official audio recording available at http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/uvuz3kf4.
 
(Time 53 min: 12 sec) Gina Intinarelli: My name is Gina [Intinarelli-]Shuler. I’m a shareholder, I live in San Francisco, I’m also a critical care nurse. I’ve been a nurse for 25 years and I have taken care of thousands of patients who have died of tobacco-related diseases.  We know that the Surgeon General produced a report in 2012 that showed conclusively that if children are exposed to smoking images in movies it will cause them to begin smoking.  Any of us who have known smokers or have known people that have died from smoking know that they started when they were young.  Disney has a policy to discourage smoking in youth rated films, but between 2008 and 2013 about 9% of all smoking images shown to children were from Disney studios.  However, in 2014 and so far this year there have been no smoking images in any Disney films [applause].  This shows a commitment to real corporate responsibility to children’s future health.  However, [for Disney’s] Marvel studios, you may not know, 43% of their youth rated movies show smoking. So, Mr. Iger, I ask if you will be willing to change the world and commit to an iron-clad policy that your PG13 and youth rated films never show smoking in them. 
 
Robert Iger: Well, the answer to that is “yes.” I will commit to that, we are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board, Marvel, Lucas, Pixar, Disney films, except when we are depicting an historical figure who may have smoked at the time of his life. So for instance, if we were doing a movie on Abraham Lincoln, he was a smoker, then we would consider that acceptable. But in terms of any new characters that are created under any of those labels we would absolutely prohibit smoking in any of those films.
 
(intervening question)
 
(time 58 min: 58 sec) Stanton Glantz: My name is Stanton Glantz. I’m a Professor of Medicine at UC San Francisco and have been working on the issue of smoking in the movies for a long time. I’d first like to thank you for the unequivocal statement about getting smoking out of youth rated films that Disney produces and distributes.  I would point out that the policy that you have on your website isn’t as strong as what you just said and would hope that you would see that they are brought into sync.  My question is:  The CDC has estimated that an R rating for smoking in movies would save a million kids’ lives among kids alive today in the United States, will Disney take a public position in support of an industry-wide standard of an R rating for smoking and use its seat on the MPAA to push for an industry-wide level playing field policy that would essentially institutionalize the policy that you just outlined, since we do  think an exception for actual historical figures who actually smoked is appropriate?
 
Iger: First of all, I will make sure that the policy that is described on our website reflects the policy that I just articulated.  The policy that I articulated was amended within the last 48 hours, actually it would be broader than the policy that we had because I thought it was the right thing for us to do.
 
We are a member of the MPAA, however, we don’t get involved in how the MPAA applies ratings to films.  They do that independent of us and occasionally we lobby with them on how they’ve rated some of our films but we certainly don’t get involved in how they rate the films of other studios nor do we really try to influence what the policies are of the other studios that we compete with.  We just like to think that we have a responsibility to shareholders of the company and to customers around the world and we like to behave in a very, very responsible way in that regard as evidenced by the policy that I outlined.  So I doubt that you are going to get much support from us on lobbying the MPAA to put an R rating on films that have smoking.   I think it would be a little bit presumptuous of me to commit to doing that today without getting a little bit more of a flavor or perspective on the dynamic that exists at the MPAA on the subject. I’m just not well versed in that. I don’t know what positions the other studios have even taken about this.
 
Glantz: We have had meetings with the MPAA and they’ve told us to go to the studios because it’s the studios that sit on the [MPAA] board and make the policies.  So the MPAA actually is why I’m asking you this question, because the MPAA has told a wide range of health groups and representatives and groups like the American  Academy of Pediatrics that it is really up to the studios to make the policy and the MPAA is just implementing the policies that the six studios on the board establish.  So it’s a little bit back and forth.
 
Iger: I think there might be nuance there.  It’s up to the studios to make policy regarding their own standards and the films that they create as I describe for Disney.  I don’t believe it’s up to the studios to set ratings policy for the MPAA.  They determine how they apply ratings independent really of even the six board members that sit on the MPAA.  I’ll inquire to see if I am accurate in that regard.  Alan  [Braverman, Disney General  Counsel]  …
 
Glantz: The board doesn’t rate [individual] movies but the rules for rating, the policies that are implemented in the ratings, the MPAA has told us, are determined by the board of directors of the MPAA and then implemented by the MPAA.
 
Iger: Our General Counsel Alan Braverman is here and he is one of our representatives on the MPAA board.  Alan, you have a microphone …
 
Alan Braverman: It’s a separate group than the MPAA board.  It’s a separate group that administers the ratings in an independent fashion. I think the best way to close out this conversation is to take the point to the group that administers the ratings because there is a dynamic that goes on within that group and the purpose of that rating organization was to set up an entity independent of the studios to apply a series of ratings to the studio productions so that studios were not engaged themselves in self-rating their own content.
 
Iger: We will make sure that we communicate at least to the board of the MPAA that this came up at our shareholders meeting and you brought it up.
 
Glantz: I’d appreciate an opportunity later for some more detailed discussions because I think the MPAA is talking out of both sides of its mouth and the result is that a million kids are going to die unnecessarily.
 
Iger: It’s a serious issue, I agree with you.

Major health groups tell Iger that MPAA says studios in charge
After the exchange between Professor Stanton Glantz and Disney CEO Bob Iger in which Mr. Iger said that the studios did not control MPAA ratings policy, the four health groups that last met with the MPAA wrote Iger confirming to him that the MPAA had said that the studios are the policymakers.  The MPAA just implements the policy.
	 
	Disney, along with the 5 other major studios, make up the MPAA Board of Directors.
	 
	Here is their letter:
	 
	March 18, 2015
	 
	 
	Robert Iger
	Chairman and CEO
	The Walt Disney Company
	500 S Buena Vista Street
	Burbank, CA 91505
	 
	 
	Dear Mr. Iger,
	 
	As public health organizations committed to reducing tobacco use we thank you for strengthening Disney’s smoke-free movies policy. In America, tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death resulting in 480,000 premature deaths a year. 
	 
	Disney’s actions are an important step to help prevent millions of teens from beginning to smoke. In 2012 the United States Surgeon General concluded that exposure to onscreen smoking causes young people to start smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently concluded that an R rating for movies featuring smoking would be expected to reduce the number of teen smokers by nearly twenty percent preventing one million deaths from smoking among children alive today.
	 
	While we are delighted by Disney’s actions, eliminating smoking in youth rated movies is a policy that should be adopted industry-wide.  In fact, our organizations have repeatedly advocated that youth rated movies should be rated R unless the movie clearly and unambiguously reflects the dangers and consequences of smoking or if it accurately depicts the behavior of an actual, historical figure.  We have had discussions with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), but have been told repeatedly that it will not act without direction from the studios.  Since data indicate that individual movie company policies alone have not been shown to be efficient in minimizing smoking in movies, we hope Disney can take a leadership role within the MPAA to move it towards a rating system that prohibits smoking in youth rated movies.
	 
	We appreciate Disney’s leadership on this issue and we welcome collaboration to encourage other studios to eliminate on-screen smoking and tobacco use as a cause of youth smoking.
	 
	Sincerely,

Stronger approach needed
Even better than a ratings change, would be for bans on manufacturing, selling, and giving away tobacco products.  That would follow 19th century precedent before the focus changed to weak anti-tobacco actions.  States such as Iowa, http://medicolegal.tripod.com/iowalaw1897.htm , Tennessee, http://medicolegal.tripod.com/tennlaw1897.htm , and Michigan, http://medicolegal.tripod.com/milaw1909.htm, outright banned cigarettes in this way.
State action occurred when Congress refused to act against tobacco.  It had been asked years before, when in 1892, Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) members during the  1879-1898 tenure of Francis Willard, M.S., M.A., LL.D., sent to Congress thousands of petitions for banning cigarettes, citing the already then-known fact that cigarettes were "causing insanity and death to thousands" of people.

Two points that need to be clarified with Mr. Iger 
At the shareholders' meeting, Mr. Iger said, "we are extending our policy to prohibit smoking in movies across the board, Marvel, Lucas, Pixar, Disney films...".  This list does not include Touchstone, which is the Disney brand that has released most of the Disney movies with smoking.
 
First, we need to clarify whether this was just an inadvertent omission and that the policy will include all Disney brands (i.e., across the board) or whether it just applies to the bands that Iger listed.  Hopefully it will be the former.
 
Second, we need to clarify that the policy applies to all films that Disney distributes, not just the films that it produces.  This is a loophole that several other studios have hidden behind.  Again, hopefully "across the board" includes these films, too.
 
These issues should be resolved in the formal published policy when Disney makes it available.

Signature





Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]
Over the course of his career, Iger has been recognized by several major media publications for his leadership at Disney, having been named one of Fortune Magazine's "25 Most Powerful People in Business" (2006, 2007), a "Top Gun CEO" by Forbes (2009), a "Best CEO" by Institutional Investor Magazine (2008-2011), "CEO of the Year" by MarketWatch (2006), and "CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive Magazine (2014).[2] Iger has also been inducted as a member of several organizations, including the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Toy Industry Hall of Fame.[2][14][15][16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]
Over the course of his career, Iger has been recognized by several major media publications for his leadership at Disney, having been named one of Fortune Magazine's "25 Most Powerful People in Business" (2006, 2007), a "Top Gun CEO" by Forbes (2009), a "Best CEO" by Institutional Investor Magazine (2008-2011), "CEO of the Year" by MarketWatch (2006), and "CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive Magazine (2014).[2] Iger has also been inducted as a member of several organizations, including the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Toy Industry Hall of Fame.[2][14][15][16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Robert Allen Iger (/ˈaɪɡər/; born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman who is chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Walt Disney Company.[2][3][4] Before Disney, Iger served as the president of ABC Television from 1994 to 1995 and the president and chief operating officer (COO) of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. from 1995 until Disney's acquisition of the company in 1996.[5][6] He was named president and COO of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as CEO in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company.[7][8] As part of his yearly compensation, Iger earned $44.9 million in 2015.[1]
During Iger’s tenure, Disney broadened the company's roster of intellectual properties and its presence in international markets; Iger oversaw the acquisitions of Pixar in 2006 for $7.4 billion, Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion, and Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4.06 billion,[9] as well as the expansion of the company's theme park resorts in East Asia, with the introduction of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort in 2005 and 2016, respectively.[10] Iger was also a driving force behind the reinvigoration of Walt Disney Animation Studios and the branded-release strategy of its film studio's output.[11][12] Under Iger's control, Disney has experienced increases in revenue across its various divisions, with the company's market capitalization value increasing from $48.4 billion to $163 billion over a period of eleven years.[9][13] As a result, Disney has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Reputable Companies" by Forbes (2006–2015), one of "America's Most Admired Companies" by Fortune Magazine (2009–2015), one of the “World's Most Respected Companies" by Barron’s (2009–2014), a “Best Place to Launch a Career” by BusinessWeek Magazine (2006–2010), and a "Company of the Year" by Yahoo Finance (2013).[2]
Over the course of his career, Iger has been recognized by several major media publications for his leadership at Disney, having been named one of Fortune Magazine's "25 Most Powerful People in Business" (2006, 2007), a "Top Gun CEO" by Forbes (2009), a "Best CEO" by Institutional Investor Magazine (2008-2011), "CEO of the Year" by MarketWatch (2006), and "CEO of the Year" by Chief Executive Magazine (2014).[2] Iger has also been inducted as a member of several organizations, including the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame, and the Toy Industry Hall of Fame.[2][14][15][16]

Early life[edit]
Iger was born to a Jewish family in New York City.[5][17] Iger was raised in the Long Island town of Oceanside, New York, where he attended the Fulton Avenue School and graduated from Oceanside High School in 1969.[18][19] In 1973, he graduated magna cum laude from the Roy H. Park School of Communications at Ithaca College with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television and Radio.[20]
Iger is the son of Mimi (née Tunick) and Arthur L. Iger.[21][22] His father was a World War II veteran who served as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and was also a Professor of Advertising and Public Relations.[21] His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside.[23][24]
Career[edit]
Iger began his media career in 1972 as the host of “Campus Probe,” an Ithaca College television show. He dreamed of becoming a news anchor while he worked as a weatherman in Ithaca for five months, before shifting his career goals.[25][26]
American Broadcasting Company (ABC)[edit]
In 1974, Iger joined the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).[4][27]
In 1989, Iger was named to head up ABC Entertainment. He served as President of the ABC Network Television Group from January 1993 to 1994, while being appointed as Capital Cities/ABC Senior Vice President in March 1993 and Executive Vice President in July 1993.[28]
In 1994, Iger was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC's corporate parent, Capital Cities/ABC.[6]
The Walt Disney Company[edit]
In 1996, The Walt Disney Company purchased Capital Cities/ABC and renamed it ABC, Inc., where Iger remained President until 1999.[5]
On February 25, 1999, Disney named Iger the President of Walt Disney International, the business unit that oversees Disney's international operations, as well as Chairman of the ABC Group. Disney called the change a promotion for Iger. Some[who?] viewed this claim skeptically since Iger was being removed from day-to-day authority at the struggling ABC.[29]
Disney named Iger the President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) on January 24, 2000, making him Disney's No. 2 executive under Chairman and CEO, Michael Eisner. Disney had been without a separate president since Eisner assumed the role following the departure of Michael Ovitz in 1997, after sixteen months at Disney.[30]
As a result of a a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake up the management of the company, Disney begun a search for the next CEO to replace Eisner. On March 13, 2005, Disney announced that Iger would succeed Michael Eisner as CEO, and Iger was placed in charge of day-to-day operations though Eisner held the title of CEO until he resigned on September 30, 2005. On March 26, Iger reassigned Peter Murphy, Disney's Chief Strategic Officer, and pledged to disband the company's Strategic Planning division. Iger also vowed to restore much of the decision-making authority that the division had assumed to the company's individual business units. Disney reconciled with former board members Roy E. Disney and Stanley Gold, who in July 2005 dropped their "Save Disney" campaign and agreed to work with Iger. In the process, Roy E. Disney was named a Director Emeritus and Consultant.
On January 24, 2006, Disney announced it would acquire Pixar for $7.4 billion in an all-stock transaction. The merger installed animator John Lasseter as Chief Creative Officer of the Pixar and Principal Creative Advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering, the division that designs theme park attractions. This acquisition made Steve Jobs Disney's top shareholder, with seven percent of outstanding shares, and gave him a new seat on Disney's Board of Directors. In the same year, Iger also re-acquired the rights to Walt Disney's first star, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, from NBCUniversal by releasing sportscaster Al Michaels from ABC Sports to NBC Sports.
In August 2009, Iger spearheaded negotiations that led Disney to acquire Marvel Entertainment and its associated assets for $4 billion. As of August 2014, Disney has recouped over $4 billion at the box office through the Marvel movies.[31]




Iger at the World of Color Premiere, Disney California Adventure, June 2010


Roy E. Disney issued this statement regarding Iger:

Animation has always been the heart and soul of The Walt Disney Company, and it is wonderful to see Bob Iger and the company embraces that heritage by bringing the outstanding animation talent of the Pixar team back into the fold. This clearly solidifies The Walt Disney Company's position as the dominant leader in motion picture animation and we applaud and support Bob Iger's vision.[32]

Iger has cited international expansion, technological innovation, and a renewed focus on traditional animation as Disney's top strategic priorities.[33] On October 7, 2011, Disney announced that Iger would become Chairman of the Board, following John Pepper's retirement from the board in March 2012.[34]
On Tuesday November 15, 2011, Apple, Inc., now led by CEO Tim Cook after Steve Jobs's death, named Iger as a Director, and named Genentech Chairman Arthur Levinson, an Apple board member with a past membership on rival Google's board, as Jobs's replacement in the role of non-executive Chairman; both will serve on Apple's Audit Committee. Jobs had worked with Iger in the Pixar acquisition which had made Jobs the largest shareholder of Disney, and Iger licensed ABC shows to Apple for purchase through iTunes.[35]
In October 2012, Iger signed a deal with film producer George Lucas to purchase Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4 billion following several months of negotiations between the two men. As a result, Disney acquired the rights to the Star Wars multimedia franchise and Indiana Jones.[36] Disney has since embarked on plans to produce a series of Star Wars films and an Indiana Jones one. Following its release on December 18, 2015, Star Wars: The Force Awakens grossed over $2 billion at the box office. In addition, Iger has announced that the $5.5 billion Shanghai Disney Resort will open its doors on June 16, 2016.[37]
Thomas O. Staggs, former Disney CFO and Chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, was named chief operating officer (COO) on On February 5, 2015, making him Iger's heir-apparent. However on April 4, 2016, Disney announced that Staggs and the company had mutually agreed to part ways, and Staggs stepped down as COO effective May 6, 2016. It was reported that Staggs failed to receive assurances from the board to succeed Iger, as the board decided instead to widen the executive search, while Iger also did not persuade Staggs to stay on. Iger contract as Disney's Chairman and CEO was originally planned to run until June 30, 2018,[38][39] but Disney announced in March 2017 that it was extending Iger's term to July 2, 2019 and said he would serve as a consultant for the following three years.[40][41] During the Walt Disney Company's first quarter earnings call (in 2017), Bob Iger stated "If it's in the best interest of the company to expand my tenure, I'm open to that..." [42]
National Football League (NFL)[edit]
In November 2015, the Oakland Raiders and San Diego Chargers named Iger to head their effort to build a new stadium hosting both teams in Carson, California. Had the bid been accepted by the NFL, Iger would have had the option to purchase a minority ownership in one of the teams.[43]
Personal life[edit]
Iger has been married twice. His first marriage to Kathleen Susan Iger ended in divorce.[44] They had two children: Kathleen Pamela Iger and Amanda Iger. In 2005, Kathleen Pamela married Jarrod Alan Cushing in a civil ceremony at the Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum in Rhode Island.[44]
In 1995, Iger married Willow Bay in an interfaith Jewish and Roman Catholic service in Bridgehampton, New York.[45] They have two children: Robert Maxwell "Max" Iger, and William Iger.
Iger co-chaired a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign on August 22, 2016.[46] Iger was named to President-elect Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum on December 2, 2016.[47] He resigned from Trump's cabinet on June 1, 2017 after Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement.[48]
Accolades and recognition[edit]
In June 2012, Steven Spielberg, founder of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, presented Iger with the Ambassador for Humanity Award, the Institute's highest honor. Iger was recognized for his support of the Institute’s work, his longtime philanthropy, and his leadership role in corporate citizenship.[49][50]
Iger was presented with The Milestone Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA) in 2014. The award is the PGA’s highest recognition for an individual or team who has made historic contributions to entertainment.[51]
In May 2015, Iger was named to the 25th Annual Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame. He was honored for his stewardship of the Walt Disney Company and his strategic vision focused on generating the best creative content possible, fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology, and expanding into new markets around the world.[25]
In October 2015, the Toy Industry Association (TIA) inducted Iger into the Toy Industry Hall of Fame. He was selected by members of TIA in recognition of his significant contributions to the industry, and the impact his work has had on the lives of children worldwide.[16]

Date of Birth: Feb 10, 1951
Nicknames: Robert A Iger, Bob Iger
Ethnicity: White, Jewish people
Country: United States of AmericaRobert Iger was born in California and has an estimated net worth of $60 million dollars. After beginning his media career as a weatherman, Robert Iger went on to become the current CEO of the Walt Disney Company.  He has overseen multiple important shifts in the Disney Company's direction, including their collaboration with Pixar and the acquisition of Marvel Entertainment. Bob Iger Salary  What is Bob Iger's annual salary? $28 million Robert A. "Bob" Iger (born February 10, 1951) is an American businessman and the current chairman and chief executive of The Walt Disney Company. He was named president of Disney in 2000, and later succeeded Michael Eisner as chief executive in 2005, after a successful effort by Roy E. Disney to shake-up the management of the company. Iger oversaw the acquisition of Pixar in 2006, following a period of strained relations with the animation studio. He also led the company to acquire Marvel Entertainment, further broadening the Disney company's character franchises, in 2009.Iger was born in Long Island, New York. His mother worked at Boardman Junior High School in Oceanside, New York and his father was executive vice president and general manager of the Greenvale Marketing Corporation, and a professor of advertising and public relations.Iger completed his undergraduate studies at Ithaca College where he graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television & Radio from Ithaca's Roy H.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
