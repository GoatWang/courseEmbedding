		Elite’s Cloudweb Inc (OTCBB:CLOW) Hits the OTC

Micro Cap Insider, Street Watch




Cloudweb Inc (OTCBB:CLOW) has skyrocketed up on significant volume after the stock was announced as the new pick from penny stock Godzilla promoter Elite Penny Stock Group.
APS Predecessor Elite Penny Stock Group operates the domains Finestpennystocks.com, Smartstockchoices.com, Bestamericanstocks.com and Elitepennystock.com, mysoaringpennystocks.com and pennystocks.com (which provides the APS connection as it was APS that bought pennystocks.com for US $1M back in the day)
Their last pick EURI spiked to incredible $2.09 highs before the stock was slapped with the dreaded Skull & Crossbones designation from OTCMarkets and the whole thing collapsed.
Cloudweb Inc (OTCBB:CLOW) bills itself as a technology provider to small businesses, Web design professionals and individuals, delivering cloud-based products and outcome-driven, personalized Customer Care. The Company operates domain marketplace, where its customers can find that piece of digital real estate that matches their idea.
CLOW provides Website building, hosting and security tools to help customers construct and protect their online presence and tackle the changing technology landscape. It also provides applications that help them connect to its customers, manage and grow their businesses and get found online. It has designed and developed a set of cloud-based technology products that enable its customers to establish a digital presence, connect with their customers and manage their business operations. The Company’s products include domain, hosting and presence, and business applications.

FinestPennyStocks announced CLOW as their pick ”CLOW is my 2016 red hot stock tip – are you ready to make 500% profits? As promised yesterday my red hot stock tip for February is: Company Name: Cloudweb Inc Ticker Symbol: CLOW
CLOW is going to be my hottest stock tip this year. I expect this stock to potentially go up as much as 1,000% in the next few weeks.
CLOW operates in the red hot internet cloud services industry and the sector is on fire. According to BVP, there are more than 30 public cloud companies trading at over a billion dollars each.
It is also one of the reasons why during Godaddy’s recent IPO its share price shot up to over 30 dollars valuing the company at over 5 billion dollars! Microsoft is trading at an all-time high with Nadella at its helm because he had the foresight to reposition the company to cloud computing and hosting (mostly) for businesses.
“Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer at Microsoft. Amazon also reached an all-time high recently in great part thanks to its array of web hosting services which have helped the stock outperform its peers.
Dropbox raised money at a valuation of 10 billion dollars recently. All these big companies are great but as you know there is no such thing as “one size fits all” which is why new-comers like CLOW can carve themselves a small piece of a gigantic pie.
CLOW focuses mainly on offering cloud services to companies in the UK and has already scored big by closing a contract with one of DHL’s biggest UK subsidiaries. The UK has more than 5 million businesses and every single one of them could use cloud services.
We have a Monster Pick Coming. Subscribe Right Now!
Currently racing up the charts CLOW has minimal assets or revenues and rising short term debt. But CLOW is the latest pick from Elite Penny Stock Group that just took EURI to $2.09 and AREN to $1.30 before that. We will be updating on CLOW when more details emerge so make sure you are subscribed to Microcapdaily so you know what’s going on with CLOW.
