In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

LendingRobot Launches Product That Connects With Lending Club

LendingRobot, the peer lending robo-advisor, announced on Thursday (Oct. 13) a new product connecting to the Lending Club platform, called LendingRobot For Advisors.
In a press release, LendingRobot said the new For Advisors product is built to merge the best of machine-based, high-speed investing with the supervision of registered investment advisors. Financial advisors can now manage all of their client accounts through a single unified dashboard, while leveraging LendingRobot’s algorithmic investment strategies and automated portfolio management. This new product is the result of a close collaboration between LendingRobot and Millennium Trust, which provides custodial services for financial advisors on the Lending Club platform.
“Our goal as a company has always been to empower individual investors in peer lending with the best tools to compete with the ‘big guys’ by automating everything from initial investments, to reinvesting cash returns, to pricing and selling on the secondary market,” said Emmanuel Marot, CEO of LendingRobot, in the press release. “Managing that process to maximize returns within even a single portfolio is a Herculean task. Today, if you are a financial advisor with 30 clients all interested in diversifying with peer lending, that task is next to impossible. Even the best chess players today are a team of two: a computer and a human. This is why we’ve created LendingRobot For Advisors — bringing together the expertise of human advisors with the automation and simplicity of our algorithms.”
LendingRobot For Advisors provides an opportunity to diversify investments, in part due to low interest rates and increasing worries about coming downturns in the stock market. Advisors who sign up for this new product simply create a parent account and then link accounts of clients under their supervision, the company said. Advisors are then able to create unique risk and investment profiles for each client, which, in turn, are managed by LendingRobot algorithms according to each preference. Results and reporting for any individual client, or as a unified dashboard across all client accounts, are available to the advisor. As a part of the strategic relationship with Millennium Trust, client assets remain secure in Millennium’s custody.

LendingRobot Gives Investors a “One Stop Solution” for Alternative Lending Investing
 Tweet4 Share4 Share1 +16 Reddit Pin EmailShares 15

April 6, 2017 @ 12:38 pm By JD Alois 


LendingRobot Says Strong Demand Takes Robo-fund Beyond Individual Investors
LendingRobot and its relatively new offering “LendingRobot Series“, has announced a product specifically for institutional investors labeled, “LendingRobot Professional”. The new Robo-fund for alternative lending was created “based on significant interest” from wealth managers and family offices. LendingRobot Series also becomes the first fund to be directly accessible to foreign investors. following potential clients in Europe or China inquiring about how to access this new US-based investment opportunity.
LendingRobot Professional is an advisor-focused service that adds functionality to LendingRobot’s fully automated solution for alternative lending. The new product is said to be optimized for multi-clients advisors enabling them to specify target risks and maturities for each individual client.
“The initial reaction to LendingRobot Series has been overwhelming to say the least,” said LendingRobot CEO, Emmanuel Marot. “The desire for a simple, diversified, flexible, and liquid solution to invest in alternative lending was always apparent to our company, but we had no idea so many investors were just biding their time for the right solution to come along.”
LendingRobot said the new service delivers the ability to deploy and monitor large pools of investor funds across multiple lending origination platforms with the same speed and simplicity as individuals. LendingRobot Professional also lowers the minimum investment for each investor under the umbrella of a fund or advisor account, as the $250,000 minimum can be met with a large pool of investors contributing only a portion of that amount.
Marot said his company has always been about allowing individuals the ability to compete alongside large institutions in the online lending investing sector.
“Now that our technology has matured and we have established the LendingRobot fund, there is no reason not to bring this offering to professionals as well with the promise that what we are offering actually provides a better solution than what currently exists for their needs,” said Marot.
Launched just two months ago LendingRobot Series has reportedly received a third of its current subscription limit, and over 800 investors signed up on the waiting list within a week of launch.
LendingRobot currently has 6500+ clients and over $120 million in assets under management.  Average net returns are holding at 9.2%.

LendingRobot Doubles Down on Lending Club Secondary Market, Launches “Adaptive Portfolio Rebalancing”



 



By PYMNTS  


Posted on June 7, 2016

      LendingRobot announced today a new robo-advisor product for Lending
      Club, called Adaptive Portfolio Rebalancing (AdPR). The new AdPR product
      is designed to improve investor returns on Lending Club by actively
      monitoring user portfolios and the secondary market in search of
      underperforming or underpriced loans, respectively. LendingRobot’s
      enhanced model, available only to investors with a minimum $20,000 under
      management, detects when it is possible to increase returns by
      offloading a note, or by seizing good opportunities on the secondary
      market. As with all LendingRobot products, the AdPR model is fully
      autonomous, without any need for user oversight or action once they
      opt-in.
    

      “Robo-advisors have largely been considered tools that perform two basic
      functions: create a properly diversified portfolio and reinvest new cash
      or income according to a static investment strategy, but we are capable
      of so much more,” said Emmanuel Marot, CEO of LendingRobot. “The real
      dream of these kinds of algorithmic solutions is a super-human financial
      advisor that monitors and takes advantage of every single opportunity to
      improve your returns 24 hours a day. With Adaptive Portfolio
      Rebalancing, we are taking a massive step in that direction.”
    

      LendingRobot clients who want to take advantage of Adaptive Portfolio
      Rebalancing simply need to check one or both of the boxes now available
      in the “Strategy” section of their dashboard. As long as LendingRobot is
      managing more than $20,000 for the client on Lending Club, AdPR will
      start as soon as that box is checked. For new users, AdPR features will
      be enabled when they sign up for LendingRobot and they can choose to
      opt-out. When creating a LendingRobot account, new users set their
      investment strategy using the simple “aggressive” to “conservative”
      slider and then check or uncheck the AdPR boxes below the slider. All
      AdPR activity will be matched to their overall investment strategy.
    

      “The U.S. Treasury whitepaper on marketplace lending underscored the
      need for an active and stable secondary market,” continued Mr. Marot.
      “We see this product not only as a way to maintain and accelerate that
      healthy secondary market, but also improve returns for investors that
      will be better able to capitalize on the increase in secondary market
      activity we’ve observed in recent weeks.”
    

      The AdPR product is fully transparent and notes bought on the primary or
      secondary market are clearly distinguished on the website, in the client
      dashboard, and in the daily email digest we send of all LendingRobot
      activity. Clients who do not wish to continue using AdPR can still
      opt-out of one or both of the AdPR functions. There is one checkbox to
      allow buying existing notes on the secondary market, and another to
      authorize trying to sell notes.
    

      Lending Club users or new investors to marketplace lending can sign up
      for LendingRobot at www.lendingrobot.com.
      LendingRobot is also the only service that provides a free mobile
      dashboard for iOS and Android that lets investors on Lending Club,
      Prosper, or FundingCircle to track and analyze their portfolio across
      one or all of those marketplaces. The LendingRobot Dashboard is
      available in the iOS App Store here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lendingrobot-dashboard/id1086703758?ls=1&mt=8
      and the Google Play store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lendingrobot.mobile.

Lending Robot Launches To Help Find & Fund Best Lending Club Deals
 Tweet7 Share Share5 +11 Reddit Pin EmailShares 13

December 18, 2013 @ 10:51 am By Charles Luzar 


The demand for investment opportunities on Lending Club may be outpacing the supply. Consider that some of the best loans on Lending Club are funded within 30 seconds of hitting the platform. It takes an extremely active lender to find and fund the best deals.
However, Lending Club has an API, and a new service aims to make use of that API to help combat the fact that the best deals are often funded faster than many lenders can find them. The service is called LendingRobot, “a provider of investment automation and data services for the rapidly growing peer lending market.”
LendingRobot founders discovered the most lucrative loans are funded very quickly, and even when dedicating significant time it is hard for individual investors to constantly reinvest their portfolios. LendingRobot evolved from efforts by the founders to automate their personal peer lending investments.
Now open to the general public, the LendingRobot service helps investors successfully fund those loans in highest demand and/or best meet their personal investment criteria. Users define what kind of loans they want to invest in using a simple yet powerful set of filters. Unique to LendingRobot, they can also define a cascading set of rules to invest simultaneously in different loans profiles. The cloud-based service then tirelessly works to invest and reinvest according to those filters.
Investors’ funds always remain in their Lending Club accounts and LendingRobot has no access to investor funds. LendingRobot provides a daily activity report and lets investors modify their investment criteria at any time. LendingRobot enables better investment selection, reduces the amount of time required and ensures idle cash is continuously reinvested.

The service has been in private beta since September and the team says it has been hailed as a great tool by early users. “LendingRobot makes investing in peer-to-peer loans easy and efficient. It allows me to find the exact loans I want without having to sort them manually. Great product!” says Brendan B., an early user. According to Don B., another early LendingRobot user, and Lending Club investor since 2008, “LendingRobot has changed my relation with Lending Club, in less than one week”.
LendingRobot, which exits beta today, charges a fee based on the investments successfully funded by the service. There are no set up or fixed costs.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
