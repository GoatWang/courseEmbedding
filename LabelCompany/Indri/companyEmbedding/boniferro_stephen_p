[wp_cart:Niacin SR:price:30.94:end]
 
 
Mega Omega – is an ultra-pure fish oil sourced from Norway. This highly concentrated natural oil provides 780 mg of omega-3 essential fatty acids per softgel. To assure maximum pureness and freshness, the oil is stabilized with vitamin E (as mixed tocopherols), is molecularly distilled, and is independently verified to be free of PCBs, heavy metals, and pesticides. EPA and DHA from fish oil promotecardiovascular health by supporting the maintenance of triglyceride and cholesterol levels already within the normal range, and by supporting healthy platelet aggregation. Fish oil has also been shown to support joint tissue health and healthy brain and nervous system function. The enteric-coated softgels support compliance and absorption.*
$49.15
[wp_cart:Mega Omega:price:49.15:end]
 
 
Flora Force – is a vegetarian, dairy- and gluten-free, four-strain probiotic totaling 30 billion CFU† per capsule. Each vegetarian capsule is sealed in nitrogen-purged aluminum blister packs to serve as protection from factors proven to compromise stability of probiotics such as heat, moisture, and oxygen.

        Combination Products and Sponsor-Investigator IDE Studies Stephen P. Rhodes Product Jurisdiction Officer Director, IDE and HDE Programs Center for Devices and Radiological Health University of Miami Human Subjects Research Office (HSRO) Conference October 24, 2008







2

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20082 Combination Products - Background Combination products statutorily recognized in Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 Required assignment to lead center based on primary mode of action Implemented by Chief Mediator and Ombudsman







3

4

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20084 OCP – Common Questions OCP answers four questions about products: 1. Type of product 2. Lead reviewing Center 3. The review process 4. Minimize review times







5

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20085 Where is OCP? Commissioners Office Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Center for Devices and Radiological Health Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Office of Combination Products







6

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20086 Definition of a Drug The term "drug" means: (A) articles recognized in the US Pharmacopoeia, Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, or National Formulary; (B) articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals; (C) articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.







7

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20087 Definition of a Device Instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is - (3) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body and which does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within or on the body and which is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.







8

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20088 Definition of a Biological Product – Virus – Therapeutic Serum – Toxin or Antitoxin – Vaccine – Blood, Blood Component or Derivative – Allergenic Product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of diseases or injuries of man







9

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 20089 What is a Combination Product? Combinations of different types of products: –Drug-device –Device-biologic –Drug-biologic –Drug-device-biologic –NOT drug-drug, device-device or biologic-biologic combinations They can be: –Physically or chemically combined –Co-packaged in a kit –Separate, cross-labeled products







10

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200810 Examples of Combination Products Drug-eluting coronary stent Controlled-release drug delivery implant Spinal fusion cage with growth factor Chemotherapy drug and monoclonal antibody Wound scaffold seeded with autologous cells Interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis C Assay/drug pairing







11

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200811 You have a combination product







12

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200812 Primary Mode of Action (PMOA) Primary mode of action is the statutory criterion FDA must use to determine the agency component with primary jurisdiction for the review and regulation of a combination product. 21 U.S.C. § 503(g)







13

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200813 PMOA, continued PMOA not defined in statute, now defined in regulations: 21 CFR 3.2(k) and (m). Final Rule issued on August 25, 2005 and can be accessed at: http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/05- 16527.htm http://www.fda.gov/OHRMS/DOCKETS/98fr/05- 16527.htm







14

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200814 Mode of Action Mode of Action: the means by which a product achieves an intended therapeutic effect or action. 21 CFR 3.2(k) Three types of modes of action: biological product, device, drug Combination products typically have more than one identifiable mode of action







15

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200815 Primary Mode of Action Primary mode of action is the single mode of action of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The most important therapeutic action is the mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall intended therapeutic effects of the combination product. 21 CFR 3.2(m)







16

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200816 PMOA algorithm If unable to determine most important therapeutic action with reasonable certainty, consider: –Consistency: is there an agency component that regulates other combination products presenting similar questions of S & E with regard to combination product as a whole? –Safety and Effectiveness: which agency component has the most expertise related to most significant S&E questions presented by combination product?







17

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200817 PMOA - CDER or CDRH?







18

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200818 Request for Designation (RFD) Voluntary Formal Process 21 CFR Part 3 Classification (what am I?) Assignment (where do I go?) Clarification of Regulatory Pathway (what do I do when I get there?)







19

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200819 RFD Content Sponsor information Product description Proposed use and indications Description of primary mode of action Recommendation on product classification and Center with primary jurisdiction 21 CFR §3.7 (c) Also, see Guidance Document on How to Write a Request for Designation at http://www.fda.gov/oc/combination/howtowrite.html







20

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200820 The Future Numbers and Types of Combination Products Will Continue to Grow Consultation Process More Systemized Clearer, More Predictable Process for Assignment, Premarket Review, and Postmarket Regulation







21

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200821 Section 520(g) of the FD&C Act Purpose of an IDE To encourage discovery and development of useful medical devices for human use, to the extent consistent with the protection of the public health and safety and with ethical standards, while maintaining optimum freedom for scientific investigators in their pursuit of that purpose







22

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200822 Purpose of an IDE An approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) allows: an investigational device to be used in a clinical study in order to collect S&E data required to support a Premarket Approval (PMA) application, a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE), or a Premarket Notification [510(k)] submission to FDA. a device to be shipped lawfully for the purpose of conducting investigations







23

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200823 Provisions of the IDE Regulation All clinical investigations subject to the regulation must be approved before they can begin Assigns responsibilities to all participants in clinical investigation All subjects in the investigation must give informed consent







24

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200824 Definitions Investigational Device –Is still in the developmental stage –Object of a clinical investigation is to determine safety and efficacy –Is not considered to be in commercial distribution Investigational Use –Clinical evaluation of an already legally marketed device for a new intended use







25

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200825 Studies Subject to the Regulation To support marketing application [PMA, HDE or 510(k)] Collection of safety and effectiveness information (e.g., for a new intended use of a legally marketed device) Sponsor-investigator studies of unapproved devices or new intended use of approved device (even if no marketing application planned)







26

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200826 Studies Exempt from need for IDE Preamendments (pre-1976) devices 510(k)-cleared or PMA-approved devices, if used in accordance with approved labeling In vitro diagnostic devices (most of the time) Consumer preference testing Combinations of legally marketed devices Custom devices (NARROWLY defined)







27

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200827 “ Practice of Medicine ” “Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or interfere with the authority of a health care practitioner to prescribe or administer any legally marketed device to a patient for any condition or disease within a legitimate health care practitioner- patient relationship….”







28

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200828 “Practice of Medicine” Physician should: –Be well informed about the product –Use firm scientific rationale and sound medical evidence –Maintain records on use and effects IDE not req’d; Institution may require IRB review/approval and IC Other prohibitions still apply







29

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200829 “Basic Physiological Research” Investigating a physiological principle No intent to develop the device for marketing Only using the device to address the research question  No IDE needed; IRB approval and IC should be obtained







30

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200830 If NOT Exempt from Device Regulation, Then… Need to assess whether proposed study of device is considered SIGNIFICANT RISK (SR), or NONSIGNIFICANT RISK (NSR) IRBs can and do make this assessment most of the time FDA can assist IRBs and/or investigators by making risk determinations; this determination is final See IRB Information Sheet on SR/NSR: http://www.fda.gov/oc/ohrt/irbs/devices.html#risk







31

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200831 Significant Risk (SR) Study Presents a potential serious risk to the health, safety, and welfare of a subject and is: –an implant; or –used in supporting or sustaining human life; or –of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or preventing impairment of human health







32

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200832 Significant Risk (SR) Study Examples Evaluation of a marketed biliary stent for use in the peripheral vasculature Evaluation of unapproved radiofrequency ablation device for treatment of primary hepatic neoplasia







33

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200833 Significant Risk IDEs Sponsor submits IDE application to FDA FDA approves, conditionally approves or disapproves IDE within 30 calender days Sponsor obtains IRB approval After both FDA and IRB approve the investigation, study can begin







34

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200834 Non-significant Risk IDEs Sponsor presents protocol to IRB and a statement why investigation does not pose significant risk If IRB approves the investigation as NSR, it can begin Abbreviated IDE requirements (labeling, IRB, consent, monitoring, reporting, prohibition on promotion) No IDE submission to FDA needed







35

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200835 Non-significant Risk Study Examples Most functional MRI studies Study of non-invasive blood pressure measuring device Electroencephalography studies Studies of wound dressings Contact lens studies Studies of conventional laparoscopes







36

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200836 Study Determination Inquiries If an IRB is uncertain whether a study is exempt, significant risk or nonsignficant risk, FDA will make a determination E-mail me a draft or outline of the study and a clear description of the devices FDAs will issue a letter; the determination is final







37

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200837 What do ALL clinical studies of unapproved or investigational medical devices conducted in U.S. have in common? Same basic applicable regulations REGARDLESS of whether sponsor is a manufacturer or clinical investigator







38

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200838 Applicable Regulations 21 CFR Part 50: Informed Consent, Human Subject Protections 21 CFR Part 54: Financial Disclosure 21 CFR Part 56: Institutional Review Boards 21 CFR Part 812: Investigational Device Exemptions







39

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200839 Sponsor-Investigator Studies May be done to answer a scientific question not of interest to manufacturer “Right of Reference” from company may be needed for supporting preclinical data and manufacturing information If not intended to support a marketing application, may not need to be as statistically robust Sponsor-Investigators are responsible for ALL requirements of Sponsors and Investigators







40

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200840 SPONSOR Responsibilities Ultimately LEGALLY responsible for: –IRB approval –Conduct and monitoring of study –Reporting to IRB and FDA (initial, continuing, final, unexpected AEs, study suspension, device recall, emergency use, IRB withdrawal, etc.) –Device disposition –Investigator agreements –Informing other investigators as needed –Adequate record-keeping –Labeling –Prohibition of promotion/marketing







41

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200841 “A sponsor is responsible for assuring, through personal contact between the monitor and each investigator, that the investigator clearly understands and accepts the obligations incurred in undertaking a clinical investigation.” Monitoring Guidance: http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/bimo/clin guid.html http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/bimo/clin guid.html







42

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200842 Significant Risk IDEs Sponsor submits application to FDA FDA approves, conditionally approves or disapproves IDE within 30 calender days Sponsor obtains IRB approval After both FDA and IRB approve the investigation, study can begin







43

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200843 Different Types of IDEs Feasibility Study, Single Center Pivotal Study, Multi-Center Randomized vs. Non-Randomized Double Blind vs. Single Blind vs. Unblinded Concurrent Control vs. Historical Control Sponsor-Investigator Open-Label, Single Center Treatment Use, Multi-Center Continued Access, Multi-Center Emergency/Compassionate Use, Single Center







44

        University of Miami HSRO October 24, 200844 Required Elements of an IDE U.S. Sponsor (manufacturer or investigator) Report of Prior Investigations Investigational Plan Manufacturing Information Investigator and IRB Information Sales Information Labeling Informed Consent

        Investigator responsibilities Conduct the research in compliance with the signed agreement with the sponsor, the investigational plan, applicable regulations, and any conditions imposed by reviewing IRB or FDA Supervise all testing of the device on human subjects Ensure requirements for obtaining IC are met Use investigational device only with subjects under investigator’s supervision and supply investigational device only to persons authorized to receive them







46

        Investigator responsibilities (continued) Return any remaining devices to sponsor or dispose of them as sponsor directs after the completion/termination of the investigation or the investigator’s part in the investigation Maintain accurate/complete/current records related to participation in investigation, including all correspondence, receipt/use/disposition of device, each subject’s case history and exposure to the device, protocol with records related to any deviations, and any other records required by regulations or specific requirement







47

        Investigator responsibilities (continued) Permit FDA to inspect/copy any records related to research Prepare/ submit to sponsor and, when required by regulation, reviewing IRB and monitor, complete/accurate/timely reports, including reports on unanticipated device effects, progress, deviation from investigational plan, any use of device without informed consent, a final report, and any additional information requested by FDA or IRB about any aspect of the investigation







48

        Supervision of a Clinical Investigation In a clinical investigation, the investigator commits to conduct and/or supervise the process personally. The investigator who delegates tasks related to the research is responsible for providing adequate supervision to whomever the task is delegated and is accountable for regulatory violations caused from failure to supervise the conduct of the study.







49

        FDA Assessment of Adequacy of Supervision of a Clinical Investigation FDA will focus on four major issues: 1) Were delegated individuals qualified to perform the tasks? 2) Did study staff receive adequate training on doing delegated tasks and did they have an adequate understanding of the study? 3)Was there adequate supervision/involvement in ongoing conduct of the study? 4) Was there adequate supervision/oversight of any third parties involved in conduct of a study (to the extent such supervision/oversight reasonably possible)?







50

        Protecting the Rights,Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects 1. Reasonable Medical Care Necessitated by Research Participation Investigator should ensure adequate care provided for any adverse events Investigator should inform subject’s primary physician about participation in research if subject has primary physician and agrees to such notification Investigator should make every effort to obtain appropriate care, if investigator does not possess necessary skills 2. Reasonable Access to Medical Care Investigator should be readily available to subjects during conduct of trial Availability important where subjects receiving intervention with significant toxicity or abuse potential If investigator unavailable, responsibility for subjects should be delegated to a specific qualified person readily available to subjects







51

        Protecting the Rights,Safety, and Welfare of Study Subjects (Cont’d) 3. Protocol violations that Present Unreasonable Risks Situation where failure to follow protocol may be considered a failure to protect rights, safety, and welfare of subjects Failure to follow inclusion’/exclusion criteria specifically intended to exclude subjects for whom study intervention poses unreasonable risks Failure to perform safety assessments intended to detect toxicity/adverse events within protocol-specified time frames Investigators should seek to minimize risks by adhering close to study protocol

Title
A Methodology for Strategically Designing Physical Products that are Naturally Resistant to Reverse Engineering



Author
Stephen P. Harston, Brigham Young University - ProvoFollow



Abstract
Reverse engineering - defined as extracting information about a product from the product itself - is a design tactic commonly used in industry from competitive benchmarking to product imitation. While reverse engineering is a legitimate practice - as long as the product was legally obtained - innovative products are often reverse engineered at the expense of the pioneering company. However, by designing products with built-in barriers to reverse engineering, competitors are no longer able to effectively extract critical information from the product of interest. Enabling the quantification of barriers to reverse engineering, this dissertation presents a set of metrics and parameters that can be used to calculate the barrier to reverse engineer any product as well as the time required to do so. To the original designer, these numerical representations of the barrier and time can be used to strategically identify and improve product characteristics so as to increase the difficulty and time to reverse engineer them. On the other hand, these quantitative measures enable competitors who reverse engineer original designs to focus their efforts on products that will result in the greatest return on investment. In addition to metrics that estimate the reverse engineering barrier and time, this dissertation also presents a methodology to strategically plan for, select, design, and implement reverse engineering barriers. The methodology presented herein considers barrier development cost, barrier effectiveness in various product components, impact on performance, and return on investment. This process includes sensitivity analysis, modeling of the return on investment, and exploration of multiobjective design spaces. The effectiveness of the presented methodology is demonstrated by making a solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicle difficult to reverse engineer. In the example, the propeller is selected to be the critical component where a series of voids are introduced to decrease the propeller weight and increase the flutter speed (a desirable attribute in propellers). Our tenet is that the use of such a framework contributes greatly to the sustainability of technological, economical, and security advantages enjoyed by those who developed the technology. Designers benefit because (i) products do not readily disclose trade secrets, (ii) competitive advantages can be maintained by impeding competitors from reverse engineering and imitating innovative products, and (iii) the return on investment can be increased.
