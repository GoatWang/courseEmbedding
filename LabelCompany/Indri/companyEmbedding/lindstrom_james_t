Kilopass Names Semiconductor Industry Veteran James T. Lindstrom CFO



Lindstrom Brings Kilopass 30 Years of High-Tech Finance Experience
Spanning Multinational Public Companies to High Tech Start-Ups
Santa Clara, Calif. – January 24, 2012 – Kilopass Technology Inc., a leading provider of semiconductor logic non-volatile memory (NVM) intellectual property (IP), today named James T. Lindstrom as the company’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  His 30-years in high-tech corporate finance will help accelerate Kilopass’ growth into a high-valuation semiconductor company. He began his career in international finance at Fairchild Semiconductor and has driven the development and financing of many Silicon Valley companies, including:  Cadence, C-Cube Microsystems, FormFactor, Trident Microsystems and eSilicon.
“Jim will make an invaluable contribution to the Kilopass executive management team,” said Charlie Cheng, president and CEO of Kilopass Technology Inc. “I know this from personal experience as he was my CFO directing financial operations and fund raising for Lexra, Inc. when I was CEO. Jim is incredibly well versed in the semiconductor industry having begun his career with Fairchild Semiconductor handling their U.S. and International financial operations. I couldn’t have asked for a better replacement for Cory Sindelar, who contributed significantly to setting Kilopass up for its next phase of growth, but is moving on to another opportunity.  We wish him well.”
James T. Lindstrom led the IPOs of ECAD and Trident Microsystems and has an extensive understanding of mergers and acquisitions having played an integral role in the formation of Cadence Design Systems from ECAD and SDA Systems and the acquisition of Silicon Perspective by Cadence.
“It’s great to be working with Charlie once again,” said Lindstrom. “He’s has leveraged his broad experience acquired at Faraday and U.S. Venture Partners to direct Kilopass onto the path of growth and expansion that attracted me to this opportunity. I see a great future for Kilopass and I’m anxious to make my contribution to its success.  Kilopass has a sound financial structure enabling Kilopass to grow in tough economic times. I will build on this structure to drive the company to its next level of expansion.”
Lindstrom is currently a member of the board of directors of Semtech Corporation serving on the company’s audit committee and nominating and governance committee. He is a graduate of U.C. Berkeley and holds an MBA in Finance and Business Economics from the University of Southern California. He lives with his family in Sunol, California.
