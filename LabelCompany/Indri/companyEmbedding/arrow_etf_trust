Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.


          Research is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute advice or guidance, nor is it an endorsement or recommendation for any particular security or trading strategy. Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.
	
    

For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.

Strategic Advisers, Inc., is the investment manager for client accounts and implements trades for the accounts based on the model portfolio of investments it receives from BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Strategic Advisers may select investments for an account that differ from BlackRock Investment Management's model.


BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio is a service offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.


Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and Members of NYSE and SIPC.

Offer Rules:


         
	
	
	       This offer is valid for new or existing Fidelity customers. In order to receive the commission-free trades, you must designate an existing eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account or open and fund a new eligible Fidelity IRA or brokerage account with net new assets. Deposits of $50,000-$99,999 will receive 300 free trades, and deposits of $100,000 or more will receive 500 free trades. Trades must be used within 2 years of being credited to the customer’s account. Commission-free trades must be designated to the one account receiving the qualifying assets or amount and are limited to online domestic equities and options trades. Options trades are limited to 20 contracts or less per trade; for orders beyond these limitations, standard commission rates apply. No cash compensation will be given for any unused commission-free trades. Offer is nontransferable, limited to one per individual per rolling 12 months and may not be combined with other offers. Fidelity reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions or terminate this offer at any time. Other terms and conditions, or eligibility criteria may apply.

New accounts or designated eligible accounts must be funded within 60 days ("qualification period"). Cash, eligible securities, and/or margin debit balance transfers from multiple sources will be aggregated to determine total account funding; assets will be valued at the time Fidelity receives them. Allow up to seven business days for assets to be registered in the system. Funding must come from an external, non-Fidelity source via any standard monetary transfer method (a standard Transfer of Assets form, check, Electronic Funds Transfer, ADM deposit, etc.); rollovers from a former employer’s Fidelity record kept workplace savings plan are treated as coming from an external source for purposes of this offer. Net new assets mean external new money in minus money out, including distributions and transfers, during the qualification period.

Offer is not valid for non-U.S. residents; persons employed by FINRA or a securities organization in a regulatory capacity; employees of Fidelity, its affiliates, and members of their immediate families and households, or the media who cover financial services. Certain states and local jurisdictions have laws that limit or restrict public employees from accepting items of value from vendors such as Fidelity that provide services to public institutions. Some public entities such as governments, state universities, health care organizations, etc., also have internal policies that may contain similar restrictions. If you are a public official or employee, you should determine if one of these laws or internal policies applies to you. By accepting this incentive, we assume that you are in compliance with your jurisdiction’s laws and institution’s internal policies.

What is an ETF?



The simplest definition of an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is that it's an investment that's built like a mutual fund but trades like an individual stock.The most common ETFs are designed to track the performance of a market benchmark, or "index."

Enjoy the same built-in benefits of mutual funds








Diversification
One fund can hold potentially hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual stocks and bonds, which helps spread out risk.
 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every single investment your ETF owns. The fund is managed by fund experts who take care of that for you.
 

Get more control with ETFs—at lower costs








While ETFs are in many ways the same as mutual funds, there are some features that make them unique.Trading flexibility
ETFs offer you the same intraday pricing you get when trading stocks and bonds through a broker on a major stock exchange.Lower cost
Funds that track an index, like ETFs and index mutual funds, generally offer lower expense ratios than conventional mutual funds.Tax savings
Like index mutual funds, ETFs are typically more tax-efficient, which could translate into tax savings for you.Lower minimums
You can buy an ETF for as low as the cost of one share—giving you the opportunity to start investing in a diversified investment with less money.

Educational MaterialsSelect an educational pieceA Look at YieldAbsolute ReturnsAlpha Beta SoupAlternative AssetsAmnesia EffectAsset Class HistoryAsset Class SeasonalityBetas On The CuspBroken IncomeCommoditiesCommodity TurnsCorrelationDuration DilemmaEndowment AllocationFlood InsuranceInflationInvestor BehaviorInvestor ReturnsManaged FuturesMarket TurnsPanic P/EsPortfolio ChemistryRelative StrengthRelative Strength EnvironmentsRelative Strength TurnsRisk ManagementScare MarketsTactical BetaTactical DiversificationThe New 60/40 Three Legged StoolValue and MomentumVolatility & DiversificationTitleDescriptionPDFA Look at YieldThis piece provides an introduction to yield and how the low-rate environment has led investors to search globally for new sources of income. It illustrates the importance of dividends as part of an investment's total return. It also discusses common methods of calculating yield, points out the differences in the calculations, and stresses the importance of making an "apples-to-apples" comparison.Absolute ReturnsIllustrates how employing absolute return strategies may provide investors with an inflationary hedge and reduce or avoid the negative compounding effect.Alpha Beta SoupSmart beta is the bridge between the active and passive management. Active managers try to improve performance attributes (alpha) and passive strategies try to deliver performance consistent with a specific category or asset class (beta). This piece discusses both approaches, and highlights the middle ground that may be found by using a factor-based smart beta approach.Alternative AssetsDiscusses why integrating alternatives into a traditional portfolio should help reduce portfolio volatility and improve the odds of preserving capital over the long term.Amnesia EffectDiscusses the failed behavior of fear-based market timing and performance chasing, instead of remembering the potential value of diversification, including constant exposure to noncorrelated investments such as managed futures.Asset Class HistoryA look at the calendar year performance history of various asset classes during the past two decades. In its entirety, this colorful table provides a clear view that asset classes go in and out of favor from year to year, making a powerful case for the potential benefits of diversification.Asset Class SeasonalityStudying asset class seasonality helps to address the old adage of “Sell in May and go away.” The piece examines if there is statistical truth to the yearly superstition with regard to the stock market and if it also applies to other asset classes. Hopefully, as case is made for the potential value of diversification and long-term investment horizons in an attempt to overcome short-term swings and anecdotal observations.Betas On The CuspStudies the increasing beta of various asset classes relative to the stock market on the cusp of a credit crisis. And considers taking a Minsky Approach to Modern Portfolio Theory through the use of alternative investments.Broken IncomeOwning a bond fund is not the same as owning a bond. This piece explains the inherent structural problem with many bond funds and makes a case for using absolute return funds as a possible alternative for portfolio diversification.CommoditiesA basic introduction to commodity investing. Analyzes some of the indexes commonly used as benchmarks for mutual funds, including a comparison of holdings, investment methodology and performance.Commodity TurnsLike any investment, commodities have historically gone in and out of favor. When they are in a prolonged period of delivering negative returns, at some point investors begin to wonder when they may begin to make a new upward turn. This piece looks at the historical returns of multiple asset classes and identifies previous times when commodities rebounded from low points and turned sharply upward.  Contango and CashThis article discusses commodity investing and some technical terms such as contango, backwardation and the use of futures contracts. It also addresses the idea of using a strategy that is more aligned with the objectives of long-term investors.CorrelationThis piece explains correlation and why it is such an important element for diversification. It also provides some perspective on historical correlations, specifically the difference between long-term and short-term averages.Duration DilemmaWhen interest rates rise, bond values generally fall. In order to address interest rate sensitivity in a low rate environment, many investors will reducing the average duration of their bond portfolios by moving to shorter maturities. However, reducing the duration of a bond portfolio in such a low rate environment often results in an lower portfolio yield. One potential solution is to consider using other sources of yield outside of traditional bonds where duration and maturity are not factors.Endowment AllocationThis educational piece discusses the asset allocation strategy of sophisticated endowment funds like Harvard and Yale.Flood InsuranceManaged futures strategies can go in and out of favor, but generally tend to attract the most assets after there is a sharp decline in the stock market. There is an argument to be made for using a strategy that work in both bull and bear markets. This piece examines the similarity between assets flowing into managed futures after a market correction versus people buying insurance after a flood.InflationThis piece explains the history of inflation, a commonly used statistical measurement for rising prices. It also provides some perspective on the way inflation affects an investor's portfolio, and how adding commodities may act as a hedge.Investor BehaviorShows how asset allocation strategies can be used to help limit losses caused by fear-based selling.Investor ReturnsThis piece explains the performance gap between an investor's actual returns from published total returns due to poor attempts at market timing. By measuring asset flows, it is possible to estimate how investors, on average, faired with their sales and purchasing decisions. Investor returns illustrates in real terms how greed and fear can influence decision making.Managed FuturesAn introduction to managed futures, including a history of the global futures markets and the potential diversification benefits of adding managed futures strategies to a portfolio of traditional assets.Market TurnsA historical look at how markets have acted during dramatic market upturns and downturns, and the resulting performance in the years that followed.Panic P/EsLooks at P/E ratios of stocks during market panic periods as a possible way of analyzing historical market turning points. By studying history, perhaps we can learn how the market adjusts prices during times of crisis and prepares for potential rebounds.Portable SigmaWhen seeking diversification, investors often favor using low risk investments to offset the higher volatility of stock-centric portfolios. Because of the lower volatility, the low risk investments require a greater allocation percentage in order to achieve the desired level of diversification for a portfolio. The idea of Portable Alpha is to use a lower percentage of higher volatility diversifiers, provided they have low correlation, in order to free up some capital for additional investments.Portfolio ChemistryCommodities have a historically been viewed as a fairly risky asset class, not unlike equities. Some investors avoid the asset class because of the historical volatility. Similar to high school chemistry, this piece discusses the concept of combining two risky asset classes, commodities and equities, to actually reduce overall portfolio volatility.Relative StrengthAn introduction to relative strength investing which includes information about the basic premise supporting the theory, as well as the actual practice of portfolio construction.Relative Strength EnvironmentsAn analysis of the sectors within the S&P 500 from a correlation perspective. The piece discusses the pre- and post-financial crisis periods and illustrates a timeline of events that may have created a challenging environment for trend-following strategies.Relative Strength TurnsExplains the cyclical nature of relative strength investment models by illustrating the historical performance compared to the overall equity market (S&P 500). Discusses the potential for relative strength to outperform (known as “RS Alpha”), but often does so with upward and downward trend periods.Risk ManagementThis piece explains standard deviation, a commonly used statistical measurement for risk. It also provides some perspective on the historical price movements of stocks and bonds relative to investors' risk tolerance.Scare MarketsMany investors have difficulty identifying the difference between a temporary market correction and a long-term bear market. This piece breaks down the basic differences to help investors make their own determination if a market decline seems like a long-term problem or just part of a normal market cycle.  Tactical BetaDiscusses the potential benefits of tactical investment strategies by increasing and reducing exposure to various asset classes at different times in an attempt to enhance potential returns and reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations.Tactical DiversificationTactical investment strategies and diversification are two terms that often seem contradictory, but may actually complement one another when added to a portfolio.The New 60/40In order to account for ever-changing risk environments, portfolio modeling should include a tactical element, which can add an extra level of diversification. Rather than relying on a static 60%/40% allocation to stocks and bonds, "The New 60/40" asks investors to consider blending a 60/40 mix of traditional assets with tactical and alternative strategies.Three Legged StoolThis Dorsey Wright Insights illustrates a portfolio management strategy known as The Three Legged Stool which combines a core portfolio of tactical and alternative mutual funds with three active management strategies.Value and MomentumMany investors believe that the way to diversify a value-based strategy is to add a growth strategy. However, growth can contradict value. Adding growth has the risk of reducing the effectiveness of a value strategy in the first place. This piece makes the case for using a momentum strategy, such as relative strength, to complement value.Volatility & DiversificationThe purpose of diversification is generally to improve the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio. Many investors believe the only way to reduce a portfolio’s risk is to add investments with less volatility, often at the cost of less return. But according to Modern Portfolio Theory, it may be possible to combine higher volatility investments to reduce a portfolio’s overall risk without sacrificing the potential for greater returns.

Multiple Global Macro StrategiesWith fewer constraints, Global Macro strategies are able to pursue a targeted investing style. The goal of the Fund is to systematically identify and provide exposure to leading global market strategies.

ETFs typically provide exposure to different market segments by investing in a diverse "basket" of stocks, bonds, or commodities. ETFs are listed and traded on U.S. stock exchanges. Simply put, they trade like stocks and act like index funds.Like stocks, ETFs are:                       Like mutual funds, ETFs are: Liquid  Flexible Easy to trade Baskets of securities or instruments Representative of different asset classes and investing stylesLike index funds, they provide:    Unlike mutual funds, ETFs are not: Diversification Market tracking Low Expenses Subject to a manager's impact Subject to style driftETF's are subject to risks similar to those of stocks and may not be suitable for all investors. ETF values will fluctuate and their price or value may rise or fall. Accordingly, an investor may receive back less than originally invested.

Northern Lights is a shared fund trust designed to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs)
to market, with operational
and cost efficiencies for advisers. The trust will provide
benefits to advisers similar to Gemini’s shared fund trusts for mutual funds. It
comprises independent ETFs managed by separate investment advisers. Like Gemini’s
shared mutual fund trusts, the Northern Lights Trust will provide ETF advisers
with operational efficiencies and economies of scale they would not be able to
achieve on their own. “The Northern Lights ETF
Trust will provide advisers with a complete suite of tools and support to
overcome obstacles to market entry and bring their ETFs to investors,” said Andrew
Rogers, chief executive of Gemini.Gemini and Arrow will
partner with other advisers to create additional ETFs within Northern Lights.Gemini Fund Services is an asset management firm specializing in tactical and
alternative investments. Arrow Investment Advisors is the adviser to Arrow
Funds and ArrowShares.

*Holdings are subject to change. Holdings and percent of assets are based on security assets only, not including cash or receivables (unpaid interest and dividends).¹Bid/Ask Midpoint as of market close. 
²SEC Yield and Distribution Rate calculations are based on most recent Ex-Date. Distribution Rate reflects the total distributions over the previous 12 months. SEC Yield and Distribution Rate may include income, dividends, return of capital, or other  distributions that are not considered short-term or long-term capital gains. Return of capital is considered a return of the investment principal and is not derived from net profits.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance data quoted here represents past performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
ArrowShares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. ET when NAV is normally determined for most ArrowShares, and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

*Periods under 1 year are not annualized ¹Bid/Ask Midpoint as of market close. ²Reflects partial calendar year 5/8/2012-12/31/2012.³"Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses" reflect the fund's pro rata share of the indirect fees and expenses incurred by investing in one or more acquired funds, such as mutual funds, business development companies, or other pooled investment vehicles. Acquired fund fees and expenses are reflected in the prices of the acquired funds and thus included in the total returns of the fund. 
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance data quoted here represents past performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted above. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
ArrowShares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Index returns are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual fund performance. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in an index. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Total returns for the periods since inception are calculated from the inception date of the fund. "Average annualized total returns" represent the average annual change in value of an investment over the period indicated. "Cumulative total returns" represent the total change in value of an investment over the periods indicated. Market returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 p.m. ET when NAV is normally determined for most ArrowShares, and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

Export historical NAV/Market Price










*Bid/Ask Midpoint as of market close. NAV and Market Price are usually calculated at 4:00 p.m. ET. Please refer to the ArrowShare's prospectus for more details on NAV determination. Description The above chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the ArrowShare and the ArrowShare's net asset value. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the ArrowShare's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 p.m. ET). The vertical axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed as a percentage of NAV. The horizontal axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the ArrowShare traded within the premium/discount range indicated. Although market makers will generally take advantage of differences between the NAV and the trading price of ArrowShare shares through arbitrage opportunities, there is no guarantee that they will do so. Why is there a difference between NAV and Market Price? A major reason for the difference is that timing discrepancies can exist between the NAV and Market Price (Bid/Ask Midpoint) reported above. Information is constantly flowing to and among investors, corporations, and financial institutions that affects their outlook on the financial markets and the value of securities. This process, known as price discovery, is why market prices change and evolve throughout the trading day. It is important to note that even when markets are closed, the price discovery process continues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Possible Timing Discrepancies: 

Close of Trading Times: The NAV of the ArrowShares normally is calculated using prices as of 4:00 p.m. ET. Each ArrowShare normally trades on its respective stock exchange until 4:00 p.m. ET.
Time of Last Trade: Trading generally takes place throughout the normal trading hours for ArrowShares on the listing exchange on which it is listed (generally 9:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m. ET). At times, many trades are placed in rapid succession. At other times, little or no trading activity is taking place. It is important to note that the date/time of the last trade (which is recorded as the Closing Price) may not take place at exactly 4:00 p.m. ET when the ArrowShares normally calculate NAV. The date/time of the last trade sometimes may occur before 4:00 p.m. ET. Thus, ongoing price discovery may result in a deviation between the price recorded as the Closing Price and the NAV of the ArrowShare shares calculated at 4:00 p.m. ET. Therefore ArrowShares generally reports market price as the bid/ask midpoint at or near market close.

Northern Lights Distributors, LLC is an unaffiliated entity from Arrow Investment Advisors, LLC.Arrow Dow Jones Global Yield ETF may not be suitable for all investors. The fund is new and has a limited performance record. The fund may not replicate the exact performance of the benchmark because of fees, expenses, trading costs and portfolio tracking error. Exchange traded products are bought and sold at market price, not NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Buying and selling shares generally results in brokerage commissions, which will reduce returns. Fixed income securities may be subject to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. International investments may involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, currency fluctuation, differences in generally accepted accounting principles, economic differences and political instability. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Changes in laws, domestically or abroad, could result in the inability of the fund to operate as described in the prospectus. Narrowly focused investments may be subject to higher volatility. High-yielding stocks and non-investment grade bonds are often higher-risk investments, which may be subject to greater volatility due to such factors as corporate developments, interest rate sensitivity, negative perceptions whether factual or not, and adverse economic conditions. Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) and Royalty Investment Trusts (RITs) have specific risks, including, among others, limited voting rights, energy demand, limited call rights of the general partner and changes in tax laws. In order to qualify for the tax treatment of a regulated investment company (RIC), the fund's exposure to MLPs cannot exceed 25%, or the fund may be subject to corporate tax status, which would reduce the overall performance. Investments in securities of real estate companies involve risks, including, among others, adverse changes in national, state or local real estate conditions domestically or abroad; obsolescence of properties; changes in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage funds; and the impact of changes in environmental or tax laws.The Dow Jones Global Composite Yield Indexsm is a product of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC ("SPDJI"), and has been licensed for use by Arrow Investment Advisors, LLC ("AIA"). Standard & Poor's® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("S&P"); Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC ("Dow Jones"); "Dow Jones", Dow Jones Global Composite Yield Indexsm and "Dow Jones Indexes" are trademarks of the Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC; and these trademarks have been licensed for use by SPDJI and sublicensed for certain purposes by AIA.

Gemini, Arrow Partner To Launch Northern Lights ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:GYLD) | ETF Daily News


































 



























































Gemini, Arrow Partner To Launch Northern Lights ETF Trust


 December 20, 2012 3:37pm  NYSE:GYLD  



 




Gemini Fund Services, LLC (Gemini), an engaged partner to independent advisers as a provider of comprehensive, pooled investment solutions, and Arrow Investment Advisors, LLC (Arrow), the adviser to Arrow Funds and ArrowShares, have teamed up to launch the Northern




 Lights ETF Trust (NLET), a shared fund trust designed to bring innovative exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to market.
NLET will provide benefits to advisers similar to Gemini’s shared fund trusts for mutual funds. The trust will be comprised of independent ETFs managed by separate investment advisers. Like Gemini’s shared mutual fund trusts, NLET will provide ETF advisers with operational efficiencies and economies of scale they would not be able to achieve on their own.
“The combined experience and expertise that Gemini has acquired from managing its shared mutual fund trusts and that Arrow has obtained from developing exchange-traded solutions that can thrive in today’s ever-changing marketplace presents a powerful offering to advisers,” said Andrew Rogers , CEO of Gemini. “The Northern Lights ETF Trust will provide advisers with a complete suite of tools and support to overcome obstacles to market entry and bring their ETFs to investors.”
On May 8, 2012, Arrow launched NLET’s first ETF, the Arrow Dow Jones Global Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:GYLD), which seeks investment results corresponding to the price and yield performance of the Dow Jones Global Composite Yield Index (before fees and expenses). Gemini and Arrow will partner with other advisers to create additional ETFs within NLET.
“We have a history of working with Gemini’s mutual fund trust where they have had much success in helping advisers bring unique investment solutions to the marketplace,” says Joseph Barrato , CEO of Arrow Investment Advisors. “We are proud to continue our partnership and look forward to contributing our exchange traded fund expertise and exemptive relief status to help benefit those advisers seeking to gain entry into the ETF marketplace via NLET.”

Free commission offer applies to online purchases of Fidelity ETFs and select iShares ETFs in a Fidelity brokerage account. Fidelity accounts may require minimum balances. The sale of ETFs is subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). iShares ETFs and Fidelity ETFs are subject to a short-term trading fee by Fidelity if held less than 30 days.



$4.95 commission applies to online U.S. equity trades in a Fidelity retail account only for Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC retail clients. Certain accounts may require a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Sell orders are subject to an activity assessment fee (from $0.01 to $0.03 per $1,000 of principal). Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details. Employee equity compensation transactions and accounts managed by advisors or intermediaries through Fidelity Clearing and Custody Solutions are subject to different commission schedules.


          1. Strategic Insight Simfund/FI Desktop, data as of 7/31/2013. Based on a comparison of total expense ratios for U.S. sector level ETFs with similar holdings and investment objectives (using the MSCI and S&P Global Industry Classification System — GICS) within the universe of 298 ETFs Morningstar has classified as the Sector Stock asset class.
	
    

          2. BlackRock Global ETP Landscape Report 12/31/2015. Based on AUM, net new flows, and number of ETFs.
	
    

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.


          Research is provided for informational purposes only, does not constitute advice or guidance, nor is it an endorsement or recommendation for any particular security or trading strategy. Research is provided by independent companies not affiliated with Fidelity. Please determine which security, product, or service is right for you based on your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial situation. Be sure to review your decisions periodically to make sure they are still consistent with your goals.
	
    

For iShares ETFs, Fidelity receives compensation from the ETF sponsor and/or its affiliates in connection with an exclusive long-term marketing program that includes promotion of iShares ETFs and inclusion of iShares funds in certain FBS platforms and investment programs. Additional information about the sources, amounts, and terms of compensation can be found in the ETF’s prospectus and related documents. Fidelity may add or waive commissions on ETFs without prior notice. BlackRock and iShares are registered trademarks of BlackRock Inc., and its affiliates.


Strategic Advisers, Inc., and BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, are independent entities and are not legally affiliated. Strategic Advisers, Inc., is the investment manager for client accounts and implements trades for the accounts based on the model portfolio of investments it receives from BlackRock Investment Management, LLC. Strategic Advisers may select investments for an account that differ from BlackRock Investment Management's model.


BlackRock® Diversified Income Portfolio is a service offered through Strategic Advisers, Inc., a registered investment adviser and a Fidelity Investments company. This service provides discretionary money management for a fee.


Brokerage services are provided by Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC. Custody and other services are provided by National Financial Services LLC. Both are Fidelity Investments companies and Members of NYSE and SIPC.


Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Deposits of $50,000-$99,999 will receive 300 free trades, and deposits of $100,000 or more will receive 500 free trades. Trades must be used within 2 years of being credited to the customer’s account. Commission-free trades must be designated to the one account receiving the qualifying assets or amount and are limited to online domestic equities and options trades. Options trades are limited to 20 contracts or less per trade; for orders beyond these limitations, standard commission rates apply. No cash compensation will be given for any unused commission-free trades. Offer is nontransferable, limited to one per individual per rolling 12 months and may not be combined with other offers. Fidelity reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions or terminate this offer at any time. Other terms and conditions, or eligibility criteria may apply.


To be eligible, customers must register online at www.fidelity.com/ATP500free or through a representative. New accounts or designated eligible accounts must be funded within 60 days ("qualification period"). Cash, eligible securities, and/or margin debit balance transfers from multiple sources will be aggregated to determine total account funding; assets will be valued at the time Fidelity receives them. Allow up to seven business days for assets to be registered in the system. Funding must come from an external, non-Fidelity source via any standard monetary transfer method (a standard Transfer of Assets form, check, Electronic Funds Transfer, ADM deposit, etc.); rollovers from a former employer’s Fidelity record kept workplace savings plan are treated as coming from an external source for purposes of this offer. Net new assets mean external new money in minus money out, including distributions and transfers, during the qualification period.


Account holders must maintain a minimum account balance of $50,000 of net new assets for this free trade offer (minus any losses related to trading or market volatility) for at least nine months from the date on which the trades are credited to the account, otherwise commission charges may be incurred retroactively on free trade executions based on the applicable commission rate under Fidelity's Commission & Fee Schedule.


Eligible accounts include non-retirement (Individual or Joint) or Fidelity IRA (Rollover IRA, Traditional IRA, Inherited IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA) accounts in which individual security trading is not prohibited and which meet the minimum account opening or funding requirements.

Offer is not valid for non-U.S. residents; persons employed by FINRA or a securities organization in a regulatory capacity; employees of Fidelity, its affiliates, and members of their immediate families and households, or the media who cover financial services. Certain states and local jurisdictions have laws that limit or restrict public employees from accepting items of value from vendors such as Fidelity that provide services to public institutions. Some public entities such as governments, state universities, health care organizations, etc., also have internal policies that may contain similar restrictions. If you are a public official or employee, you should determine if one of these laws or internal policies applies to you. By accepting this incentive, we assume that you are in compliance with your jurisdiction’s laws and institution’s internal policies.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
