Baozun’s services transcend all aspects of the e-commerce chain, covering IT solutions, store operations, digital marketing, customer services, warehousing, and fulfillment.The company operates in the fast growing business-to-consumer e-commerce space, allowing online stores to operate with the company’s unique brand image and allows each company to control its own branding and merchandising through official marketplace stores.Related Link: IPO Outlook: Is Shopify A Better Investment Than Etsy?China’s brand e-commerce market is expected to grow from $4 billion in 2010 to $129 billion in 2014, a 145 percent compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). In 2017, these numbers expect to increase to $379 billion in 2017, a CAGR of 43 percent.Baozun’s brand partners grew from 56 in 2012 to 94 as of March 2015. The brands range from apparel, appliances, electronics, home, food and health, cosmetics and consumer goods, insurance and automobile. Many of its brand partners are market leaders in their industries, like Nike, Microsoft, Haagen Dazs, and Philips.China’s largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA), owns 23 percent of Baozun through the company’s investment unit Alibaba Investment Ltd. It is currently Baozun’s largest investor. After the offering, its stake will fall to 18.2 percent and its voting power will reduce to 10 percent.Financial InfoBaozun generates revenue in two ways: product sales and services.
