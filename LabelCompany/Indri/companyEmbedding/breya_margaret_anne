So you've invented the next great gadget, and you're sure it'll be a hit. In fact, you've got cartons of inventory stored in every room of your house that you're itching to sell, sell, sell. Your test market said they love it, but how can you reach the legions of consumers you're sure will want to buy it?Welcome to Sales 101. While there are countless books you can read about sales and marketing, here's a relatively simple, proven strategy that'll teach you how to market a product and grow your sales.Create a Sales PlanFirst, define your market as accurately as possible so you have a deeper understanding of exactly who you're selling to. For example, instead of all women, it may be working women with above-average incomes and kids under age 5. Instead of all men, it may be divorced men in their 40s with six-figure salaries. The more specific you get, the more accurately you'll be able to target your sales and marketing efforts, choosing the sales channels most receptive to your product.Next, you'll need to develop a sales plan. Before you groan, "Another plan," understand this can be a simple document for your eyes only that'll help you organize and think through your sales strategy. Write it in a way that makes sense for you. Typically, it should include the following:Sales goals: These goals should be specific and measurable, not something like selling a million units. Base them on the nature of your product and try to break them down into manageable parts. For example, sell 50 units to end-users in 30 days and sell 100 units to local independent retailers in six months.Sales activities: These are your tactics--how you plan to make the sale. You may say you'll sell direct-to-consumer through a website or via craft shows, for instance. Or this part of the plan may include activities like developing a sell sheet to send to independent retail stores.Target accounts: Your sales plan should also include the accounts you want to sell to. If it's end-users, for example, plan how you're going to reach them through eBay, classified ads or your website.Timelines: Put dates to all of the above elements so you can define your steps within a realistic timeline. Don't forget that your timelines should be fluid--if you're underachieving, your sales plan can help you figure out why and define the corrective steps you need to take.Finally, follow a proven process for growing sales over time. While it would be fabulous to have Wal-Mart carry your product right out of the gate, it may not be realistic. Most large retailers want to see a track record of successful sales before agreeing to take on a new product. Build Your MarketTo learn how to bring a product to market, begin by selling directly to end-users. This'll give you confidence that there's demand for your product and will also create referenceable customers that you can contact for product and packaging feedback before you hit the bigger leagues. So where can you reach your end-users?The web is one highly effective channel, and you can reach your market through your own website or via a site like eBay. You can also tap into your own personal network as you begin. Host a home party to share your product with friends and friends-of-friends, sell through local community groups and e-mail your network.Once you get feedback directly from your customers, refine the packaging and price point before approaching your next market--wholesalers. You'll probably start with small, independently owned, local stores. It's a good idea to start with them before hitting larger chain stores because it's easier to get in touch with the direct decision-maker, and they're more inclined to take on new, unique or hard-to-find items to differentiate themselves from larger stores. To sell to these retailers, be prepared and bring a product sell sheet, photos, product samples (if possible) and a succinct introductory letter to explain what's in it for them, highlighting your product's profit margin, features and benefits, and proven sales record.Expand to New MarketsOnce you've established sales strength with independent retailers and are ready to support new markets, it's time to sell to the big guns. Of course, exactly who those big guns are will depend on your product. For some, it's powerhouse general mass retailers, like Wal-Mart and Target, while other products will fit more specialized but equally powerful retailers, like Williams-Sonoma, The Sharper Image and Sephora.Note that when dealing with these major accounts, the sale is just the beginning of the deal. Handling fulfillment, returns, rollbacks, slotting fees, advertising and more will require strengthening your business's infrastructure and resources.But back to the sale. What's the best way to approach a larger retailer? Here's a quick cheat sheet:Get the correct buyer: One of your biggest challenges is finding the right buyer within a large organization, so do your homework. If you're experiencing roadblocks, consider hiring a distributor or manufacturer's rep who already has established relationships in your industry.Be prepared: Develop a presentation and have professional-looking sell sheets ready. Your product should also have packaging that's ready to go.Know your target: Understand what products they already carry and how yours will fit in. Don't waste your time pitching to a retailer who's unlikely to carry your product.Take advantage of special programs: Some mass retailers, such as Wal-Mart, have local purchase programs that give managers authority to try local items. And other retailers may have different initiatives, such as minority business programs.Be patient: It can take up to a year or longer before you see your product on store shelves, so don't get frustrated. And if the final answer is no, try to turn it into a learning experience.Finally, remember there are other sales channels besides the traditional brick-and-mortar retail store. Catalogs, TV shopping networks and online stores can also be excellent methods to enable you to learn how to market a product online.

Nichols Delivers Mv. Margaret Ann To Magnolia Marine




The mv. Margaret Ann has 3,000 hp. from twin Caterpillar 3512C Series II diesel engines.
May 18, 2015
By H. Nelson Spencer
Magnolia Marine Transport ushered in another new boat to its expanding fleet of vessels, the mv. Margaret Ann, April 9 at its operations base in Vicksburg, Miss. It is the 22nd vessel in Magnolia Marine’s fleet, with No. 23, to be named Deborah Miles, expected in December. The firm operates 76 tank barges. 
The new vessel, a retractable-pilothouse towboat built by Nichols Boat Company in Greenville, Miss., is a virtual twin to the mv. Ann Elise delivered in 2012. It measures 110 feet long by 32 feet wide by 10 feet, three inches high, with a working draft of 8-1/2 feet. Pilothouse eyelevel is 31 feet, although that figure drops to 17 feet, five inches, with the pilothouse retracted. 
Regular readers of The Waterways Journal are by now familiar with the unique method that Magnolia Marine developed to bring new vessels into the fold, so to speak. Rather than the traditional bottle breaking, the chief engineer pours blessed oil into the boat’s engine, a novelty that grew out of the Lampton family’s strong spirituality, said Lee Lampton, one of four sons in the business and the one responsible for the marine segment. When the company began adding new boats and naming them after family members, the Lamptons sought a more meaningful way than the traditional champagne christening to send the boats off on their endeavors. 
“It was at a meeting we had in 2006, before we put the mv. Mr. Lampton to work, that we decided to make the event more of a spiritual celebration than a party,” Lee Lampton said. “We thought why not bless the oil, which is after all the life blood of the engine.”
Since then Magnolia Marine has blessed seven towboats in this fashion, all but two of which, the mvs. Jody McMinn and Stan Humphreys, were named for family members. The practice has grown so popular with the crews that when the mv. Emily Davis was hurried into service without being blessed, the captain feared it might be haunted. Magnolia Marine conducted a blessing ceremony shortly thereafter.
The engines that received the blessed oil on the Margaret Ann are twin Caterpillar 3512C Series II diesels, which provide 3,000 hp. at 1,600 rpm., with a maximum daily fuel burn of 2,910 gallons. They were supplied by Fabick Power Systems in Fenton, Mo., and are mated to Haley HRV 2411 hydraulic gearboxes furnished by Haley Marine Gears of Greenville, Miss. The four-blade Sound propellers from Missouri Dry Dock in Cape Girardeau, Mo., measure 84 by 70 inches, on eight-inch shafts machined by Mississippi Marine Corporation.
Engines Inc. provided the twin 99-kw. John Deere generator sets. Also in the engineroom is a fire detection system plus a fixed fire system provided by FRS Inc. of New Orleans.
The mv. Margaret Ann has storage capacity for 46,000 gallons of fuel, 9,800 gallons of water and 1,400 gallons of lube oil within its tunneled hull. Controlled Water Systems of Memphis installed the fresh water filters for the potable water. 
Controlling the vessel’s two steering and four flanking rudders are an electric-over-hydraulic steering system and backup furnished by Custom Hydraulic Components of New Orleans. M&I Electric provided the engine alarms and installed all the wiring. Marine & Industrial Insulation of Ethel, La., did the insulation work. 
The four-deck boat has accommodations for a crew of nine, including additional bunks for steersmen, engineer trainees or guests. The centrally air-conditioned and heated crew quarters and lounge are equipped with flat-screen TVs with DVD players and satellite connections, and each room is equipped with Ethernet ports for computer use. The floors are covered with Tuflex resilient rubber flooring. 
The pilothouse has 5/8-inch cypress tongue-and-groove paneling, as does the galley, which is furnished with a refrigerator, upright freezer, chest-type freezer, electric range, ice maker, trash compactor, water cooler and microwave.
Navigation and communication equipment from Wheelhouse Electronics includes two Furuno radars, AIS and GPS; a Boatracs satellite communications system; three VHF radios; a DeHart swing indicator and rudder monitoring systems. 
Deck equipment includes two 50-ton Wintech winches and a Schoellhorn-Albrecht capstan. 
The vessel is named for Margaret Ann Lampton, wife of Lee Lampton. “We met on a blind date and have been married for 37 years,” Lampton said, hesitating for a moment to be sure he got the number right. She was given a framed certificate commemorating the event. The captain then received a ship’s Bible from the Rev. Michael Nation of Seamen’s Church Institute, who blessed the oil.
The crew of the Margaret Ann, at the time of the christening, was Steve Fillingame, captain; Carson Beck, relief captain; Charles Thornton, pilot; Rodger Ellis, chief engineer; Jeremy Tucker and Robert Richardson, mates; and Del Lollar, deckhand. 
Magnolia Marine is the river transportation arm of Ergon, which Les Lampton Jr., the still-active chairman, began in 1954 with one other employee to provide bulk lube oil to drilling operations in southern and central Mississippi. He started Magnolia Marine three years later with the leased vessel Jack T and three barges.
