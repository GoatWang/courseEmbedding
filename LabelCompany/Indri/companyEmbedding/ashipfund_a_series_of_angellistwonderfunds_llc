Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

The 99 Investor Problem


When the JOBS Act was finalized, one of the rule changes that had a lot of fanfare around it was the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have. Prior to the JOBS Act, it was 500, after which point the company had to register and report to the SEC just like it was a public company (even if it hadn’t gone public.) This was a major issue for many fast growing companies that either went through strange contortions not to have 500 investors, or filed with the SEC to get no-action letters. There were plenty of nuances around this rule and I was in the middle of several situations that structured around it legally. Each time it was a lot of overhead for the company in question, none of which added anything to the system except fees to the lawyers.
Lifting the number of investors to 2000 seemed to make sense. In the situations I was involved in it would have immediately solved the specific problem. So that’s good.
But ever since we started working with AngelList on FG Angels, we’ve been wrestling with something called we’ve been referring to as the 99 Investor Problem. We structure our investment in companies via an LLC that has all the individual FG Angels syndicate members in it. This simplifies life for the company as they only end up with 1 investor – the FG Angels syndicate LCC – rather than a bunch of individual investors. At this point we have 217 backers in our syndicate, so with us each company would end up having 218 separate investors if we didn’t use the LLC.
If everyone was on the cap table, the company would have to chase down 218 signatures for everything. Instead, using our approach, they have effectively two investors – our FG Angels syndicate (one investor) and Foundry Group (another investor). Two signatures. Much easier. We handle the Foundry Group signature. AngelList handles the syndicate signature.
Except it doesn’t work that way. The SEC limits an LLC to having 99 investors. So we can only have 99 of the 217 syndicate members participate. Now, there’s a nuance that excludes “qualified purchasers” (QPs) – individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets – from the 99 investor count. Overall our QPs + the top 99 investors in our syndicate represent $321,000 based on committed amounts to FG Angels. If you include the balance of the 237 members, we end up at a syndicate of $439,000. The company then gets our commitment of $50,000 on top of that.
As a result of this 99 investor limitation, we have two disappointing problems. First, we have over 100 investors who would like to invest in our syndicate with us who get excluded because of the 99 investor rule. Next, there is $118,000 per investment that we’d like to include in each syndicate that the companies we are investing in won’t get. Bad for the companies and bad for the investor.
We’ve spent lots of time over the past 60 days trying to solve the 99 investor problem. At this point, we’ve run into a dead end. We’ve tried multiple LLCs – that doesn’t work as they end up getting viewed as a single entity. We’ve tried other structures – that doesn’t work. We’re certainly open to ideas at this point.
In the mean time, until we solve this, AngelList is making the following changes to their Syndicates product.
– Qualified Purchasers: AngelList will include all Qualified Purchasers (individuals with $5M in assets and firms with $25M in assets) in each syndicated deal as they are exempt from the SEC’s 99-investor limit. We will soon email your backers to determine if they are Qualified Purchasers (QPs) and we will update your syndicate management interface to indicate the QPs.
– Top 99 Backers: The next time you syndicate a deal, we will include all QPs and the top 99 non-QPs by commitment amount. You can override this default to include specific backers who are not in the top 99. The top 99 backers will change dynamically as backers adjust their backing amounts.
– Funds: We are working on new funds products to allow additional investors who are not in your top 99 backers or QPs to participate in your syndicated deals.
– Notifying Backers: Finally, we will notify your backers of the SEC’s 99-investor restriction this week and give them the opportunity to change their backing amounts.
We are bummed about this because part of our goal is to build a very large angel network as a result of the FG Angels activity. The 99 investor rule directly undermines this, and limits the amount of investment and support for the companies we are investing in. It’s another example of the challenges of the JOBS Act and another discovery on our part of the “miss” between the goal of the new law and the implementation.










Sean Killeen



[disclaimer: I know next to nothing about these aspects of business, and am purely spitballing, so apologies if this is unworkable] A thought: instead of splitting up the investors into groups, could you split up what they’re investing in into groups? If you have ~300 investors, could you create three entities for them to invest in that are all controlled by the syndicate, which would allow 99 per? Trying to turn the problem on its head to see if it makes more sense to shuffle things around on the flip side.






jasonmendelson



the SEC is too smart for that and will consider them as one entity.  Sigh…..








David Brooks



Very interesting. I would assume this will lead to a small number of very large syndicates. Hopefully AngelList creates enough transparency among smaller investors so that they know where they stack up in a syndicate, and have flexibility to move to others with less backing. But will investors do that, or is the idea of a superstar lead too compelling?






jasonmendelson



Trying to post again…. I agree with your take.  Large syndicates will need to have higher investing followers.  No idea what investors will do, but it’s a serious bummer that we can’t truly have crowdfunding here.








JLM



.
Potential solution:
Investors form GP or LP with unlimited number of investors and with conditions determined by investors en masse.   This effectively mirrors the AngelList syndicate rules.  You are effectively moving the AngelList rules upstream.
GP or LP forms LLC with a single managing member and the GP or LP as other member.
LLC — with single managing member and GP or LP member — joins AngelList as investment vehicle.
New LLC makes investments and complies with all SEC/JOBS Act and AngelList rules.
Variation on theme:  Each investment uses a mirror image but “one off” LLC in order not to commingle different investments.  This would also be a bit of legal insurance against spill over legal liability.
JLM

Millie Tadewaldt



Good ideas. The issue here is that the SEC is too smart for that 🙂 and it “looks through” all investment vehicles that are formed specifically for the purpose of buying the same portfolio company, counting all of the individual investors in those special purpose vehicles against the investor limit. 
It is possible for form a more “fund-like” investment vehicle that deploys capital across multiple deals without triggering the look-through.








DaveJ



Have you looked into setting it up as a mutual fund?






jasonmendelson



We haven’t because as mutual fund managers, we’d be liable to all of the syndicate members if we chose bad investors.  Our investors in the our main venture funds would not allow this and we are generally scared of lawyers.  (Which is why I stopped looking in mirrors long ago).






Joe Wallin



DaveJ–cost of being a mutual fund is prohibitive. So, it is not a practical solution.








Brett Topche



It’s an issue for small traditional funds as well. Depending on which SEC exemption you use to raise your fund, you are typically limited to 99 LPs. Not an issue for larger funds with fewer, larger institutional commitments, but for smaller funds raised primarily from high net worth individuals, it can be a pain in the ass. Also, from the company standpoint, if the LLC is formed solely for the purpose of investing in that company (i.e. your syndicate forms a new LLC for each investment, which seems likely given that the syndicate changes over time), all of the investors in the LLC count towards their 2,000 limit. Not necessarily a huge deal for one syndicate investing in a company, but if you have a couple of syndicates involved, even though you only have to chase down one signature, you can start eating into your 2,000.






jasonmendelson



Agreed.








tubby_bartles



This issue is more difficult than other AngelList issues. Elsewhere, AngelList is meeting the spirit of the law, but needed to find a clever way to meet the letter of the law as well given the new technologies.
In this case, the spirit of the 99 investor rule is to prevent large number of investors from acting as a coordinated group without “being public”. So the SEC has had many, many years to plug every possible letter-of-the-law loophole.
The specific legal language doesn’t refer to funds – it refers to “organized groups” and the SEC considers that to mean they look through any legal structure you pick to see whether the group is organized as a single group or not.
Splitting investments (into parallel funds or by groups of “upstream” funds as suggested in the comments here) is already said by the SEC to count all investors. 
I suspect this one may need a law change to address.






jasonmendelson



I agree.  The integration issues that SEC makes part of  the issue kills us.  Perhaps a no-action letter is due?






Sean Schantzen



Have you found a way that a no action letter could help with this? The limit comes from the Investment Company Act and is in the statute itself (which I don’t think a no action letter could change). I don’t know anyway around it without running into integration issues (maybe a creative no action letter that addresses just integration, since integration isn’t in the statute, but the SEC would really have to be on board with syndicates). We’ve been trying to find a work around for this too, but came to the same conclusions. If someone goes down the no action letter road, we’d be happy to be involved and help out.






jasonmendelson



I haven’t found a way, it’s just a theory.  If the SEC won’t bust us, we are clean but this is a very broad topic that a no action letter might not work for.






Sean Schantzen



Thanks. The whole 99 investor limit seems like a relic just like the 500 investor reporting limit. It would be great to at least increase it by the same 4x the 500 investor limit was, regardless of whether by no action letter or statute change.






jasonmendelson



agreed














DL



JLM outlined the direction SproutrHouse is looking for a solution. Brad, where has this path led you?
Since Angel List began offering Syndicates, I have been working to solve a variation of this problem to serve early-stage companies privately at SproutrHouse. SproutrHouse offers natural CPG brands a simple crowd funding solution but it’s a $125-$400k investment that the market is seeking and one SproutrHouse is well-suited to address.






jasonmendelson



We’ve actually only been led to the ideas that Brad describes above.  I have a feeling we are headed toward a request for a SEC no-action letter, but the issue might be too broad and need legislative action.








Carlos



Does a Series LLC work?  Not available in Cali, but who wants to do business there anyway 😉 #stackexchange.  I am exploring using a series LLC in a novel way to promote investment into a core technology, where each individual “app” of this core technology could be its own company.  Separates investors, liability, minimizes paperwork, and above all fees right?  Would this be something you guys would entertain in funding in my case? Hoping that this could be useful in this case as well.  This afterall was given birth via the mutual fund industry, per wikipedia:    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_LLC






jasonmendelson



Well, unfortunately we need to be able to do business in CA, so no.  And if you make the company split up like that you get pass through taxes to the investors which doesn’t work, either.  Thanks for the idea!








JMN



If section 3(c)(1) is not amended, the 100 investor
limit could severally undermine the JOBS Act’s on several levels. The accredited
investor verification requirements, as defined by the JOBS Act, should be
sufficient foundation to argue a 2,000 investor cap – in line with the max. number
of AI’s a private company can introduce as shareholders. A no-action letter may
work if the SEC’s fully aware its efforts surrounding the JOBS Act could be
vein.






bfeld



Yup. It feels like one possible solution is a no-action letter, but this ultimately is a one-off per organization (e.g. AngelList) so it doesn’t really solve the overall problem.






JMN



Although a one-off result, the outcome would set a precedent assisting other organizations, startups, small investors. The other option is a collective effort to force an amendment to section 3(c)(1). If common sense prevailed, the upside benefits far outweigh the downside risk if the investor cap was increased in line with allowable shareholders (letting companies decide the weighting) subject to AI’s being certified pursuant to Title II.










riverland



could this be relevant or helpful? https://verifyinvestor.com/






bfeld



Sort of. AngelList is doing this for free however – see https://www.feld.com/archives/2014/01/angellist-accreditation-report.html






Jor Law



Hi, Co-founder of VerifyInvestor.com and AngelList fan here.  What we do is similar to what AngelList provides, but they have a limited use case while ours is a more reliable and comprehensive solution.  Their solution is great for their platform, I think, but ours is something that can be relied upon by companies, their advisors/professionals and investors who need certainty of compliance.






Jor Law



Somehow my other post got removed, but I did want to add that https://verifyinvestor.com doesn’t currently address the Investment Company Act and 100 invest limit issue.  It’s more a solution relating to general solicitation and 506(c).










ObjectMethodology.com



Sounds like we need an “OWNERSHIP Act”? Something that let’s people in the US (a country based on freedom) be free to do as they please.






Scott



Welcome to my world, Brad.  The Company Act and the investor slot issues are a real pain in the ass.  As you’ve discovered, if you structure your vehicles as 3(c)7 vehicles by including only QPs, you’ll be ok.  It’s actually pretty easy.  If you must accommodate accredited investors, look into Registered Investment Company (“RIC”) structures.  A closed end RIC (essentially a ’40 Act, closed-end mutual fund structure) allows you to aggregate accredited investor capital in a private vehicle.  It’s not a free lunch – you’ll need to be registered, have an independent board, have third-party admin, etc.  On the plus side, its fairly permanent capital (liquidity with gating), is flexible, and offers the ability to reinvest proceeds or dividend out proceeds, and is well traveled ground.  You should look into it.  There is a cost, but if the money you’re aggregating is big enough, it could make sense.






bfeld



Yup – we know this well – and have no interest in going down this path. That’s not – in our mind – the goals of the JOBS Act, nor is it how we approach our world in general, which is why (a) we’ve never done this sort of thing in the past and (b) we are intrigued and excited about the ground AngelList is plowing.








Felix Dashevsky



This issue arises because you are (double-) pooling investors.  Given the electronic/easy nature of AngelList closing process, I question the need for a separate syndicate LLC.  Let the investors invest directly into Startups. And play with Startup funding docs to ensure streamlined future interaction with investors (or use power of attorney, advisory contract, or solve it technologically).   
The issue such direct structure would highlight is your (and AngelList’s) fee.  However, I think you can structure around it (options/warrants at OpCo, investment advisory contract, something else creative).  If it is an advisory contract, you’ll run into Investment Advisory Act and “qualified client” issues…  but frankly I am not sure how you (or AngelList) have avoided these so far.






bfeld



If I was on the startup side, I wouldn’t want this. Regardless of the legal docs, there will be at least one situation where you have to chase down signatures and that could be the nightmare.
We’ve focused very hard on the legal dynamics around IAA and are very comfortable, but really understanding it has been non-trivial.






Felix Dashevsky



But isn’t that what the JOBS Act was about?  Like the 2000 limit you alluded to in the opening paragraph (“a lot of fanfare around […] the increase in the number of shareholders a private company could have”).  Or the crowdfunding bits.  It wasn’t about broader access to fund-like structures, but to startups.  If startups want just a couple of big investors… well, we don’t need the JOBS Act at all.  If we step back, nothing we are discussing was in fact affected by the JOBS Act–FG Angels is using the “old” 506(b) pathway.






bfeld



Since we are using 506(b), you are correct. Which means that the JOBS acts is not accomplishing the goal!






Felix Dashevsky



Which was what?






Felix Dashevsky



My point is that neither the JOBS Act, nor any other rule on startup fundraising is causing any issue here.  The “99-problem” is not endemic to startup investing (like the “500-problem” is).






bfeld



I guess I just disagree. If you’ve been following what we’ve tried to do with FG Angel, it’s very much about democratizing startup investing, and the 99 investor rule is a huge disconnect from the JOBS Act goals, especially in raising the private investor cap from 500 to 2000.






Felix Dashevsky



Fair enough.  I am following FG Angel by backing it.  Although not sure if I will make it into the 99 the next time!






JMN



Brad, I concur with your position. The question is what can be done to resolve this hurdle? There’s always a solution. Jason Best and team at Crowdfund Capital Advisors (https://crowdfundcapitaladvisors.com/about-us/our-team/jason-best.html), may be a starting point.






JMN



It appears my previous comment was removed because a link to a third party’s website was included? A private company found on the net that was involved with pushing the JOBS Act legislation through. My point was there’s sure to be a solution to this problem. But it’s going to take some digging and talking to the right people who can push for change at the legislative level. Otherwise, the “99 investor problem” is here to stay, there’s no way around it.














Eddie Wharton



Could you have a 99 person Brad-FG Angels LLC, another 99 person Jason-FG Angels LLC, etc.? Instead of combining them off the cap table just include 3 different LLC’s. It would be a bit more work, is not a scalable solution past a certain point and relies enormously on the trust that you have built to make sure all of the FG Angel LLC make the exact same investments with the same terms.  
This is not an effective solution for everybody and one part of the law seems to undermine the spirit of another.  Big picture, that needs to be fixed. However, this could be a way to keep FG Angels growing and still have a low single digit number of additions to the cap table.






jasonmendelson



I wish.  SEC would look into “who is Brad / Jason” and realize we are partners and then game over.  They integrate and we are “done”






Joe Wallin



I think we ought to just repeal the investment company act…










Steve Consilvio



Stop investing and give your money away!
I love it how rich prigs think they are helping others by lending them money and then sucking the blood out of a new business. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves.






Fred Destin



My personal view is that we do this one step at a time and prove we are responsible actors on a functional platform.  The 99 investor problem could also refer to 1999 when retail investors were left holding cats in bags prepared for them by professional investors.  Let’s build a strong platform with good diligence tools, social signals, evidence of track record and then go back and propose the next regulatory evolution.  I am convinced there is a day where crowdfunding will apply to startups as it applies to products on Kickstarter, but we need to make sure it’s done well.  Let’s celebrate the deregulation, demonstrate our platform works, and then fight for the next step.






bfeld



Fair enough. 
However, when the 500 shareholder limit was raised to 2,000, I don’t think anyone was paying attention to the 99 LLC rule. If there was thoughtful discussion about it, that’s cool. But my instinct is that there wasn’t. And that’s what’s frustrating / disappointing to me.
I think the gang at AngelList was just as surprised by this based on all of our work together. Since you are investors directly in AngelList, realizing that their initial view was there was no problem having larger syndicates is probably important as part of understanding how this all evolves.
As we planned from the beginning, the FG Angels experiment is just that – an experiment – so we are happy to find all the limitations, edge cases, and problems. I don’t think our behavior or performance is – or should be – a proxy for regulators as we are merely one data point, so I’m happy to be public about all the challenges we run into.








Steven Kane



Hi Brad. Re the chasing signatures issue. Couldnt the startup simply require angels who invest directly to submit to some kind of “drag along” right? Meaning, once the angel’s money is invested, no signatures are ever required ever again?






bfeld



Possibly. It’s one of the approaches we’ve looked at. We – and some of the companies we’ve talked to – aren’t comfortable with it since it still ends up with a huge number of individual investors on the cap table.








lunarmobiscuit



The Investment Act and SEC seems to have thought through every straightforward workaround.  Given that, it seems the best path is to go back and questions the assumptions.  You set up this LLC to: (a) simplify the paperwork for the investees, (b) centralize the decision making  of the syndicate, (c) prove out the AngelList crowdfunding model.
Of these, only (a) is limited by the rules.  I saw in the comments that the rules don’t allow you to run one LLC and any of your Foundry partners to run a second LLC.  But what stops any of the other 216 people in the syndicate from setting up a second LLC?  A “Not-FG Angels LLC”, whose manager receives no communications from you, but who watches AngelList to see what FG Angels invests in and follows along.
You pick 98 others to be part of FG Angels, and someone from the other 119 others not picked can choose 98 more for Not-FG Angels LLC, and so on with Truly-Not-FG Angels, until you hit the 2,000 investor limit, which I believe really has no workaround.






bfeld



That’s a valid hack and certainly open to anyone who wants to do it.






rxdxt



This is Richard Titus, founder of Prompt.ly (Foundry Syndicate investment 2) -chiming in… I agree this is a real problem. Prompt.ly was super excited about the opportunity & the democratic innovation in investment – but we were surprised the final investment amount was so much lower than commitments. (it all worked out as we were significantly oversubscribed via direct investment.) 
Perhaps syndicates could “back each other up”?  i.e. each syndicate could act as a “sub-manager” to investors who are interested in a deal, but cannot fit into the 1st 198 investors of the original syndicator?  I’d be happy to serve in this capacity for Foundry.
It should be noted we (and I hope you don’t mind we did this) “picked off” some of the obviously QP investors and invited them to invest directly to allow more people into the deal – but until the SEC & IRS solve this that seemed the best way to preserve access. – to our view the purpose of Angellist is to level the playing field for investors – particularly smaller ones and diversify the investment landscape. 
Based on my fantastic experience as an entrepreneur being backed by Foundry & it’s syndicate – I’ve started my own!  
Thanks again!






bfeld



We’re glad you picked off additional QP investors to invest directly. All good…










Henry Glover



What if the 217 members pooled together to form a firm with $25m in assets making one “qualified purchaser”  Might be silly for one deal but if you had a lot of people in a “firm” it basically makes the firm a really large syndicate.  Im guessing it would require either bigger checks, more people + a lot of deals for it to scale… vc firm






bfeld



That won’t work as the entity will have > 99 investors.








Scott Kosch



Brad, I’m in your syndicate and make the 99 cut-off because of my per-deal amount, but I also qualify as a QP.  Just got around to getting a letter from a financial institution to attest to this, but in the online form it also mentions that they might periodically run my credit history.  I don’t like the idea of having my credit run frequently (like possibly for every deal or even a few times per year), because this negatively impacts credit scores (which I think is crazy).  Can you say anything about this?  I hate to fill an accredited spot, when I could be included as a QP, but the periodic credit check gave me pause.






bfeld



I don’t know the answer to this specifically but will check.






Scott Kosch



Brad, thanks for asking AL about this.  Here is what I learned, so that others don’t shy away from validating their QP status.  The credit check they perform is called a “soft pull.”  Add your own joke to that.  It does not impact your credit score, unlike a “hard pull.”  Nevertheless, if you still want to avoid this repeated credit check for each deal, there are two ways AL may not need to check as frequently.  First, if you invest through an entity, which is wholly-owned by one or more QPs, then that entity is a QP, and they shouldn’t need to run your credit personally. Second, if you can verify that your Net Worth is greater than $5M and not just your Net Assets (i.e., your Net Worth would be less debt and other liabilities), then credit checks aren’t necessary.  Anyway, happy that I can make room for one more investor by changing my status.








TejDhawan



That’s an interesting observation. You’re correct that the credit score would likely by hit by the credit check. The credit report would generally affirm the salary based qualification requirements, but not the remaining 8 or 9, as financial assets, non-profit work, institutional mgmt etc. don’t make it into credit checks. The criminal/bankruptcy items that do make it into credit checks would apply to the companies raising the funding through FG Angels+syndicate.
Interesting question to send to AL directly as well, and this is making me think that the company raising the funds should also be providing representations that they clear the ‘bad actor disqualification’ test.

What I learned as the first analyst on AngelList’s investment teamHomepageFollowSign in / Sign upAlexander PackBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingNetwork Investing @BainCapVCDec 14, 2016What I learned as the first analyst on the AngelList investment teamIn 2016, I closed over 100 venture-backed tech deals, helped launch a $50M business, and worked with some of the best investors in the world. I’m the first graduate of AngelList’s analyst program and this is the inside story of my year in the trenches.When I first saw the job posting I wasn’t sure what to expect. Was this an investment or business role? I had already been a VC analyst at an early stage VC fund in Hong Kong, which I left to co-found an education startup that the firm funded. After seeing glowing endorsements from VCs on Twitter, however, I decided to throw my hat in the ring.I learned that being an analyst at AngelList is much different than being an analyst at a VC firm. Most VCs will only do a handful of deals a year. As a VC analyst I once spent months sourcing and evaluating a single startup. AngelList does over 500 deals a year.The Analyst Role: Venture Capital at ScaleTo source so many deals, AngelList relies on a network of 300 “syndicate leads” — experienced venture investors who hunt down deals and bring them to AngelList’s platform.Syndicate leads include famous angel investors (like Gil Penchina, Semil Shah, Cyan Banister) and even small VCs (like 500 Startups, Precursor Ventures, Arena Ventures). AngelList then invites investors and pools them into a single-deal fund that invests in the company. Investors range from other angels to professional venture funds set up specifically to invest on AngelList (like the $400M fund CSC Upshot).The main job of an AngelList analyst is to make sure these 500 deals close.Analysts sit in the middle of the marketplace, coordinating and managing the relationships between leads, founders, investors and the lawyers on each deal. It’s a mixture of account management, customer success, and legal operations. Since you’re on the front lines, you often become the resident customer expert and product specialist that the engineers and designers will consult when they ship new features. Analysts also get the chance to do special projects, usually related to launching a new feature or scaling a process.Early in your career you should be optimizing for two things: learning and building your network. So: what do you learn as an analyst and who do you work with?Learning #1: Early Stage Tech InvestingVCs say that the best way to become a better investor is through pattern recognition, developed over decades of seeing which deals get funded, exit, or fail. Analysts at AngelList build pattern recognition at hyperspeed.I managed over 100 deals in my year as an analyst. They ranged from pre-seed to monster pre-IPO rounds, were located everywhere from San Francisco to Bangalore, and were almost all rounds led by top VCs like Andreessen Horowitz or Founders Fund, or smaller but equally prestigious firms like Floodgate and Freestyle. In general, AngelList facilitates investments in 20–30% of venture rounds in Silicon Valley. Analysts have their finger on the pulse of early stage tech investing.Analysts also get to see the details of each deal: the price, terms, cap table, pitch deck and diligence materials. You hear the syndicate leads’ investment thesis and often talk to founders. You quickly learn things like what kind of traction a company needs to raise an A or what the best VR investors think will happen with Oculus.Unsurprisingly, many employees also angel invest. I even started my own syndicate. My first syndicate was a $300K investment into a seed startup called Numerai that is disrupting AI-based quant trading in a similar way that AngelList is disrupting VC financing.They just recently announced a Series A follow-on round led by Union Square Ventures.Learning #2: How to Scale a Tech MarketplaceAnalysts at AngelList are managing a complex and growing technology marketplace. Because the team is so small there are plenty of opportunities to go after high impact projects.I started tinkering on an idea to grow the investor side of our marketplace that took off. The project now manages $50M in annualized spending and we’ve built a cross-functional team dedicated to Capital Growth. Another analyst quarterbacked the fundraising process for our Access Fund. Not many people in their 20s can say they helped raise an 8-figure venture fund.The NetworkI joined AngelList because I figured it was at the center of the startup universe. The quality of the network here is hard to beat.The CEO, Naval Ravikant, has been ranked one of the top angel investors in the US and was an early investor in Uber and Twitter. Three months into the job I was charged with managing Naval’s syndicate, which gave me an incredible look into how a top investor evaluates and closes deals. I’ve worked on product management with Graham Jenkin, our COO and Chief Designer, a former Google executive who led the redesign of AdWords. Another AngelList heavyweight is startup guru Parker Thompson (the great Startup L. Jackson), who knows seed stage investing inside and out.Analysts also get to know the investors and founders on the site. I’ve worked with the investor who runs the largest programmer conference in the world, the VP of Business at Checkr, and the largest early stage tech investors in Belgium and Turkey. Half of CB Insights’ list of Top 20 Angel Investors have used AngelList to syndicate deals.DisclaimersI’ve enjoyed my analyst experience and gotten a lot out of it, but it’s not for everybody.First: it’s very different from a VC firm. VC analysts dig deep into each investment in a very intellectual way. You don’t do that as much as an AngelList analyst.Second: analysts are responsible for the down and dirty tasks that need to get done. Expect late night calls from frantic syndicate leads worried that the deal won’t close in time or financing docs from lawyers with hundreds of markups. Much of the work is not glamorous — you’re not making investment decisions or advising founders on business strategy — but it’s valuable learning.Third: AngelList is still small and light on structure. Most employees are either ex-founders or “future founders”, so things can get chaotic. You’re not getting your hand held like you would in McKinsey’s analyst program.But if you’re entrepreneurial, know a little bit about venture and startups and want to learn more than you ever thought possible, then there’s nothing else like AngelList.Apply for the Analyst Program | Back my AngelList SyndicateThanks to Victor Ghitescu, Richard Freling, Simon Pickert, Mike Daugherty, Parker Thompson, Naval Ravikant, Nivi, Graham Jenkin, and James Gibson for reading drafts.Share500Never miss a story from Startup Grind, when you sign up for Medium.

AngelList acquires Product Hunt

Geenee picks up $4.4 million Series A to make Instagram more shoppable












AngelList, the LinkedIn for startups, just bought Product Hunt, the platform where people vote up or down on startup products.
Product Hunt declined to comment on the selling price but a source close to the matter tells us it was about $20 million. Recode first reported that same price. 
Product Hunt was rumored to be raising its next round for the past several months but, as founder Ryan Hoover tells TechCrunch, AngelList seemed like the best option for the future of the company and now the two are combining forces.
Hoover and AngelList’s Naval Ravikant, who invested in Product Hunt previously, met shortly after Hoover launched his platform but the PH founder says he had some initial concern AngelList could potentially move into the same consumer-focused product discovery platform he’d built on Product Hunt.
On the flip of that was AngelList’s concern Product Hunt could easily turn into a similar fundraising platform for startups. However, the two continued to talk and that fear never materialized. Instead, Hoover says he now sees more opportunities in working together.
Though Hoover doesn’t deny he was trying to raise a round (we’ve heard in the $7 to $9 million range) he says he’s been chatting for the last four months with Ravikant on what an acquisition would look like.
“This was just the better option,” Hoover told TechCrunch of deciding to sell. “It wasn’t our only option by any means.”
Hoover didn’t want to say what those other options were, but he did say there was an element of trust and a mutual alignment with the AngelList deal.
“This was super important in taking that next step,” Hoover said. “We had to look at Naval and his team and say ‘are they just going to acquire us and shut us down?’ for instance…but Naval made it very, very clear that he invested personally in what we’re doing because he believes in our vision for the future.”
And Ravikant seems to agree with Hoover, telling TechCrunch, “Product Hunt is a perfect fit for us.”
“We already help founders raise money and recruit talent,” Ravikant continued. “With Product Hunt, we can also help founders launch products and find early adopter customers. It dovetails very nicely into our mission of helping founders. With this acquisition, we become the network for technology companies.”
Product Hunt has struggled in the past to break out of tech and into mainstream product discovery. But the platform has continued to grow as a tech tastemaker, going from a small batch of 1,000 when it launched in late 2013 to now driving over 100 million product discoveries (defined as people clicking out to sites) for 50,000 companies, according to Product Hunt.
And Hoover is now leaning in to his base. “Several millions of people work in tech and tech is something that affects all of our lives,” Hoover said. “But now in this new AngelList and Product Hunt collaboration, in this new world, it’s actually an opportunity to help the tech industry but it still doesn’t sacrifice our mission or our vision of becoming even bigger.”
What Product Hunt will become under AngelList remains to be seen, but Hoover assured not much will change. He will still be the CEO and says he’ll run Product Hunt independently in the same way Instagram, which was purchased by Facebook, still runs its own platform.
Hoover and his team, which is mostly remote at the moment due to a separate San Francisco office lease headache, will also move into some space set aside for them at AngelList headquarters in San Francisco’s financial district.
The biggest challenge moving forward for Hoover is how to get the two teams to come together. “A lot of that challenge is how to make the transition smooth for everyone. It’s never going to be 100 percent perfect but that’s fine,” Hoover said. “On the plus side we’ll no longer be homeless and we’ll be able to focus on building what we’re building.”

From Lightspeed to AngelList: Jake Seid on his investment in Roofstock, and the future of real…FollowSign in / Sign upAngelListBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingRaise money and recruit on AngelList. Launch on @ProductHunt.Mar 20From Lightspeed to AngelList: Jake Seid on his investment in Roofstock, and the future of real estateJake Seid spent over a decade as Managing Director at Lightspeed Venture Partners, and four years as President of real estate giant Auction.com (now Ten-X), before dedicating his time investing in the future of real estate (among other themes). In this interview, we go inside his investment in Roofstock, a real estate startup that just raised a $20M Series B from Lightspeed and others, to learn:Why Jake thinks real estate is the next big pillar of the economy to move onlineHow Roofstock is making investing in rental properties as accessible as investing in the stock marketHow Jake leverages his experience at Lightspeed and Ten-X to bring value to startup foundersJulie Ruvolo: I want to start with your Google Images result. Did you have a prior life as a bodybuilder?Jake Seid: That would be a fascinating blog post, “From Bodybuilder to VC,” but unfortunately that’s not me.You are Jake Seid, the VC. You’ve had a long track record at Lightspeed Venture Partners, one of the top performing funds in Silicon Valley.Lightspeed is a top fund: Cisco bought AppDynamics for $3.7 billion, Nutanix went public at $5 billion market cap, MuleSoft filed for IPO recently, and Snapchat just had a huge IPO. It’s a great partnership that works extremely hard for their companies.What did you carry forward from your time there?My eleven years at Lightspeed were formative. I joined when I was around 24, after running a successful product line at Cisco Systems. I learned a tremendous amount about how startups get built, how they succeed and where the potholes are.I learned a lot about people as well. It all sounds very generic, but you start with great teams and very large markets, and from there, you look at other things, like business models: Do you have a model that has a chance of being a high margin business? A model where you can build barriers to entry over time, versus it becoming very competitive and having your margins get competed away?After Lightspeed, you spent four years at Ten-X, an 800-person company that does billions in annual real estate transactions. Walk us through that transition.Another thing I learned at Lightspeed, very large companies are built when you pioneer moving a pillar of the economy from offline to online: Amazon in retail, Google in advertising, Priceline in travel.In 2011, the number of large, trillion-dollar-plus pillars of the economy that had not yet made their initial move online were fewer and further between. However, when I started looking at what other big pillars of the economy have not yet made that shift, I saw that real estate was one of them.I joined Auction.com (now Ten-X) in 2011, which at the time had a large offline real estate business, but was looking to build on the auction experience and create an eBay competitor. I took the company in a different direction of building a vertical marketplace focused only on real estate transactions. My view was that being a vertically focused, two-sided marketplace (versus horizontal like an eBay) is just fine when you’re dealing with a multi-trillion dollar market.Real estate is such a vast and diverse industry. I saw opportunities across many pieces of the real estate ecosystem that Ten-X was not focused on, and I wanted to start investing in that ecosystem. So I moved to the advisory board of Ten-X and now spent the majority of my time investing and advising.You recently invested in Roofstock, an Oakland-based startup that is trying to make investing in single-family rental properties as easy as investing in the stock market. What is the opportunity, as you see it?The founders of Roofstock, Gary Beasley and Gregor Watson, are a very dynamic team. They pioneered the “Own to Rent” category in the offline world, meaning that instead of finding a home to fix and flip it, you buy a home to rent it out for a long time.Many people own stocks, but they don’t own real estate as part of their overall investment portfolio because buying an investment property is like buying a job: Somebody has to manage it. Even if you hire a property manager, somebody has to manage that property manager and deal with the inevitable things that come with owning and maintaining a home.The key idea with Roofstock is to separate operating from investing and do for the real estate market what Charles Schwab did for the stock market. And when you do it at an institutional scale, you get a lot of efficiencies: You’re able to bring a lot of great talent to bear to manage your assets, manage the tenants, and deal with vacancies on behalf of individual owners. You get great insight into the properties that are coming onto the market because you own a bunch of properties, and you know exactly what’s going on in that market.As an example of the scale of the opportunity, today there are about 12 million homes in the US that are owned for rental purposes. If you just make that process more efficient, it’s a big market, but there’s an opportunity to grow the market as well.How did your relationship with Roofstock come together?I knew of the founders and their good work in their previous company, Waypoint, from my time at Ten-X. Khosla Ventures introduced me to Gary and Gregor and we hit it off, so I joined as an advisor. As their Series B came together, we felt it would make sense to put together an AngelList syndicate to participate in the round that Lightspeed was leading.Roofstock raised $20M for their Series B, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation from existing investors Khosla Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, Nyca Partners, QED Investors and SV Angel. How much did you invest through your AngelList syndicate? Were the other VCs welcoming of your participation?It was pretty straightforward. I typically try to put together something that is not going to take ownership away from the guys who are leading and trying to get ownership but also makes sense from an AngelList syndicate perspective, regarding not being too small. In a $20M round, something in the order of 6 figures isn’t a big enough bite to get anybody worried.I’m relatively new to AngelList — I’ve been investing on the platform for eight months or so. I think a lot of VCs and entrepreneurs have an initial concern about AngelList like, “Oh, my confidential information is going to get broadcast to the world. People might think of starting or investing in a competitor, and I don’t want that.” I think AngelList’s early days were more about casting wider nets.Whereas now all of the deals on AngelList are private by default.It seems like it’s become much more of a private fundraising platform, as opposed to a public one.Are there any parts of the AngeList platform that have been particularly useful for you?One thing that’s very useful is the trust that AngelList has built up with regards to the vehicles that they structure. As an example, when you pull together investors for a deal, nobody’s asking to read the LLC agreement or make changes to the agreements.If you’re an individual investor putting together special purpose vehicles, it can be a lot of headache for both the lead as well as the syndicate investors to understand each and every LLC that’s put together. Because AngelList has brought standardization to this, it gives everybody comfort and makes the process smooth.The other great thing about AngelList is that it allows people to go beyond their typical network of investors and expand their syndicate base. It allows people with capital to find people doing interesting deals, and take part when they might not have been able to in the past.What’s your approach for working with founders you’ve invested in? Anything you carry over from your time at Lightspeed and Ten-X?When working with a CEO, I can help to bridge the Board-level perspective of the VCs with the day-to-day operating environment that CEOs live. Both CEOs and VCs know that I don’t bring an agenda when sharing my point of view. So if there is a difference of views, I can be a neutral third party who has sat in both of their seats. Also, given I don’t take Board seats, CEOs often feel comfortable previewing things they want to discuss with their Board/VCs, and I can pressure test their thinking before they go into the Board meeting.I think it’s key, though, not to force advice. I have regular dialogues with the CEOs I work with, but it’s on their terms and timeframes.I can also be very helpful in team building, which is critical at the early stages since it sets the DNA of the company. At Ten-X, for example, I recruited Board members like Kevin Johnson, the newly named CEO of Starbucks, and advisors like Deep Nishar, the longtime SVP of Product at Linkedin.Hiring people out of top companies is often the trickiest because you’re trying to do the work of separating the individual’s specific contribution from the momentum of the company they’ve been a part of. I can support the CEO to figure out if the candidate is the right person to help them solve what they specifically need to be solved.Beyond real estate, what are some other areas that you are excited about investing in?Fintech is an interesting segment and a natural extension of the real estate focus. I’ve invested in mortgage, specialty finance and payment related companies.Vertical SaaS is also interesting: The notion that industries that didn’t adopt software in the old, on-premise model, are now adopting software for the first time. Look at Dealertrack — they recently got acquired for $4 billion. Twelve-plus years ago, VCs wouldn’t have thought about building a business around selling software to auto dealers. SaaS enables rapid growth in verticals, and there are other segments that are going to get opened up and have first order opportunities.Machine learning is another key trend. I view it as almost a fundamental architecture change, and when that happens, you can rethink key software segments: SFA, CRM, customer support, HR, etc. to be architected with machine learning from the ground up.Fintech and machine learning may seem overhyped, but because they impact trillion-dollar-plus markets, I view us as being in the early innings of a multi-decade transformation. Amazon, for example, was started almost 25 years ago, and you still have multi-billion dollar exits from innovative e-commerce companies.Where is this headed for you as an investor when you look ahead at your trajectory? Where do you think the VC model is headed?I started venture investing in 2000, and the venture model, industry, and competitive dynamics have changed a lot since then. Venture has disrupted itself, in some ways. What AngelList is doing is very innovative, and it has had its influence on the market.I think the key dynamic that I see changing is that companies, both consumer and B2B, will look cross-border sooner versus later. Lightspeed was very early in China, and it was almost like silos: There were China companies, and there were US companies, and the two worlds didn’t interact. As we look forward, those silos disintegrate, and companies on each side of the ocean take advantage of not only their home market but the other big market. I think that trend only grows more pervasive going forward: Investors with cross-border expertise and resources will start to differentiate themselves.As for myself, it sounds trite, but I’m passionate about working with great teams who want to change the world. I think that’s a lot of fun. So my plan is to continue investing, and AngelList is a great platform for doing that.To invest in Jake Seid’s syndicate, visit: https://angel.co/jake-seid-1/syndicateOriginally published at blog.angel.co on March 20, 2017.Share2Never miss a story from AngelList Blog, when you sign up for Medium.

Today’s biggest returns are going to early investors in private companies, especially high-growth technology companies that are changing nearly every aspect of life. Rather than wait for a company to go public, often at a high price, OurCrowd’s equity crowdfunding platform allows investors exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000.

	The graph below shows how the days of seeing 600% returns in public technology companies are largely over, with such opportunities confined to private investments.

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
