Our Products
 














Enoxaparin Sodium Injection







Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is the generic equivalent to Lovenox® indicated for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis, which may lead to pulmonary embolism and the inpatient/outpatient treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (see Enoxaparin Sodium Injection Full Prescribing Information). Enoxaparin is available in prefilled syringes with UltraSafe® Needle Guard making it fully compliant with the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. Amphastar's Enoxaparin is available in seven dosage forms.












Cortrosyn® (cosyntropin for Injection) is a diagnostic agent used in the screening of patients presumed to have adrenocortocal insufficiency. With Cortrosyn's rapid effect on the adrenal cortex, it may be utilized to perform a 30-minute test of adrenal function (plasma cortisol response) as an office or outpatient procedure requiring only two venipunctures (see Cortrosyn® Professional Prescribing Information).
 


Cortrosyn®








Amphadase® (hyaluronidase injection, USP)










Amphadase® (hyaluronidase injection, USP) is an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid in connective tissue, increasing tissue permeability. Hyaluronidase is typically used as an adjunctive agent to facilitate the dispersion and absorption of other drugs. It is used in local anesthesia to increase the area affected and speed the onset of action, especially in nerve-block anesthesia and anesthesia prior to ophthalmic surgery (see Amphadase® Professional Prescribing Information).
 
 








Ketoroloc Tromethamine Injection, USP






Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is indicated for the short-term (up to 5 days in adults) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting.








Emergency Syringes in Luer-Jet™







Amphastar’s subsidiary, International Medication System, Ltd. (IMS), utilizes the proprietary prefilled disposable emergency syringes for
crash cart use. Emergency syringes are provided in the Luer-Jet™;
a completely needleless, Luer Lock syringe. Luer-Jet™ complies with OSHA's Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, and is compatible with most Luer Activated Systems (including ICU Medical Clave® Valve).
 
• Atropine Sulfate Injection, USP
• Calcium Chloride Injection, USP
• Dextrose Injection, USP
• Epinephrine Injection, USP
• Lidocaine HCI Injection, USP
• Sodium Bicarbonate Injection, USP









Lidocaine












 
 
• Lidocaine HCl Jelly, USP, 2% (Preservative Free), URO-Jet® is    a preservative-free topical local anesthetic agent and is provided    in the uniquely designed Uro-Jet prefilled syringe, which is specially    designed to reduce discomfort during the product application.
 
 
 
 
• Lidocaine HCl, 4% Topical Solution, USP-Laryng-O-Jet® is    indicated for the topical anesthesia of the respiratory tract. It is    provided in the Laryng-O-Jet prefilled syringe, which is designed to    reduce discomfort during product application.










Naloxone








Naloxone HCl Injection, USP, 2mg/2mL:
Naloxone HCl Injection is indicated for the complete or partial reversal of narcotic depression and diagnosis of suspected acute opioid overdose.
 
Provided in 2 types of prefilled syringes for convenient, safe, and quick Intravenous, Intramuscular, and Subcutaneous administration:
 
• Needleless Luer Jet Prefilled Syringe: completely needleless      syringe, provided in Luer Lock syringe, complies with OSHA's    Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. Compatible with most
   Luer Activated Systems (includes ICU Medical Clave® Valve)
 
• Min-I-Jet Prefilled syringe with 21 Gauge and 1 ½” fixed Needle










Phytonadione Injection







Phytonadione Injection (Vitamin K1) for newborns has been on the market for many years. Recently, however, with the trend moving towards safe needle technology, IMS has combined its product’s configuration with the Saf-T-Jet™ prefilled syringe, which complies with the Needlestick and Safety Prevention Act.

	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling technically-challenging generic and branded injectable and inhalation products.  We currently manufacture and sell 15 products in the U.S. and are developing a portfolio of 13 generic and 7 branded injectable and inhalation products that primarily target markets with high technical barriers to entry.

Our largest product by net revenues is enoxaparin sodium injection, the generic equivalent of Sanofi’s Lovenox.  Enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant, which helps prevent the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, commonly referred to as deep vein thrombosis. Enoxaparin is difficult to produce because the API is not easily obtained or manufactured. We manufacture the API for our enoxaparin product and perform all other manufacturing of the finished product in-house. We believe that our enoxaparin product not only demonstrates our scientific capabilities of developing therapeutically equivalent generic versions of drugs with large, complex molecules and overcoming numerous regulatory hurdles, but it also demonstrates our capabilities in characterizing complex molecules.

	Our multiple technological capabilities enable the development of technically-challenging products.  These capabilities include characterizing complex molecules, analyzing peptides, proteins and DNA, conducting immunogenicity studies, engineering particles and improving drug delivery through sustained release technology.  These technological capabilities have enabled us to produce bioequivalent versions of complex drugs and support the development and manufacture of a broad range of dosage formulations, including solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and lyophilized products, as well as products administered via metered dose inhalers, or MDIs, and dry powder inhalers, or DPIs.

	Our primary focus is developing products for markets with high technical barriers to entry.  We are specifically focused on applying our technical expertise to develop products that:



			leverage our research and development capabilities;



			require raw materials or an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for which we believe we have a competitive advantage in sourcing, synthesizing or manufacturing; and/or



			improve upon an existing drug’s formulation with respect to drug delivery, safety and/or efficiency.



To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made numerous strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies that collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure, including providing additional manufacturing, marketing and research and development capabilities and the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products.

	We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling technically-challenging generic and branded injectable and inhalation products.  We currently manufacture and sell 15 products in the U.S. and are developing a portfolio of 13 generic and 7 branded injectable and inhalation products that primarily target markets with high technical barriers to entry.

Our largest product by net revenues is enoxaparin sodium injection, the generic equivalent of Sanofi’s Lovenox.  Enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant, which helps prevent the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, commonly referred to as deep vein thrombosis. Enoxaparin is difficult to produce because the API is not easily obtained or manufactured. We manufacture the API for our enoxaparin product and perform all other manufacturing of the finished product in-house. We believe that our enoxaparin product not only demonstrates our scientific capabilities of developing therapeutically equivalent generic versions of drugs with large, complex molecules and overcoming numerous regulatory hurdles, but it also demonstrates our capabilities in characterizing complex molecules.

	Our multiple technological capabilities enable the development of technically-challenging products.  These capabilities include characterizing complex molecules, analyzing peptides, proteins and DNA, conducting immunogenicity studies, engineering particles and improving drug delivery through sustained release technology.  These technological capabilities have enabled us to produce bioequivalent versions of complex drugs and support the development and manufacture of a broad range of dosage formulations, including solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and lyophilized products, as well as products administered via metered dose inhalers, or MDIs, and dry powder inhalers, or DPIs.

	Our primary focus is developing products for markets with high technical barriers to entry.  We are specifically focused on applying our technical expertise to develop products that:



			leverage our research and development capabilities;



			require raw materials or an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for which we believe we have a competitive advantage in sourcing, synthesizing or manufacturing; and/or



			improve upon an existing drug’s formulation with respect to drug delivery, safety and/or efficiency.



To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made numerous strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies that collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure, including providing additional manufacturing, marketing and research and development capabilities and the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
