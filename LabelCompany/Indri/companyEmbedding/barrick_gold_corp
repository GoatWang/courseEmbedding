Beware of False Recruitment Offers
We have recently become aware of  attempts by individuals in India to solicit personal information. People behind  the website and e-mail domain barrickinc.com have been falsely representing  that they are associated with Barrick. Please be advised that these individuals  do not represent Barrick, and are in no way part of the Barrick organization or  otherwise associated with Barrick.
We urge job applicants to  carefully check and confirm the credentials of any person or organization that  represents itself as being part of the Barrick organization or otherwise associated  with Barrick before responding to any advertisements or e-mail solicitations. 
We further urge job applicants to  critically assess requests made by any such recruiters. Unusual requests for  personal information and/or credentials, for example passport or banking  information, may be a sign that such recruiters are not engaged in a legitimate  business activity.
Barrick career opportunities are  advertised on jobs.barrick.com. Job seekers can view and apply for openings  with Barrick directly on our website.

Notice to recruitment, staffing and temporary/labour hire firms

Barrick Gold Corporation will not pay any fees for recruitment activities related to the hiring of a candidate unless a written professional services agreement has been established between a duly authorized representative of the Corporate, Regional or Mine Site Recruitment department of Barrick Gold Corporation and the recruitment/staffing firm.

DRIP
Shareholders who are residents of Canada or the United States may elect to participate in the dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") commencing with the dividend to be paid on September 15, 2015 to shareholders on record as of August 31, 2015. Participation in the Plan is optional and will not affect shareholders' cash dividends unless they elect to participate in the Plan. Quarterly dividends are only payable as and when declared by Barrick's Board of Directors and there is no entitlement to any dividend prior thereto.
Dividend Reinvestment Plan (PDF)Enrolment Form (PDF)
 
Eligible Dividends
Pursuant to recently enacted tax legislation, Canadian resident individuals who receive "eligible dividends" in 2006 and subsequent years will be entitled to an enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit on such dividends. Barrick has designated that all dividends paid in 2006 and subsequent years by Barrick Gold Corporation and Barrick Gold Inc. (on the exchangeable shares) are "eligible dividends" for these purposes.

Premier assets, profitable production





Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold in 2016 from a portfolio that includes some of the world’s premier gold assets.
Our five core mines in the Americas are expected to account for about 70% of our total production in 2017, at a cost of sales applicable to gold of $770-$810 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs of $650-$710 per ounce1. With an average reserve grade of 1.84 grams per tonne2—more than double that of our peer group average—they are among the most attractive assets in the entire gold industry.
Copper production in 2016 was 415 million pounds.

"“All-in sustaining costs” per ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. “All-in sustaining costs” per ounce begins with cost of sales less, among other items, the impact of depreciation, and adds further costs which reflect the additional costs of operating a mine, primarily sustaining capital expenditures, general & administrative costs, and minesite exploration and evaluation costs. Barrick believes that the use of “all-in sustaining costs” per ounce will assist investors, analysts, and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations, and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. “All-in sustaining costs” per ounce is intended to provide additional information only, and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Although a standardized definition of “all-in sustaining costs” was published in 2013 by the World Gold Council (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by 18 gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick), it is not a regulatory organization, and other companies may calculate this measure differently.

“All-in sustaining costs” per pound is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. “All-in sustaining costs” per pound begins with “C1 cash costs” per pound and adds further costs which reflect the additional costs of operating a mine, primarily sustaining capital expenditures, general & administrative costs and royalties. Barrick believes that the use of “all-in sustaining costs” per pound will assist investors, analysts, and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing copper, understanding the economics of copper mining, assessing our operating performance, and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis.

About Barrick Gold Corporation






Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining—wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner.
Our ultimate objective is to grow our free cash flow per share over the long term. We will do so by: maintaining and growing industry-leading margins, driven by innovation and our digital transformation; managing our portfolio and allocating capital with discipline and rigor; and leveraging our distinctive partnership culture as a competitive advantage.
More than 75% of our gold production comes from the Americas region, including Argentina, Canada, Dominican Republic, Peru and the United States. The Company also has mining operations and projects in Australia, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, and Zambia.  At the end of 2016, Barrick had proven and probable gold reserves of 85.9 million ounces (2.0 billion tonnes, grading 1.33 grams per tonne).





A Company of Owners





Disciplined Capital Allocation





Focus on Talent Management




We aim to cultivate a high-performance culture defined by the following principles: a deep commitment to partnership, consistent execution, operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation, and continual self-improvement. We are obsessed with talent, and seek out fresh perspectives from other industries, challenging ourselves to think differently as we transform Barrick into a leading 21st century company.
We are guided by John Templeton’s words, "If you want superior performance, you must be different." We agree. It is part of Barrick’s DNA to be intentionally different. Today we are embodying that DNA in a way that is all the more relevant by embracing innovation and making the best use of technology and data, embedding it into every fiber of our business. This will make us faster, safer, and more efficient, and will allow us to be more transparent with our partners than ever before. In the end, we want to be among the very best 21st century companies, not just in our industry, but in any industry.
Barrick was founded in 1983 by Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Munk, and is headquartered in Toronto. The Company’s shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ABX.

Production and Cost Outlook
For 2017, we expect to produce 5.3-5.6 million ounces of gold at a cost of sales of $780-$820 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $720-$770 per ounce. Copper production guidance is 400-450 million pounds, at a cost of sales of $1.50-$1.70 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs2 of $2.10-$2.40 per pound.



More on production and cost outlook

We produced 5.52 million ounces of gold in 2016, at a cost of sales of $798 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $730 per ounce.
Our five core mines in the Americas are expected to account for about 70% of our total production in 2017, at a cost of sales applicable to gold of $770-$810 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $650-$710 per ounce. With an average reserve grade of 1.84 grams per tonne—more than double that of our peer group average—they are among the most attractive assets in the entire gold industry.

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]
Operations[edit]
Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]

Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]
Operations[edit]
Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]
Operations[edit]
Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]

Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]

In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

About Barrick Gold Corporation






Our vision is the generation of wealth through responsible mining—wealth for our owners, our people, and the countries and communities with which we partner.
Our ultimate objective is to grow our free cash flow per share over the long term. We will do so by: maintaining and growing industry-leading margins, driven by innovation and our digital transformation; managing our portfolio and allocating capital with discipline and rigor; and leveraging our distinctive partnership culture as a competitive advantage.
More than 75% of our gold production comes from the Americas region, including Argentina, Canada, Dominican Republic, Peru and the United States. The Company also has mining operations and projects in Australia, Chile, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, and Zambia.  At the end of 2016, Barrick had proven and probable gold reserves of 85.9 million ounces (2.0 billion tonnes, grading 1.33 grams per tonne).





A Company of Owners





Disciplined Capital Allocation





Focus on Talent Management




We aim to cultivate a high-performance culture defined by the following principles: a deep commitment to partnership, consistent execution, operational excellence, disciplined capital allocation, and continual self-improvement. We are obsessed with talent, and seek out fresh perspectives from other industries, challenging ourselves to think differently as we transform Barrick into a leading 21st century company.
We are guided by John Templeton’s words, "If you want superior performance, you must be different." We agree. It is part of Barrick’s DNA to be intentionally different. Today we are embodying that DNA in a way that is all the more relevant by embracing innovation and making the best use of technology and data, embedding it into every fiber of our business. This will make us faster, safer, and more efficient, and will allow us to be more transparent with our partners than ever before. In the end, we want to be among the very best 21st century companies, not just in our industry, but in any industry.
Barrick was founded in 1983 by Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist Peter Munk, and is headquartered in Toronto. The Company’s shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ABX.
2017 Priorities



Maximize Free Cash FlowGenerate free cash flow at $1,000/oz



Disciplined InvestmentOptimize portfolio, progress Frontera district, advance projects and exploration



Balance SheetReduce total debt to $5 billion by end of 2018, targeting $1.5 billion reduction in 2017



Operational ExcellenceUnify Nevada, embed and accelerate digital transformation and innovation



Talent DevelopmentUpgrade talent and develop next generation of industry leaders



Production and Cost Outlook
For 2017, we expect to produce 5.3-5.6 million ounces of gold at a cost of sales of $780-$820 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $720-$770 per ounce. Copper production guidance is 400-450 million pounds, at a cost of sales of $1.50-$1.70 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs2 of $2.10-$2.40 per pound.



More on production and cost outlook

We produced 5.52 million ounces of gold in 2016, at a cost of sales of $798 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $730 per ounce.
Our five core mines in the Americas are expected to account for about 70% of our total production in 2017, at a cost of sales applicable to gold of $770-$810 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $650-$710 per ounce. With an average reserve grade of 1.84 grams per tonne—more than double that of our peer group average—they are among the most attractive assets in the entire gold industry.
Our gold production guidance for 2018 is 4.8-5.3 million ounces, at a cost of sales of $790-$840 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $710-$770 per ounce. For 2019, our gold production guidance is 4.6-5.1 million ounces, at a cost of sales of $800-$870 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs1 of $700-$770 per ounce.

Footnotes


“All-in sustaining costs” per ounce of gold is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. “All-in sustaining costs” per ounce begins with cost of sales less, among other items, the impact of depreciation, and adds further costs which reflect the additional costs of operating a mine, primarily sustaining capital expenditures, general & administrative costs, and minesite exploration and evaluation costs. Barrick believes that the use of “all-in sustaining costs” per ounce will assist investors, analysts, and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations, and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. “All-in sustaining costs” per ounce is intended to provide additional information only, and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Although a standardized definition of “all-in sustaining costs” was published in 2013 by the World Gold Council (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by 18 gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick), it is not a regulatory organization, and other companies may calculate this measure differently. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Further details on this non-GAAP measure are provided in the MD&A accompanying Barrick’s financial statements filed from time to time on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.


“All-in sustaining costs” per pound is a non-GAAP financial performance measure. “All-in sustaining costs” per pound begins with “C1 cash costs” per pound and adds further costs which reflect the additional costs of operating a mine, primarily sustaining capital expenditures, general & administrative costs and royalties. Barrick believes that the use of “all-in sustaining costs” per pound will assist investors, analysts, and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing copper, understanding the economics of copper mining, assessing our operating performance, and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis. "All-in sustaining costs" per pound is intended to provide additional information only, does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS, and may not be comparable to similar measures of performance presented by other companies. This measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Further details on these non-GAAP measures are provided in the MD&A accompanying Barrick's financial statements filed from time to time on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov.


Estimated in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 as required by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. Estimates are as of December 31, 2016, unless otherwise noted. Complete mineral reserve and mineral resource data for all mines and projects referenced on this website, including tonnes, grades, and ounces, can be found on pages 88-93 of Barrick’s Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Report.

Canada's main stock index fell on Monday, as gold miners broadly weighed and Barrick Gold Corp lost nearly 5 percent after a company it majority owns, Acacia Mining, was hit with a bill for $190 billion in unpaid taxes in Tanzania.

Railway stocks, big banks and pipeline and other energy stocks also put pressure on the index, which unlike most major global stock indices is trading lower than where it ended 2016. 
The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.4 percent, with the global gold sub-index down 2.3 percent even as bullion hit a one-month high.
"One of the reasons we don't invest in gold stocks is because the commodity can do well or poorly, but the companies themselves all have things going on that can negate any gains," said Norman Levine, managing director at Portfolio Management Corp.
Barrick ended down 4.9 percent at C$19.29 in the wake of the Tanzania tax bill for Acacia. 
Levine said the stronger Canadian dollar, which breached 80 U.S. cents during the session, also weighed on Canadian natural resource stocks whose products are priced in the greenback.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index ended down 54.44 points, or 0.36 percent, at 15,128.69. Eight of its 10 main groups finished in the red.
The energy sector slipped 0.2 percent despite oil prices jumping after Saudi Arabia said it would cut its crude exports, with Enbridge Inc down 0.4 percent at C$52.17. [O/R]
Industrials fell 0.7 percent, with Canadian National Railway Co down 1.2 percent and rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd falling 1.8 percent to C$199.69.
Toronto Dominion Bank was among the biggest drags on the index, down 0.5 percent at C$65.02, while Royal Bank of Canada also slipped, off 0.2 percent at C$93.67. 
The financials group, which accounts for about 30 percent of the index's weighting, slipped 0.2 percent.
Consumer-related shares added to the general weakness on the Toronto market, including grocer Loblaw, which declined 0.8 percent to C$70.8, and pharmacy chain Alimentation Couche-Tard, which slipped 0.7 percent to C$59.83.

PRESIDENT John Magufuli has demanded Barrick Gold Corporation Chairman, Prof John Thornton to honour his pledge of coming to the negotiation table with the government on how they will compensate Tanzania over mineral concentrates or risk closure of the mines.
Addressing a public rally at Kakonko in Kigoma, Dr Magufuli said should they fail to show up at the discussion table over the mineral saga; their mines will be given to locals so that they can pay revenue to the government.








The President, who is on an official tour of Kigoma Region, gave the ultimatum when laying a foundation stone for the construction of a 50-kilomtre Kibondo-Nyakanazi tarmac road.
Prof Thornton, Chairman of the parent company of Acacia Mining jetted into the country in June, this year and met President Magufuli to discuss the mineral sand saga and he agree to dispatch his team to the country who will meet with that of the government and jointly discuss the mine sand report findings and pay all losses the country incurred.
Barrick Gold Canada is the largest shareholder of Acacia Mining Company with 64 per cent stake. On March, 2017 the export of the mineral concentrates from Tanzania was stopped through a Presidential directive.

"Acacia Mining must meet so that we discuss on how they will settle a festering dispute over taxes, royalties and exports, for the country to enjoy the mineral blessings for economic wellbeing," he cautioned.


He said that he has poured all weight over the issue, thus if there is anything bad that will happen, then he will face it for the sake of Tanzanians. "If we were getting our real share from mineral ore exportation, there would be no complaints over food shortages.
This is an economic war, which we should stand together regardless of our political affiliation," he said A government audit of Acacia found that it had 10 times more gold in containers prepared for export than it had declared and that the concentrates included a number of undeclared minerals.
He commended parliamentarians for having joined hands in support of government efforts to ensure that bad mining laws are amended for national interest.










President Magufuli on the other hand assured residents in that area that he has directed the responsible minister to visit the area and see how best to address the water shortage.
He used the occasion to remind Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) members to be keen in their elections and anyone found to have been involved in corruption then his/her name will be deleted from the list of contestants.
Mr Magufuli wants to reform the country's mining industry, an important source of foreign exchange and has launched audits of the sector, which accounts for 4 per cent of Tanzania's gross domestic product (GDP).

Barrick Gold Corp.: Buy or Sell?

Demetris Afxentiou | July 24, 2017 | More on:  ABX ABX








 




The gold market of 2017 is beginning to resemble a roller coaster again.

While, overall, precious metals have seen steady gains in 2017 following the incredible run up in 2016, precious metal producers such as Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX)(NYSE:ABX) have split from following the run up in gold prices and have actually dropped.

Barrick’s stock price has retreated nearly 5% year to date. Over the course of the past 12-month period, that drop is an even more concerning 20%.

That?s not to say that Barrick hasn?t performed well over the past few years. The company?s efforts to improve efficiency and slash costs…

The gold market of 2017 is beginning to resemble a roller coaster again.
While, overall, precious metals have seen steady gains in 2017 following the incredible run up in 2016, precious metal producers such as Barrick Gold Corp. (TSX:ABX)(NYSE:ABX) have split from following the run up in gold prices and have actually dropped.
Barrick’s stock price has retreated nearly 5% year to date. Over the course of the past 12-month period, that drop is an even more concerning 20%.
That’s not to say that Barrick hasn’t performed well over the past few years. The company’s efforts to improve efficiency and slash costs have seen the company go from US$13 billion in debt and high costs to just US$8 billion in debt. Barrick has achieved one of the most efficient operations in the business in a little over two years.
The company has even mentioned the prospect of being completely debt-free within a decade.
As impressive as these developments have been, Barrick’s recent drop is more to do with the company missing on Q1 results, which were exasperated by Barrick calling for lower production at its Veradero mine in Argentina.
While Barrick can and will weather this temporary storm, there is downward pressure on the stock, which is also weakened by the current environment in the gold market.
What happened to the gold market?
The current woes in the gold market aren’t limited to Barrick. On a macro basis, nearly all producers are feeling a pullback in prices which is due to a variety of factors.
Historically, gold has been viewed as a safe store of wealth. This view is being reconsidered by investors that aren’t attached to gold itself but rather the opportunity that it represents.
The reason that gold was a safe store of wealth was that it was (and still is) rare, in high demand, and has a steadily increasing price. The more investors purchased it, the higher the price went.
Turning to more recent events, there are several developments that are bringing into question that long established view. Crypto-currencies, such as Bitcoin, are now challenging the safe-store-of-wealth and increasing-value viewpoints. Bitcoin has surged this year, more than doubling in value year over year with no end in sight. For the more connected investors, the returns on crypto-currencies are too good to ignore.
Another point worth considering is interest rates. The U.S. Fed has already raised rates this year, and now Canada has followed suit. Industry experts speculate that one more hike in the U.S. is likely later this year. Given the roller coaster of a ride that gold has been on in recent years, some investors may start to reconsider their precious metal investment in lieu of another that is appreciative of the changes underway in the economy.
Is Barrick a good investment?
Barrick’s production woes will be resolved, and the company will return to higher production later this year. Barrick’s efforts at slashing away debt will also continue to make strides and place the company in a much better standing over time. The stock may continue to drop before those improvements take place.
In my opinion, investors looking to buy into Barrick may soon see an opportunity to do so at a discounted rate, whereas existing shareholders should wait out the current storm.

Canada's answer to Amazon.com
You've probably never even heard of this up-and-coming e-commerce powerhouse headquartered in Eastern Ontario...
But, despite coming public just last year, it's already helping the likes of Budweiser... Tesla... Subway... and Red Bull move $9.9 BILLION (and counting) worth of goods online each year.
And now it's caught the eye of the legendary investor who got behind Amazon.com in 1997 -- just before it shot up over 23,000% and made investors like you and me rich beyond their wildest dreams.
Click here to discover why this investor says it's time to buy.
 



Fool contributor Demetris Afxentiou has no position in any stocks mentioned. 






NEW! This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon In 1997

For only the 5th time in over 14 years, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner just issued a Buy Recommendation on this recent Canadian IPO. 
Stock Advisor Canada’s Chief Investment Adviser, Iain Butler, also recommended this company back in March – and it’s already up a whopping 57%!

Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Goldcorp-Barrick Partnership Shows Miners Tip-Toeing to Growth

                Canada’s two biggest gold miners team up in Chilean venture
            



                Goldcorp shares fall most since November after deals announced
            













Goldcorp CEO Says Project Pipeline Quite Full Right Now




In the dark days of the commodities meltdown, mining companies turned to partnerships to lower costs and survive. Now, as prices recover, they’re hooking up for growth -- or at least the possibility of it.Canada’s two biggest gold miners, Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc., are teaming up to develop a gold-copper deposit in Chile as part of a complex chain of transactions.The cultures of the two companies are, in many ways, opposites. Where Goldcorp has been focused on boosting production, Barrick has repeatedly stressed that its priority is improving cash flow through better margins.




Barrick’s latest joint venture with Goldcorp means it’s off the hook for the initial development costs associated with a large project in the Maricunga mineral belt, in exchange for handing over control of part of the asset.Under terms of separate deals announced Tuesday, Goldcorp will acquire 25 percent of the Barrick-controlled Cerro Casale project in Chile. Goldcorp will also buy Kinross Gold Corp.’s 25 percent total interest in the deposit for $260 million upfront, as well as other deferred payments and a royalty, making Barrick and Goldcorp equal partners at the site.Meanwhile, through the acquisition of Exeter Resource Corp., Goldcorp will buy the Caspiche project just 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from Cerro Casale, adding it to the new venture’s project mix.‘Long Time’By combining Cerro Casale and Caspiche, Goldcorp believes it can reduce the capital burden to develop the area and eventually generate a better return, Chief Executive Officer David Garofalo said in an interview.“It will be a long time before we put a shovel in the ground on these properties,” Garofalo said Tuesday by phone. “But if we don’t tuck them into our portfolios and advance them, we’re never going to get them to a point where we actually can make an investment case.”




Goldcorp fell 6 percent to C$20.16 at 1:15 p.m. in Toronto, after tumbling 6.3 percent, the biggest intraday drop since Nov. 10. Barrick declined 1.7 percent and Kinross was down 2.5 percent.Miners are wading back into the deal pool following years of austerity that staunched investments in future production. Exploration budgets are rising and miners are looking to acquire assets through partnerships or outright purchases. Goldcorp will continue to look for opportunities, Garofalo said in the interview Tuesday, although he noted that large deposits are increasingly difficult to find.  “I’d dearly love to buy more of them. They’re just not available. And I’d certainly love to do more of these collaborate deals with pure companies like Barrick,” Garofalo said. “We’re talking to all of our peers about these types of transactions because the industry has been suffering a downward trajectory in its reserves for five years now.”Gaining ‘Optionality’Goldcorp will spend $260 million toward Barrick’s portion of the initial development costs over five years, $85 million of which will be covered by giving Barrick half of Caspiche once that deal closes and it’s added to the asset.From Barrick’s perspective, this moves development of the deposit forward at no additional cost to its shareholders, President Kelvin Dushnisky said in a statement. “This agreement will allow us to direct capital elsewhere in our portfolio, while ensuring shareholders retain exposure to the optionality associated with one of the largest undeveloped gold and copper deposits in the world.”The deal is “strategically neutral” for Barrick, Andrew Quail, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a research note, but could be positive insofar as it represents a move toward risk-sharing among large miners, he said.Dushnisky and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton have said they would consider partnerships as a way of developing assets in Chile and elsewhere. In 2015, Barrick agreed to sell a 50 percent interest in its Zaldivar copper mine in Chile to Antofagasta Plc for $1.01 billion.









Barrick CEO discusses deal strategy in February interviewFor Goldcorp, the announcements Tuesday are a “slight strategic negative,” Quail wrote. “We believe this transaction highlights the company’s lack of large-scale organic growth projects when compared to its peers” such as Barrick and Newmont Mining Corp., he wrote.As part of its deal with Kinross, Goldcorp will also acquire 100 percent of Kinross’s interest in the Quebrada Seca exploration project adjacent to Cerro Casale and will give Barrick a royalty interest on gross revenues derived from both projects.Click here for details on today’s transactionsGoldcorp has joint ventures with Barrick at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic and with Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd. at the NuevaUnion project in Chile. Last year Goldcorp bought Canadian explorer Kaminak Gold Corp. in a C$520 million share swap.“Particularly in Chile and Peru, it makes sense to work in mining clusters where operations can join to share infrastructure,” Cesar Perez-Novoa, an analyst with BTG Pactual, said by telephone from Santiago. “I see a trend of partnerships happening over the coming decade.”— With assistance by Laura Millan Lombrana, and Aoyon Ashraf

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]
Operations[edit]
Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]
Operations[edit]
Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

Barrick Gold Corporation is the largest gold mining company in the world, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.[1] Barrick is currently undertaking mining projects in Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Saudi Arabia, the United States and Zambia.[2] For 2013, it produced 7.2 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US $915/ounce and 539 million pounds of copper at C1 cash costs of $1.92/pound. As of December 31, 2013, its proven and probable mineral reserves were 104.1 million ounces (3250 U.S. tons) of gold, 888 million ounces of silver contained within gold reserves, and 14.0 billion pounds of copper.
On January 20, 2006, Barrick acquired a majority share of Placer Dome. The production of the combined organization moved Barrick to its current position as the largest gold producer, ahead of Newmont Mining Corporation.
In 2016 Barrick produced 5.52 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $730 per ounce. Copper production for the year totaled 415 million pounds at all-in sustaining cash costs of $2.05 per pound. [3]
In Q1 2017 Barrick generated US$1.99 billion in revenue and produced 1.31 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $772 per ounce. [4]

History[edit]
Founding and early years[edit]
Barrick Gold Corporation evolved from a privately held North American oil and gas company,[5] Barrick Resources.[6] After suffering huge financial losses in oil and gas,[7] principal Peter Munk decided to focus on gold.[8] Barrick Resources Corporation became a publicly traded company on May 2, 1983,[9] listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.[10]
The company’s first acquisition was the Renabie mine, near Wawa, Ontario,[11] which produced around 16,000 troy ounces (0.50 t) of gold in 1984,[12] but its best year was 1990 with 48,000 ounces produced.[13] In 1984, Barrick acquired Camflo Mining,[14] which had operations in the province of Quebec[12] and in the U.S. state of Nevada.[15] Barrick’s effort to purchase was slowed by skepticism the company could assume Camflo’s debt of around $100 million.[16] The sale was finalized in May 1984, with terms that obligated Barrick to repay the debt to The Royal Bank of Canada within one year.[17] The debt was fully paid in January 1985.[18]
Barrick Resource’s next acquisition was the Mercur mine in Mercur, Utah, in June 1985,[19] followed by the Goldstrike mine, in Nevada, in 1986.[20] The Goldstrike mine is located on the Carlin Trend.
1986 to 2005[edit]
The company’s name was changed to American Barrick Resources in 1986.[21] It was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in February 1987.[22] The name was changed to the present Barrick Gold Corporation in 1995.[23]
In a 1994 friendly takeover, American Barrick became the third largest gold mining company in the world when it acquired the Canadian mining company Lac Minerals, which owned properties in North and South America.[24] Two years later, in 1996, Arequipa Resources, owner of properties including the Pierina mine in Peru, accepted a takeover offer from the renamed Barrick Gold Corporation, worth about USD $800,000,000.[25] A third acquisition followed in early 1999, when Barrick Gold acquired Sutton Resources Ltd. for around $350 million in stock, assuming ownership of properties in Tanzania.[26] In 2001 Barrick Gold made another stock deal, worth about USD $2.3 billion, to buy the Homestake Mining Company, then one of the oldest mining companies in the United States.[27] The purchase moved Barrick to second largest gold producer in the world.[27]
Placer Dome acquisition[edit]
The company offered US $9.2 billion for Placer Dome Inc. in a bid announced October 31, 2005.[28] During the following weeks, Placer Dome recommended shareholders reject the offer.[29] In December, Placer Dome’s board of directors approved an increased offer worth US $10.4 billion.[30] The transaction closed in early 2006, making Barrick the world’s largest gold producer.[31]
2006 to present[edit]
On July 24, 2006, Barrick announced their intent to purchase NovaGold Resources and Pioneer Metals. The unsolicited bid for NovaGold Resources was at US $1.29 billion or US $14.50 per share, and the solicited bid for Pioneer Metals was at US $53 million or US $.88 per share. NovaGold management quickly characterized Barrick's bid for their company as undervalued. Pioneer management however quickly endorsed Barrick's bid for their company. Previously on June 19, 2006, NovaGold made an unsolicited bid for Pioneer Metals at US $31 million. NovaGold and Pioneer are currently in litigation over the Grace project in British Columbia, Canada. That project is adjacent to NovaGold's Galore Creek project and 75 kilometers away from Barrick's Eskay Creek mine. NovaGold and Barrick also cross paths at the Donlin Creek project in Alaska where NovaGold is 70% owner and Barrick is 30% owner, however Barrick has the right to earn in a 70% share as a result of their takeover of Placer Dome in January 2006.
On August 14, 2006, NovaGold filed a lawsuit in British Columbia, Canada, alleging that Barrick misused confidential information to make its bid for Pioneer metals. As part of the suit, NovaGold is asking that any shares tendered to Barrick under the Pioneer bid be held in a trust for NovaGold. On August 25, 2006, NovaGold filed a second lawsuit against Barrick – this time in the District of Alaska court alleging that Barrick violated U.S. security laws by misrepresenting its position by repeatedly stating it is on-track to earn a 70% interest in the Donlin Creek mine. The suit sought a temporary suspension of Barrick's hostile bid for NovaGold.
On December 16, 2006, after extending the bid for NovaGold 6 times, increasing the offer once, and lowering the threshold for takeup of tendered shares from 75% to 50%, and then to no minimum, Barrick finally let the bid expire. The net result for Barrick was a takeup of 12.7% of the outstanding NovaGold shares. Barrick's then Chief Executive Greg Wilkins indicated that the company would look elsewhere for acquisition opportunities. More recently, the company was reported to be eyeing Aurelian Resources in Ecuador.[32]
In November 2007, NovaGold and Teck Cominco announced the suspension of Galore Creek project and Nova Gold share plummeted. During the summer and Autumn of 2008, Nova Gold tried to put their Rock Creek project in Alaska into production. After less than two months of operation, production was shut down for obscure reasons. On January 2, 2009, Nova Gold announced a 60 million dollar private placement for a 30% control in the company, valuing the company at approximately 200 million dollars, or 1/8 of the price offered by Barrick two years earlier.[33]
Through 2007 and 2008 the company offered a USD $10 million prize to the scientific community in a bid to improve silver recovery rates at its Veladero mine in Argentina.[34] Recovery rates for silver were below 7%, because the metal is bound within silica, which is difficult to dissolve using conventional cyanidation processing.[34] 1,750 researchers from 43 countries registered as participants with 130 proposals submitted.[35] Nine proposals were selected for testing.[36]
Barrick Gold created the largest stock offering in Canadian history during 2009,[37] when it issued a $3 billion equity offering, which was increased the following day to $3.5 billion in response to market demand.[38] Revenue from the offering was used to eliminate the company’s gold hedges, which locked in the sale price of future production, rather than selling it at market prices.[39]
In February 2010, Barrick Gold announced plans to create a separate company to hold its assets in Tanzania, called African Barrick Gold.[40] Barrick Gold would retain majority ownership in the new company, after its listing on the London Stock Exchange.[40] African Barrick Gold was listed on the London Stock Exchange in mid-March 2010, with an IPO valuation at US$3.6 billion.[41] The shares offered on the LSE raised just more than 500 million pounds.[42] In June the company was admitted to the FTSE 100 Index.[43]
In April 2011, Barrick beat a takeover offer for Equinox Minerals by China Minmetals.[44][45]
In August 2013 Barrick agreed to sell its Yilgarn South assets in Western Australia to South Africa’s Gold Fields for $US300 million divesting its granny smith darlot and lawlers mine operations.
In July 2014, Barrick announced changes to its executive management structure. Kevin Dushnisky and Jim Gowans (Current COO) have been appointed as Co-Presidents, taking responsibility for execution of the company's operating plans and strategic priorities. Current CFO, Ammar Al-Joundi is being promoted to Senior Executive Vice President. In conjunction with the restructuring, Jamie Sokalsky will be stepping down, effective September 15, 2014.
In March 2017 Barrick and Antofagasta plc announced that an arbitration tribunal of the World Bank's International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes had issued a decision in favor of the parties and that the Islamic Republic of Pakistan had unlawfully denied a mining lease for the Reko Diq Mine project in 2011. Reko Diq is located in the Balochistan province of Pakistan and was expected to require an initial capital investment of more than US$3 billion and is one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits. [46]
In 2017 Barrick reported it had formed a 50/50 joint venture with Goldcorp to consolidate the Cerro Casale Project in Chile as well as acquire Exeter Resource Corporation. [47]

Barrick is organized into ten operating units:[48]
• Five individual gold mines – Cortez, Goldstrike, Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Veladero
• Two gold mine portfolios – North America, Other and Australia Pacific
• 9% equity interest in African Barrick Gold plc
• One global copper business
• One project (Pascua-Lama)

Mining practices[edit]
Barrick Gold has been accused of a number of environmentally unsound practices by environmental groups.[52][53][54] The company has countered accusations by activists, challenging the accuracy of criticisms.[55] It reported environment-related spending of USD $89 million in 2009.[56]

Relations to local populations[edit]
In April and May 2008, indigenous leaders from four countries opposing large-scale gold mining on their lands described the adverse impacts of Barrick Gold Corporation. These leaders spoke of Barrick Gold's tactics in "suppressing dissident voices, dividing communities, and manipulating local and national politics".[57] They also related stories about "lack of free, prior and informed consent for local people".[57] Barrick is party to a lawsuit originally filed against Placer Dome Inc. by the local government claiming compensation for the 1996 Marcopper Mining Disaster. Barrick Gold inherited the litigation after taking over Placer Dome, Inc.[58]
In 2008, the company negotiated an agreement with four of five regional Western Shoshone tribes, providing financial resources for education and wellness initiatives, including a long-term scholarship program, allocated at the Tribes’ discretion.[59] A former tribal chairman of the Duck Valley Shoshone spoke of the company as "a pretty progressive entity."[60] In British Columbia the Tahltan Nation has thanked the company for encouraging local sustainable development while operating the Eskay Creek mine from 2001 to 2008.[61][62]
In 2010, Barrick Gold Corporation became the 18th company to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights[63] which provides "guidance to extractives companies on maintaining the security of their operations in a manner that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms."[64] Admission follows an eight step process that requires approval by the Voluntary Principles plenary,[65] the main decision-making body, consisting of all active members, drawn from participating governments, companies and non-governmental organizations.[66] Barrick Gold participates in a number of corporate social responsibility programs, such as the United Nations Global Compact.[67] The company is a signatory to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.[68] It also participates in The Global Reporting Initiative, Business for Social Responsibility[69] and The Global Business Coalition on HIV/Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria.[70] On September 7, 2007, Barrick was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.[71] The company is a member of The International Leadership Council (ILC) of The Nature Conservancy.[72] In Papua New Guinea, the Porgera Joint Venture participated in the development of a wildlife conservation area in the Kaijende Highlands.[73]
In 2011, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report that alleged that the private security force at Barrick's Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea had carried out "gang rapes and other violent abuses". Barrick conducted an internal investigation, assisted a police investigation and a number of security personnel were arrested and charged. HRW said the company should have "acted long before Human Rights Watch conducted its research prompted them into action" but had "taken meaningful steps to investigate past abuses and make it less likely for similar abuses to occur in future".[74][75] Barrick Gold revealed in 2013 that, after an independent investigation, the company was paying indemnities to 14 women raped by mine security guards in Tanzania. In addition to cash, the women were also receiving therapy, job training, relocation, and child education expenses. .[76]
Renewable energy[edit]




DeWind D8.2 2MW wind turbine[77] at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province, Argentina


In 2007, Barrick Gold installed the world's highest-situated wind turbine at the Veladero mine in San Juan Province (Argentina) at nearly 4,200m elevation.[77][78]
The company has made a request to Chile’s environmental authority, COREMA, to expand a proposed wind farm project in Chile’s Region IV from ten wind turbines to eighteen wind turbines, that would generate 36 megawatts of electricity into the national power grid.[79][80] In Nevada, Barrick operates a 1-megawatt solar panel farm.[81] There are also plans to build a 9-turbine wind farm at the Golden Sunlight mine in Montana when the operation closes.[82]
Legal controversy[edit]
In February 2010 lawyers for Barrick Gold threatened to sue the Canadian publisher Talonbooks for defamation if it proceeded with plans to publish the book Imperial Canada Inc.: Legal Haven of Choice for the World's Mining Industries by Alain Deneault.[83] Publisher Karl Siegler described this as "libel chill," pointing out that since the book had not yet been published, Barrick Gold could not know whether or not its contents actually constituted defamation.[84] Subsequently, Talon decided to publish the work (ISBN 9780889226357)[85] and ‘issued a statement saying they "intend to show the complete manuscript to Barrick prior to the book’s release, to allow Barrick the opportunity to ‘correct’ any ‘falsehoods’ about how they conduct their business affairs, worldwide, that they feel it may contain."’[86]
A 2011 decision in Quebec Superior Court had ruled that Barrick Gold had to pay $143,000 to authors Alain Deneault, Delphine Abadie, William Sacher and publisher Les Éditions Écosociété Inc, to prepare their defence in a “seemingly abusive” strategic lawsuit against public participation. Despite the Québec ruling, a book "Noir Canada" documenting the relationship between Canadian mining corporations, armed conflict and political actors in Africa was never published as part of a settlement which, according to the authors, was only made for the sole purpose of resolving the three-and-a-half year legal battle.[87]
Through 2009 and into 2010 Barrick Gold’s Cortez Hills project was the subject of litigation in Nevada, seeking to block the project.[88] Opponents appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, challenging a ruling in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, which denied the bid to block the project.[89] The Appeals Court "upheld a federal judge's finding that opponents of the mine failed to prove they were likely to prevail on claims the mine would cause visual harm to Mount Tenabo and create a substantial burden on the tribes' ability to exercise their religion" but ruled the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s previous environmental review of water and air pollution impacts "was inadequate under the National Environmental Policy Act" and ordered the District Court to provide "appropriate" injunctive relief while the Bureau of Land Management conducted further study.[90] In March 2011 the Bureau of Land Management approved a subsequent study on environmental impacts, allowing the mine to operate as originally proposed.[91]
Environmental issues[edit]
An official investigation, developed by a division of Argentina's Police Department, claims that at least five rivers in San Juan Province have been contaminated by a cyanide spill that occurred in September 2015. Nine Barrick Gold employees are now being investigated by Argentina's Federal Justice.[92][93]
Barrick Gold has confirmed the spill, and has also announced that it had to pay $145 million pesos (almost USS 10 million) in fines. The Company has publicly regretted the incident, and claims that the harmful effects have been corrected.[94]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
