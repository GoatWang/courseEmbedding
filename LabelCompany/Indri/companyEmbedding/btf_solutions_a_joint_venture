Q:
Why is money important?


A:
The primary importance of money stems from its economic benefits: money allows for the expansion of goods and products available to consumers and diversifies markets. Prior to the introduction of money into global economies, goods and services were exchanged in lieu of cash transactions. The barter system works when people need the skills and services of others and others need their expertise as well, but the demand for those services eventually decreases and the potential for market growth is much more limited than in a money-based market.
