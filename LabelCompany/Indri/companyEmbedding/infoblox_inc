SIMPLIFYING COMPLEX NETWORK MANAGEMENT

 
 

 
 






 
 
 


 
 




 
 
 
 



WHAT WE DO
 
 
 


Infoblox delivers Actionable Network Intelligence to enterprise, government, and service provider customers around the world. We are the industry leader in DNS, DHCP, and IP address management, the category known as DDI. We empower thousands of organizations to control and secure their networks from the core—enabling them to increase efficiency and visibility, improve customer service, and meet compliance requirements.
 
 

With Infoblox, organizations can protect against the rising flood of malware and cyberattacks that target networks; overcome complexity by creating a single point of control across traditional data centers as well as public and private cloud deployments; establish a single point of enforcement for security and compliance policies; and deliver actionable insights for making networks more reliable, efficient, and effective.

WHAT DRIVES US
 
The network is the connective tissue of today’s IT infrastructure and is critical to the success of any organization—more essential and also more vulnerable than ever. DDI services—DNS, DHCP, and IP address management—are mission critical. Yet managing and securing them is getting harder as networks become bigger and more complex. We are dedicated to simplifying network control and to using the invaluable data generated by core network services and threat intelligence to deliver actionable network intelligence.
 
 
 
 
 



What Makes Us Different
 
Building on almost twenty years of industry experience with Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and IP address management (IPAM) services (DDI), Infoblox has developed the Actionable Network Intelligence Platform. This platform goes beyond DDI to enable organizations to harness insights derived from the rivers of core services data moving through their networks to enhance all aspects of management, security, agility, and cost control.

OUR HISTORY
 
 
 





Infoblox revolutionized network services in 2000 when we delivered the first hardened DNS appliance, bringing a level of security and reliability that network managers could not achieve previously, and Infoblox has been an industry leader ever since.
 

In 2005, Infoblox debuted the SilverBox, an early nonstop DNS and DHCP appliance solution, and is now recognized as the leader in market share for DNS, DHCP, and IP address management (DDI) appliances.
 

Infoblox acquired iPANTO in 2007, making us an IPAM appliance leader.
 

In 2010, Infoblox acquired Netcordia to complement its core network services products with leading technologies for network task automation and automated change and configuration management.
 

On April 20, 2012, a group of Bloxers rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the completion of Infoblox’s initial public offering. The event was the culmination of over a decade of teamwork and dedication. Following the IPO, Infoblox’s annual revenues have grown significantly, and the Bloxer community has multiplied.
 

In 2016, Infoblox acquired IID, a leader in global cyberthreat intelligence, to enhance the company’s security solutions. Also in 2016, IDC named Infoblox the leader in DDI with 49.9 percent market share.

SECURE YOUR NETWORK
 
Mitigate DNS-based Attacks, Malware, and Data Exfiltration with Context-aware Security
 
 
 
 




 
Secure Your Network from the Core
 
The most common service targeted by application layer attacks is DNS1. In addition to targeting the DNS service itself, cybercriminals rely on it to infect devices, propagate malware, and exfiltrate data. Intruders often use DNS as a pathway to exfiltrate data because it’s commonly overlooked by security solutions that focus on firewalls, IDS, and proxies. Forty-six percent of large businesses have experienced data exfiltration via DNS2. In the first three months of 2016, victims paid an alarming $200M (US) in ransom to criminals3. Your business cannot afford the downtime, financial impact, customer churn, and legal ramifications stemming from cyberattacks on your network.
Infoblox security products enable you to mitigate security challenges that arise from DNS-based threats. Our secure DNS solutions combine automation, centralized reporting and policy management, enhanced visibility, and unique actionable intelligence drawn from the data residing in the core of your network.

Infoblox Inc. Key Developments

Infoblox Signs Exclusive Networks as Authorised Support Centre Partner
Jul 4 17
Infoblox has signed a partnership agreement with Exclusive Networks, enabling the distributor to act as an Infoblox Authorised Support Centre (ASC) in the Middle East. To become an ASC, Exclusive Networks has had to train and certify a number of technical specialists across the Middle East. Under the partnership, Exclusive Networks will offer 24x7 telephone and email support, technology health checks, and a range of hardware replacement options, as well as an engineer on site in various locations across the Middle East.


Infoblox Advances DNS Protection Helps Enterprises Mitigate Against Crippling DDoS Attacks
Apr 9 17
Infoblox Inc. announced its product for infrastructure protection, Advanced Domain Name System (DNS) Protection, is now available as a virtual offering with software subscription pricing. Infoblox Advanced DNS Protection prevents a wide range of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and other external and internal DNS-based attacks while maintaining DNS integrity and service availability. Designed to meet the growing adoption of cloud-first strategies and address the shift towards virtualization, Infoblox Advanced DNS Protection allows organizations the flexibility to deploy in physical and virtual environments. The security of the network and DNS servers are mission-critical because if the DNS server goes down, the entire network is shut off from the Internet.


Infoblox Delivers Elastic Secure DNS for Service Providers
Apr 6 17
Infoblox Inc. announced Infoblox Trinzic Flex, an elastically scalable carrier-grade virtual appliance that delivers network control, security, and automation. The dynamic nature of how users and devices connect and disconnect from networks, demands an infrastructure that can scale based on elastic customer demand. With more than 200 service provider customers, many of whom are investing in these next generation technologies, Infoblox Trinzic Flex enables service providers to auto-scale to meet the needs of these growing environments without replacing infrastructure. The expected growth in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) spending from $2.3 billion this year to $11.6 billion in 2019 provides a clear indicator that service providers must shift to scalable architectures. Infoblox Trinzic Flex allows service providers to improve service delivery and grow their network with minimal technology risk and cost, while transitioning from physical to virtualized infrastructure and leveraging technologies like NFV and SDN to future proof their networks. With deep integration into NFV, open source solutions like OpenStack and commercial solutions like VMware, Infoblox helps service providers to eliminate manual processes and accelerate delivery time and optimize performance management. The introduction of Infoblox Trinzic Flex creates the first NFV virtualized DDI (DNS, DHCP, and IP Address Management) appliance that provides elastic scaling capabilities. Through flexible capacity based pricing, service providers can pay based on their need and then grow as their needs grow. In addition to being able to scale, the service provider network must be secured to prevent disruptions in service. An often-overlooked security vulnerability revolves around DNS-based exploits that bypass traditional security approaches. Infoblox protects subscribers by using global threat intelligence and automated protection packages. The high-performance solution maintains critical DNS service availability in rapidly growing networks and even during malicious attacks. Sub-millisecond response and advanced threat protection maintains a low latency and a secure subscriber experience.

Infoblox, formally (NYSE:BLOX), is a privately held IT automation and security company based in California's Silicon Valley. The company focuses on managing and identifying devices connected to networks—specifically for the Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and IP address management.[3] According to Gartner, by 2015 the Infoblox market share was 49.9 percent of the $533 million enterprise DDI market. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
History[edit]
Infoblox was founded in 1999 in Chicago, Illinois, by Stuart Bailey who was at the University of Illinois.[5] The company moved to Santa Clara, California, in 2003.[6]
In 2010, Infoblox acquired Netcordia which provided technologies for network task automation.[7] Later in the same year, the company integrated Infoblox IP address management technology with Netcordia's network configuration and change management technologies.[8] As virtualization and cloud computing became increasingly prevalent in data centers, automation was marketed using the term distributed virtual infrastructure.[9] The company added DNS security products,[10][11] and it also supplies hardware appliances to host its software.[12] Infoblox joined commercial and government groups,[13][14][15][16] and independent research,[17] and made generally available as open-source software.[18]




Infoblox Inc. headquarters in Santa Clara, California


Network management became increasingly crucial,[19] after a sharp rise in computer crime, especially attacks that exploit DNS servers, such as DNS spoofing and distributed denial-of-service attacks. In 2012, 7.8 million new malware threats emerged.[20] Mobile threats grew by 1,000 percent, and 865 successful breaches compromised 174 million records.[21] DNS servers in particular are vulnerable to hacking, and often used in destructive attacks such as the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) attack that hit The New York Times and Twitter in 2013.[22][23] In December 2013, it estimated 6,000 customers,[24] which included government organizations as well as businesses.[25][16]
Infoblox received $80 million in five rounds of financing (2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005). The company's main investor was Sequoia Capital.[26] The company had their initial public offering on April 20, 2012. Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLOX.[5] The stock price advanced 40 percent in the first day of trading.[6] After adding 250 employees that year, Infoblox moved to Santa Clara.[27] Earnings leading up through Q4 2013 showed financial as well as physical growth. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $63.1 million, an increase of 40 percent on a year-over-year basis. Total net revenue for fiscal 2013 was a record $225.0 million, an increase of 33 percent compared with the total net revenue of $169.2 million in fiscal 2012.[28] First quarter results for 2014 fell short of expectations, causing a drop in share price.[29]
By 2015, the Infoblox market share in DDI jumped to 49.9 percent in 2015 from 46.7 percent in 2014, and the overall DDI market grew 18.3 percent in the same period to $533 million. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
On May 18th, 2016 founder Stuart Bailey awarded Clint Kaiser the First Customer Award at Bloxfest 2016 [30]. On September 19, 2016, Vista Equity Partners announced intent to purchase Infoblox for approximately $1.6 billion.[31] The acquisition closed in November.[32]

Infoblox, formally (NYSE:BLOX), is a privately held IT automation and security company based in California's Silicon Valley. The company focuses on managing and identifying devices connected to networks—specifically for the Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and IP address management.[3] According to Gartner, by 2015 the Infoblox market share was 49.9 percent of the $533 million enterprise DDI market. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
History[edit]
Infoblox was founded in 1999 in Chicago, Illinois, by Stuart Bailey who was at the University of Illinois.[5] The company moved to Santa Clara, California, in 2003.[6]
In 2010, Infoblox acquired Netcordia which provided technologies for network task automation.[7] Later in the same year, the company integrated Infoblox IP address management technology with Netcordia's network configuration and change management technologies.[8] As virtualization and cloud computing became increasingly prevalent in data centers, automation was marketed using the term distributed virtual infrastructure.[9] The company added DNS security products,[10][11] and it also supplies hardware appliances to host its software.[12] Infoblox joined commercial and government groups,[13][14][15][16] and independent research,[17] and made generally available as open-source software.[18]

Network management became increasingly crucial,[19] after a sharp rise in computer crime, especially attacks that exploit DNS servers, such as DNS spoofing and distributed denial-of-service attacks. In 2012, 7.8 million new malware threats emerged.[20] Mobile threats grew by 1,000 percent, and 865 successful breaches compromised 174 million records.[21] DNS servers in particular are vulnerable to hacking, and often used in destructive attacks such as the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) attack that hit The New York Times and Twitter in 2013.[22][23] In December 2013, it estimated 6,000 customers,[24] which included government organizations as well as businesses.[25][16]
Infoblox received $80 million in five rounds of financing (2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005). The company's main investor was Sequoia Capital.[26] The company had their initial public offering on April 20, 2012. Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLOX.[5] The stock price advanced 40 percent in the first day of trading.[6] After adding 250 employees that year, Infoblox moved to Santa Clara.[27] Earnings leading up through Q4 2013 showed financial as well as physical growth. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $63.1 million, an increase of 40 percent on a year-over-year basis. Total net revenue for fiscal 2013 was a record $225.0 million, an increase of 33 percent compared with the total net revenue of $169.2 million in fiscal 2012.[28] First quarter results for 2014 fell short of expectations, causing a drop in share price.[29]
By 2015, the Infoblox market share in DDI jumped to 49.9 percent in 2015 from 46.7 percent in 2014, and the overall DDI market grew 18.3 percent in the same period to $533 million. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
On May 18th, 2016 founder Stuart Bailey awarded Clint Kaiser the First Customer Award at Bloxfest 2016 [30]. On September 19, 2016, Vista Equity Partners announced intent to purchase Infoblox for approximately $1.6 billion.[31] The acquisition closed in November.[32]

Infoblox, formally (NYSE:BLOX), is a privately held IT automation and security company based in California's Silicon Valley. The company focuses on managing and identifying devices connected to networks—specifically for the Domain Name System (DNS), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, and IP address management.[3] According to Gartner, by 2015 the Infoblox market share was 49.9 percent of the $533 million enterprise DDI market. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
History[edit]
Infoblox was founded in 1999 in Chicago, Illinois, by Stuart Bailey who was at the University of Illinois.[5] The company moved to Santa Clara, California, in 2003.[6]
In 2010, Infoblox acquired Netcordia which provided technologies for network task automation.[7] Later in the same year, the company integrated Infoblox IP address management technology with Netcordia's network configuration and change management technologies.[8] As virtualization and cloud computing became increasingly prevalent in data centers, automation was marketed using the term distributed virtual infrastructure.[9] The company added DNS security products,[10][11] and it also supplies hardware appliances to host its software.[12] Infoblox joined commercial and government groups,[13][14][15][16] and independent research,[17] and made generally available as open-source software.[18]

Network management became increasingly crucial,[19] after a sharp rise in computer crime, especially attacks that exploit DNS servers, such as DNS spoofing and distributed denial-of-service attacks. In 2012, 7.8 million new malware threats emerged.[20] Mobile threats grew by 1,000 percent, and 865 successful breaches compromised 174 million records.[21] DNS servers in particular are vulnerable to hacking, and often used in destructive attacks such as the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) attack that hit The New York Times and Twitter in 2013.[22][23] In December 2013, it estimated 6,000 customers,[24] which included government organizations as well as businesses.[25][16]
Infoblox received $80 million in five rounds of financing (2000, 2001, 2003, 2004 and 2005). The company's main investor was Sequoia Capital.[26] The company had their initial public offering on April 20, 2012. Shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLOX.[5] The stock price advanced 40 percent in the first day of trading.[6] After adding 250 employees that year, Infoblox moved to Santa Clara.[27] Earnings leading up through Q4 2013 showed financial as well as physical growth. Total net revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 was $63.1 million, an increase of 40 percent on a year-over-year basis. Total net revenue for fiscal 2013 was a record $225.0 million, an increase of 33 percent compared with the total net revenue of $169.2 million in fiscal 2012.[28] First quarter results for 2014 fell short of expectations, causing a drop in share price.[29]
By 2015, the Infoblox market share in DDI jumped to 49.9 percent in 2015 from 46.7 percent in 2014, and the overall DDI market grew 18.3 percent in the same period to $533 million. No other competitor had a market share greater than 15 percent.[4]
On May 18th, 2016 founder Stuart Bailey awarded Clint Kaiser the First Customer Award at Bloxfest 2016 [30]. On September 19, 2016, Vista Equity Partners announced intent to purchase Infoblox for approximately $1.6 billion.[31] The acquisition closed in November.[32]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
